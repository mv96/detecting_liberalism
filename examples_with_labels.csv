 The liberal head of the delegation in the European Parliament, Andreas M√∂lzer, makes it clear about a report in today's edition of the daily newspaper ""Der Standard"", according to which he, M√∂lzer, assumes that the euro rescue will be successful. ""The euro rescue will be successful because it will be carried out by the EU establishment, whatever the cost. The EU leaders will not be able to bring themselves to realize that the monetary union is a flawed structure,"" explains M√∂lzer. In particular, economically successful countries such as Austria, Germany and the Netherlands will have to pay a high price, according to the liberal EU mandate. ""They will have to finance the euro rescue, which will lead to even greater burdens than before and increase inflation considerably. The consequence of this will be that the donor countries will have to make savings, especially in the social sector, and that this will also be the case in the economically healthy ones ""Euro countries will lead to impoverishment of broad sections of the population,"" warns M√∂lzer. The liberal MEP also assumes that Greece will leave the euro sooner or later. ""Even if Athens is reportedly given two more years to bring its deficit below the three percent mark, that won't be of much use because the country is too deep in the crisis.

24510.0," Commission sacrifices EU standards in favor of TTIP:_x000D_
 A new Greenpeace report shows that the EU Commission has withdrawn a report on genetically modified organisms after intensive lobbying by the USA. The report would have confirmed that organisms that have been modified using new genetic manipulation techniques fall under the EU's genetic engineering law. This means they could only be approved under strict conditions. The suppression of the report is intended to facilitate the TTIP negotiations with the USA. ""The Commission is thereby strengthening lobbies that want to allow genetic engineering in Europe. The agricultural industry sees TTIP as the lever with which they can spread genetic engineering throughout Europe and the Commission is supporting them in this,"" says Michel Reimon, MEP for the Greens. Once again it becomes clear that TTIP is intended to undermine European standards in the areas of environment and food in favor of Monsanto & Co.  _x000D__x000D_
""The EU Commission accepts that European standards will be undermined in favor of TTIP. Genetically modified organisms do not even have to be declared in supermarkets in the USA - consumers are completely in the dark about the origin of their food. The Commission cannot protect the health of Europeans for TTIP. Genetically modified organisms must be strictly controlled,"" said Reimon.

If Fischer, as he promised If he wanted to look at the constitutional questions very closely, then he could actually only come to the decision to refer the law back to the National Council, according to Strache. However, according to Strache, this presupposes that the Federal President sets aside the minimal interpretation of his office and move on to being an active head of state, as he announced during the election campaign. ‚ÄúStructural reforms in the red-white-red interests must be in the foreground,‚Äù ‚Äúis a sentence from the president that I can fully support,‚Äù emphasized Strache, who, however, misses relevant activities. ""Moderation and persuasion are not enough here, because it is about the future of Austria,"" said Strache, who called on the Federal President to pull the emergency brake in the country's interest. Strache emphasized that the budget leaves behind so many unfinished construction sites, such as school and education policy, the lack of health care reform and socially unbalanced measures, which a head of state cannot simply ignore. Also, or especially, the catastrophic situation of the Austrian armed forces should actually make the commander-in-chief rise to the barricades, stressed Strache, who called on Fischer to send a clear signal for Austria by refusing to sign the budget law.

11284.0," FP√ñ has once again become a dominant party in Austria:_x000D_
 On April 23, 2005, just over ten years ago, HC Strache was elected federal party chairman of the FP√ñ in Salzburg with 90.1 percent of the delegate votes and has since started his triumphant march for Austria. At today's ceremony in the parliamentary speaking room, which was also attended by officials from other parties, the FP√ñ chairman recalled the time. ""Most of us will remember what the FP√ñ was like back then. The BZ√ñ had split off, we were left with a gigantic mountain of debt, and in the polls we were at three percent or less. That was the situation ""To say the least, not necessarily easy,"" said HC Strache at the beginning of his speech. In the years since, the FP√ñ has been able to prove that it has endurance and determination. ""It certainly wasn't an easy path. Not only stones but whole boulders were thrown in our way often enough,"" said the FP√ñ leader, who was always convinced ""that the FP√ñ would be saved."" Under his leadership, the FP√ñ has once again become a dominant party in this country that has to be dealt with and ""without which it cannot be done."" Strache listed some important key data: ""We gave our first strong sign of life in the Vienna state elections in October 2005, where - despite all the prophecies of doom - we were able to achieve almost 15 percent of the vote. In 2010 we achieved almost 26 in Vienna Percent also increased steadily in the National Council elections. In 2006 it was 11 percent and 21 seats, in 2008 it was 17.5 percent and 34 seats and most recently in 2013 it was 20.5 percent and 40 seats."" The FP√ñ was also successful in the federal states, said the FP√ñ chairman, who is looking forward to the elections in Burgenland, Upper Austria and Styria with great confidence, where there could be a landslide victory for the FP√ñ. The citizens would again rely on the FP√ñ, which, according to HC Strache, has the leadership and exclusive representation in many fields. For example, on the topics of the EU, immigration, Islamization, neutrality, sovereignty, national defense, medium-sized businesses, tax relief, the labor market, administrative reform, seniors, families and youth. All areas where the FP√ñ represents clear positions and calls a spade a spade without blinders. Strache thanked everyone at his side and particularly singled out Honorary Chairman Hilmar Kabas, the Third President of the National Council Norbert Hofer, the two General Secretaries Herbert Kickl and Harald Vilimsky, but also the state party leaders and Ombudsman Peter Fichtenbauer:  _x000D__x000D_
""I would also like to thank our members of the National Council, state parliament and local councils, our employees, our officials, our members, our election workers, and everyone who contributed to the rebirth and resurgence of the FP√ñ. Without you, none of this would be possible been!"" Strache also thanked his mother, who was also present at the celebration, for her support. HC Strache also spoke about J√∂rg Haider. ""He was of course a great personality, someone who began as a political icebreaker to break up this entrenched red-black party system in Austria. Unfortunately, he was not successful in the long term, and unfortunately he also made numerous mistakes, one of which was the split from the FP√ñ in 2005 was probably his most difficult. But I met with him two days before his death in 2008 and we had a long, open conversation in which we reconciled on a human level after."" HC Strache has big plans for the future: ""These ten years were just the beginning. Now come the next ten years. From now on we will make even more lasting history than we have already managed to do so far. This will already be evident this year ""My personal goal is to become mayor in Vienna and to get over the thirty percent mark in Burgenland, Styria and Upper Austria."" The next goal is government participation at the federal level: ""Because of course we want to govern, not for our own sake, but for Austria. We want to implement our liberal ideas and programs in our homeland, at the federal level, in the states and in the municipalities and districts !""

249.0," Second-class status and ardent worship of EU centralism are the main characteristics of the new commissioners - the EU will therefore continue existing wrong paths:_x000D_
 The liberal EU delegation in the European Parliament will reject the EU Commission Barroso II, head of delegation Andreas M√∂lzer announced today. ""Unfortunately, the new EU Commission is essentially just a negative selection of failed politicians because they were voted out in their home countries. And the hearings of the new commissioners, at which nothing of substance was heard apart from the usual platitudes, impressively demonstrated the second-class status of the new commission members Proof,"" continued M√∂lzer. The liberal EU mandate sharply criticized the fact that all the designated commissioners were ardent supporters of the Lisbon Treaty and therefore also EU centralists. ""In the next five years, the wrong path that the European Union has been taking for a long time will continue. But the real challenges that Europe is facing, such as combating the economic crisis or strengthening its foreign policy profile, will not be able to be overcome "" said M√∂lzer. M√∂lzer took a harsh stance against some of the designated commission members: ""Catherine Ashton, the new 'EU Foreign Minister', has no foreign policy experience whatsoever. Furthermore, the British socialist, who has been elevated to the nobility, will ensure that the EU does not emancipate itself from the USA in terms of foreign policy With Ashton as 'EU Foreign Minister', Europe will not speak to the outside world with a strong voice, but at best with a squeaky voice,"" criticized M√∂lzer, who is also a member of the European Parliament's foreign policy committee. But at least, according to the FP√ñ MEP, there are a few new EU commissioners who stand out from the mediocrity. ""Reding from Luxembourg has already done a good job as media commissioner, Georgiewa from Bulgaria has experience in international organizations as the previous vice president of the World Bank and Johannes Hahn was able to score points at his hearing with his friendly non-committal nature,"" emphasized M√∂lzer. The liberal MEP described the fact that ex-communists would also be represented in the next EU Commission as extremely problematic. ""The Czech Stefan F√ºle, for example, who will be responsible for the enlargement department for the next five years and who is also a proven supporter of Turkey's accession, was a member of the Communist Party from 1982 to 1989 and studied at an elite Soviet university. And the previous one Administrative Commissioner, Siim Kallas, who is also Vice-President of the Commission and is now responsible for transport agendas, began his professional career at the end of the 1970s in the Ministry of Finance of the then Estonian Soviet Republic,"" explained M√∂lzer. Consequently, F√ºle and Kallas would have laid the foundation for their careers in communist states, which would not have been possible without a sympathy for this criminal totalitarianism of the 20th century or without the corresponding ideological reliability. ""Of course, every person can change their political attitude over the years, but it would still be interesting to find out how they feel about it today. In any case, the examples of F√ºle and Kallas show that in the politically over-correct EU there is a possible proximity to the red totalitarianism of the 20th century . Century doesn't seem to be a problem,"" noted M√∂lzer. According to M√∂lzer, for the reasons mentioned, the liberal delegation in the EU Parliament will refuse to give its consent to the new Commission. ""Unfortunately, only the EU Commission as a whole and not the individual commissioners are voted on, which is highly questionable in terms of democratic policy.

 In view of the horrendous payments that Austria has to pay into the ESM and other EU rescue measures, it would only be right and fair if we discounted the EU contribution payments, said the liberal Secretary General NAbg. Herbert Kickl. ‚ÄúAs long as there continues to be massive capital flight from countries that need EU help, such as Greece, our contributions must be frozen,‚Äù said Kickl. ‚ÄúWe would be compensating for this tax evasion with our payments,‚Äù said Kickl, who called for an immediate stop to payments. It is high time to freeze our own contributions until Greece and the like finally get hold of their tax evaders and tax evaders and the capital flight is stopped, said Kickl. It is incomprehensible that the Austrian taxpayers finance a tax-free luxury life for the PIIGS billionaires and millionaires, said Kickl. The Austrian federal government must finally take action here and negotiate a discount, especially since our payments into the rescue package would already threaten our own national finances, demanded Kickl. In view of the latest findings from the EU Troika and the assessment of the rating agency Moody's, Kickl also called for a ""payment ice age"" for Greece. Although Austria is certified as having a Triple-A status, there is also talk of a ‚Äúnegative outlook‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe aid to Greece is already threatening our own government finances,‚Äù said Kickl.

 The EU financial report discussed at today's meeting of the Court of Auditors' Committee in Parliament shows ""very clear failures on the part of the federal government,"" said the liberal NAbg. Mag. Roman Haider. According to the EU Commission's calculation method, the Austrian net contribution rose to 563.7 million euros from 2006 to 2007. ‚ÄúThat corresponds to an increase rate of 87 percent in just one year,‚Äù says Haider. In addition, the Court of Auditors also criticizes the incomplete and sometimes less transparent presentation of returns from the EU in the federal budget. ‚ÄúFor example, the programs processed by the ERP fund are only partially shown and the returns to higher education institutions are not shown at all,‚Äù says Haider. Haider sees the fact that the Court of Auditors is not able to control recipients of direct EU funding as particularly worthy of criticism. ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need for repairs for the government here,‚Äù said Haider. The report also clearly shows that the burden on municipalities in EU payments has increased by around 24 percent since 2000, while the burden on the states has ""only"" increased by 18.5 percent. ‚ÄúSince there is no prospect of a sustainable improvement in the situation of the communities, the federal government must relieve the communities through financial equalization,‚Äù demanded Haider in conclusion.

564.0," Eduard Moschitz from the editorial team ‚ÄúAm Schauplatz‚Äù motivates skinheads to shout ‚ÄúSieg Heil‚Äù - FP√ñ will submit an advertisement:_x000D_
 FP√ñ federal party chairman HC Strache spoke today in Wiener Neustadt at the closing event for the Lower Austrian municipal council elections in front of around 500 enthusiastic citizens. After the event, however, an outrageous incident occurred. After his speech, HC Strache went to the citizens as always to give autographs, have his photo taken with people and talk to them. He noticed that he was being accompanied by a camera, but he couldn't tell which channel it was coming from. While Strache was signing autographs, a strangely acting gentleman tried to provoke him with strange questions, such as whether he was ""happy that you got the biggest applause from the right-wing radicals"", to which the FP√ñ chairman replied that he didn't see any right-wing radicals. but only left-wing extremists who tried to disrupt the event and were sometimes violent. The man, who later turned out to be ORF editor Eduard Moschitz, continued to make provocative statements and spoke of ""bald people"" who were present, although this was not the case at the time. As Strache continued to walk through the crowd and have his photo taken with the citizens, he met three bald people who said to him: ""The camera is our photo."" Strache then turned around and wrote autographs for other people, remarking that this probably wasn't possible. Meanwhile, Moschitz came to the three bald men and literally asked them: ‚ÄúFinally say it!‚Äù Whereupon one of the three skinheads shouted ‚ÄúSieg Heil‚Äù. Strache, who had turned around, then said to Moschitz: ""I heard that. You summoned these people here."" The FP√ñ chairman insisted that the police take the data and explained that he wanted to file a complaint. Apparently it was an agent provocateur who knows people from the neo-Nazi scene and was summoned to the event. When the personal details were recorded, it turned out that it was Eduard Moschitz from the ORF editorial team ‚ÄúAm Schauplatz‚Äù. So he used the dirtiest manipulation methods to set up three neo-Nazis and prepared everything so that they would utter Nazi slogans, which he then documented. Moschitz also admitted that he knows the three skinheads and has been accompanying them for several days. According to the prohibition law, he made himself an accomplice. The FP√ñ will submit an advertisement on Monday and also refer it to the ORF audience council. Strache was deeply shocked by this incident. ""A manipulative dirt bucket campaign is apparently being started here, which the ORF is trying to organize professionally. With the exception of the three neo-Nazis brought along by the ORF editor, there were only decent citizens at the event. These ORF methods are deeply disgusting and reminiscent of totalitarian systems . Luckily I heard how Moschitz motivated the skinheads, otherwise these vile manipulation methods would have remained undetected.""

 The EU's criticism of the Hungarian government is pure hypocrisy, said the liberal delegation leader in the European Parliament, Andreas M√∂lzer, in the run-up to today's debate on the situation of fundamental rights in Hungary. ""This is not about fundamental rights, but rather about pillorying the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban because he consistently puts Hungary's legitimate interests at the center of his politics,"" emphasized M√∂lzer.

""State broadcasting is firmly in the hands of the governing parties, and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãprint media one can speak less of diversity and more of conformity.

4219.0," Judge apparently obsessed with the intent to convict:_x000D_
 The liberal Secretary General NAbg spoke today of ‚Äúpolitical justice of the worst kind against a blameless and innocent person‚Äù. Herbert Kickl, in view of the scandalous judgment in Klagenfurt. This misjudgment will go down as a stain in the history of the judiciary. In front of the public, there was a clearly politically motivated attempt to criminalize the Freedom Party in the person of Uwe Scheuch because the government could not democratically get them under control, according to Kickl. The judge was apparently obsessed with his intention to convict from the very beginning and had already delivered the verdict all set and ready. Instead of looking for justice, he coldly carried out the will of the political establishment in Austria in the courtroom. One indication of this is, for example, that a press release from the SP√ñ appeared in the OTS at the same time as the APA report of the announced judgment, says Kickl, who sees it as proven that the SP√ñ already knew in advance which ""judgment"" would come out. Throughout his entire negotiation, the judge persistently denied the core of the legal question and coldly dismissed each and every one of the many arguments for exoneration. ""Something like this only happens in totalitarian regimes,"" said Kickl, who undermines the integrity of the entire Austrian judiciary through the unscrupulous actions of certain circles, which include the Klagenfurt judge as well as the Green head of the so-called corruption prosecutor's office and those responsible in the Supreme Court , who had insisted on the hearing in Klagenfurt, are now finally massively threatened. Apparently the Freedom Party is fair game for politically motivated judges in the considerations of permanent political losers, said Kickl, who fully supports Scheuch's decision to appeal. ‚ÄúSuch justice must be met with our most determined resistance,‚Äù emphasized Kickl. It is clear to anyone who follows what is happening that there are clearly double standards in Austria, criticized Kickl, who referred to the Burgstaller case, in which the Salzburg governor emerged completely unscathed from the citizenship affair surrounding art patron Igor Vidyaev. who was promised and given Austrian citizenship for his sponsorship of the Salzburg Easter Festival. All the facts are on the table here, including intervention by Chancellor Faymann. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to the red Burgstaller, no finger is lifted, while Uwe Scheuch, where there is absolutely nothing to condemn, is being hit with the legal bihander,‚Äù said Kickl. The ""ulcer"" that is at issue in this specific case is not, as the judge put it in his reasons for the verdict, any kind of corruption, because this was never present for a second, but rather a partisan judge who felt empowered, as a willing political stooge to act against an unpleasant competitor, says Kickl. ""While in Austria, for example, convicted child molesters or violent criminals are attacked with kid gloves, an example is being made of an innocent politician who would not even have had the theoretical possibility of committing the offense he was accused of,"" Kickl commented on this scandalous verdict. ‚ÄúThe population will recognize what disgraceful game is being played here,‚Äù said Kickl, who emphasized that the FP√ñ will not allow itself to be stopped by such methods.

 FP√ñ General Secretary Harald Vilimsky was outraged today by the next scandalous derailment by the presenter of the ORF parliamentary magazine ‚ÄúHohes Haus‚Äù, Patricia Pawlicki. In yesterday's edition, Pawlicki asked the following question regarding the FP√ñ in an interview with National Council President Wolfgang Sobotka: ""How long can the √ñVP support this kind of polemic and agitation as a Christian party?"" Vilimsky explained this. ""Pawlicki is once again abusing public broadcasting and spewing poison and bile against the FP√ñ. This behavior is unacceptable and must lead to consequences.""

In addition to reports about rapid and intensive investigations by the public prosecutor's office and the questioning of former √ñBB employees Grandees as witnesses will be Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann and State Secretary Dr. Josef Ostermayer accused by another former √ñBB managing director. After many years as a local councilor and housing councilor as well as as editor of selected media in Vienna, Faymann, as transport minister, sent an increased volume of advertisements to precisely these media.  ""These decision-makers, including ex-√ñBB boss Martin Huber, reported to the investigators that they had direct influence on the allocation of advertisements. Above all through Ostermayer, now State Secretary in the Chancellery.  A former √ñBB manager also confirms the information he gave to the investigators to the KURIER: ""Ostermayer always disparaged our advertising campaigns - especially those on television - and said that we need to advertise more in print products. Even though ""We won an advertising award for the first time for our TV spot.""  The √ñBB manager adds: ""We constantly felt forced and under pressure when it came to the advertisements.

However, this bill was also paid from the √ñBB budget.

Federal Minister Faymann commissioned us to publish in our ST/A/R newspaper No. 19 (publication date:  September 2008) to create an 8-page report on the large transport buildings."" This letter was garnished with an advertisement wishing to be financed by the √ñBB. The name Faymann was later actually emblazoned on the cover of the small glossy magazine.  Furthermore, an ex-√ñBB decision-maker is now said to have said about the 500,00 euro cooperation with the Krone: ""I only found out about the 21 double pages when the first double page appeared in the Krone. Also according to the √ñ1 Mittagsjournal, there is new excitement about advertisements about Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann, this time it's about advertising by the Federal Chancellery for the Ministry of Health. On September 19, 2011, the PR Ethics Council called for questionable √ñBB advertisements to be clarified. Unfortunately, it has become common practice in recent years. According to the Ethics Council, the government factions have now decided to set up an Austrian advertising advisory board that will define the extent to which government members should issue and design advertisements following Urgent inquiry 1.

If not, how do you explain the statement by ex-√ñBB boss Martin Huber, who reported in connection with a conversation with Horst P√∂chhacker that ""seven million from the advertising budget in 2008 had to be reserved for Werner""?  12. Have you, your state secretary or your employees concluded advertising agreements with newspapers at the expense of state-affiliated companies?  13. If not, how do you explain the √ñBB document from September 3, 2007, in which it says: ""Minister Faymann agreed to a multi-part cooperation ""Our Railway"" with the Kronen Zeitung in 2007. The following costs apply: one-off Euro 500,000 (...)""?  14. How do you explain the alleged falsification of this document, especially since your name no longer appears in a later version?  15. Can you rule out that you, your State Secretary or your employees initiated this falsification?  16. Have you, your state secretary or your employees commissioned advertisements directly from newspapers to the detriment of state-affiliated companies?  17. If so, what consequences for your office do you draw from ASFINAG's audit report for 2007, according to which an advertisement was not commissioned by ASFINAG, but rather the order came directly from BM Faymann's office and the newspaper was informed that the invoice should be sent to ASFINAG?  18. How do you explain the addition ‚Äúaccording to Mr. Faymann‚Äù on the ‚Äúprofit‚Äù invoice addressed to Alois Schedl?  19. How do you explain the following wording in an invoice from the NEWS publishing group to an √ñBB advertising agency from June 2008: ""Your customer: Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, Vienna.

This candidacy is an excellent example of the persistence with which the SP√ñ wants to remain in power at K√ºniglberg, said Kickl. During his time in office, Wrabetz had impressively shown how, as a political puppet of the SP√ñ, one could make one mistake after another and then - despite the crooked appearance - move lightly over them, Kickl commented on the General Director's ""achievement"". In addition to the economically poor management of the ORF, Wrabetz did not succeed in delivering the high-quality programming that could be expected from a public broadcaster, emphasizes Kickl. During his time in office, Wrabetz was particularly distinguished by one thing, namely acting as an extended arm of L√∂welstrasse on K√ºniglberg. ‚ÄúHe succeeded in this part of his administration remarkably well!‚Äù said Kickl. Time and again - and completely blatantly - the viewers of the ORF program have been confronted with red party radio in recent years. This ranges from the conscious concealment of the FP√ñ, to emphatically negative reporting and the one-sided invitation policy for discussion programs, to targeted campaigns against the FP√ñ. In this context, Kickl mentions as an outstanding example the attempted manipulation of the reportage program ""Am Schauplatz"", where a systematic attempt was made to denigrate the FP√ñ by bringing in Nazi extras in order to bring them into a direct connection with the Freedom Party . The ORF urgently needs to be brought into a new era. For Kickl, this is only possible with the end of Wrabetz at K√ºniglberg. The goal must be an ORF that is as independent as possible with an adequate public service program.

Europe does not benefit from immigration, said the liberal delegation leader in the European Parliament, Andreas M√∂lzer, today in response to the responsible EU Commissioner Laszlo Andor's answer to his written question on high unemployment among migrants (E-010695/2011).

11666.0," Things became relatively quiet again around the Ukraine conflict. ‚ÄúThe simmering conflict continues to represent a massive threat to our energy security,‚Äù warns FP√ñ National Council member Gerhard Deimek, who represents his party on the Energy Advisory Board and Energy Steering Advisory Board. The reverse flow to Ukraine must be stopped completely and excluded in the future. Domestic political issues overshadowed the still simmering Ukraine conflict. ‚ÄúThe federal government must not forget its responsibility. Even after these hot summer days, winter is coming again,‚Äù Deimek calls for a solution-oriented policy. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko recently declared that his country would be independent of Russian gas supplies in two years. ‚ÄúThis could probably only be possible by reselling originally Russian gas to Ukraine. However, this tactic would be extremely dangerous for Europe's energy supply,‚Äù insists Deimek, calling for an end to all reverse flow measures. ""The train continues on the dangerous journey towards the energy union. But we Austrians must not become an extended arm of American politics and their Polish companions,"" says Deimek, wishing for a more self-confident policy. ""When Donald Tusk speaks of the Energy Union, he means a foreign policy weapon. This project would be the opposite of security of supply and would be reflected in significantly higher gas prices on the domestic market,"" Deimek reminds us that the Soviet Union even in the hottest phases of the cold Was a reliable energy supplier during the war.

 ""I am always delighted when socialism  _x000D__x000D_
a clear rejection is given, as was actually the case yesterday in the United Kingdom. After Hungary, another important European country has achieved a conservative victory that was urgently needed not only for Great Britain but also for Europe. We libertarians value the Tories above all because of their Euro-critical standpoints, which are oriented towards the interests of their own people. We share numerous common points of view with the 'Conservative Party', which is not a member of the Christian Democratic European People's Party group in the European Parliament, but rather makes up the majority of the right-wing conservative group of 'European Conservatives and Reformists'. Even if David Cameron does not have the hoped-for absolute majority in the House of Commons, I still expect Gordon Brown to vacate his seat immediately so that a government led by the Tories can work,"" says MP Dr. Johannes H√ºbner, foreign and European policy officer Spokesman for the Freedom Party, stated that this election clearly demonstrated the injustices and inadequacies of the British majority voting system. The will of the voters was only partially manifested in the ‚ÄúHouse of Commons‚Äù. For example, the Liberal Democrats received 23 percent of the votes, but only had 8. 5 percent of the mandates because they failed to capture numerous constituencies. Labor, on the other hand, achieved 41 percent of the mandates with only 29.3 percent of the vote. H√ºbner describes the fact that hundreds of Britons were expelled from the polling stations because of the time for voting was exceeded or there were not enough ballot papers available. The challenge for David Cameron and his government in the coming years will primarily be to rehabilitate the country that has been run down by the Labor Party - i.e. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The initial ‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù of the Tony Blair era was merely the sprouting of the seeds that Margaret Thatcher had sown in the 1980s. In contrast to Brown, Cameron is not a ponderous old-style socialist but a modern conservative who is concerned with a profound reform of British society, H√ºbner analyzes the political situation in the United Kingdom. ""I'm curious to see whether the future Prime Minister David Cameron will involve the new Tory mastermind, Phillip Blond, in the restructuring of Great Britain. Blond is committed to an economic order that turns away from the current neoliberalism and monopolism. The unbundling of capital that he demands and restrictions on multinational corporations seem to me to be a promising answer because it offers the middle class the opportunity to 'play' in a real market economy again. I also like Phillipe Blond's approaches to supporting families and children more and his efforts to do so ""Renewing social behavior by returning to traditional values ‚Äã‚Äãis very likeable,"" says H√ºbner, outlining his expectations of the new man in 'Downing Street number ten'.

 ‚ÄúVienna is increasingly becoming the scene of foreign gang wars,‚Äù criticized FP√ñ federal party leader HC Strache today. The shooting with two seriously injured people, which took place on the Vienna Belt during the night from Saturday to Sunday, once again shows clearly how devastating the situation is with security in the federal capital. Since the opening of Schengen to the East, Vienna has become an Eldorado for criminal gangs in the East, as recent events have once again clearly demonstrated, explained Strache. But the mayor apparently doesn't care at all; as usual, H√§upl turns a blind eye to the grievances in this city. But that is not surprising for someone who is supported in the election campaign by rappers who glorify violence. Strache demanded that gang crime be dealt with with all due severity. Vienna needs at least 1,500 additional police officers and a city guard. Furthermore, the Schengen borders would have to be suspended again and again, temporarily and without notice. There is finally a need for a zero-tolerance policy towards crime. ‚ÄúHow many more shootings and gang wars does it take until the mayor wakes up?‚Äù asked Strache. ""For us libertarians, the safety of our citizens is our top priority. That's why something must be done now, before the situation escalates to such an extent that it is too late. The gang wars must be stopped now. Anyone who does not comply with our laws must be expelled immediately to become.""

2889.0," Deficit countries are apparently not able to repay debts through austerity policies alone - the way for exiting the euro or bankruptcy must be paved:_x000D_
 Thanks to Finance Minister Pr√∂ll's catastrophic policies, Austria is already one of the European AAA countries that has to pay the highest interest rates for government bonds. By partially waiving debt repayments from Greece and Ireland, Austria would be maneuvered into a precarious financial situation in the long term, said FP√ñ federal party leader HC Strache today in response to Wifo boss Aiginger's suggestions. In addition, the expansion of the euro rescue package, which Aiginger also called for, should also be fundamentally rejected. The protective shield was the wrong instrument to stabilize the monetary union from the outset. Strache emphasizes again that only a reorganization of the euro zone with regard to the possibility for bankrupt states to go into orderly insolvency and a voluntary exit from the monetary union could be effective in the long term. The net contributor countries would be placed under such extreme strain by the rescue package that the damage would inevitably fall on the taxpayers. ‚ÄúOur tax-paying citizens cannot be expected to do this,‚Äù says Strache, emphasizing his call for a sensible rethink regarding a core European hard currency network. If the course were now set - also in the spirit of Aiginger - for cementing and expanding a permanent financial injection, which could then be given whenever required, this would mean nothing other than a carte blanche for deficit offenders in the euro zone. In any case, countries like Austria would ultimately play into the hands of international speculators with massive financial contributions, said Strache, who emphatically calls on the federal government to stop this game of liability for loss-making states. According to experts, as things currently stand, they are hardly in a position to even come close to meeting the repayments through austerity measures.

 FP√ñ federal party chairman HC Strache and FP√ñ general secretary Herbert Kickl today presented the second wave of posters for the 2013 National Council election campaign. There are a total of three subjects with a total of 3,000 posters. The slogans are: We help in our own country first - Red-Black helps the bank & speculator Asylum fraudsters have to leave - Red-Black doesn't want to understand that Not a cent for bankrupt states - Red-Black sold us and betrayed us This is always the one below Button already known from the previous posters with the inscription: High time for ‚Äúcharity‚Äù. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, with these posters we are of course addressing the issue of the EU and the aid payments to countries like Greece,‚Äù explained Strache. The euro crisis has by no means been overcome; in fact, a third rescue package for Greece is imminent, as German Finance Minister Sch√§uble admitted a few days ago. In this context, Strache criticized Faymann and Spindelegger's dullness in European politics. ‚ÄúIf we advertise that we want to help in our own country first, instead of speculators and banks, as the SP√ñ and √ñVP do, this affects many sections of the population who are acutely affected by the risk of poverty,‚Äù explained Strache and explained this based on the situation of pensioners . Politicians must meet the needs of these people and calculate pension adjustments based on the pensioner price index. It is unacceptable that the majority of Austrian senior citizens are being driven further and further into the poverty trap. But apart from occasional lip service, the SP√ñ and √ñVP do not do the slightest thing for Austria's pensioners. ""Instead, Faymann and Spindelegger prefer to send Austrian tax money to Greece and Brussels in order to save bankrupt banks and speculators,"" said Strache. The new posters are also dedicated to the topic of asylum fraud. ""The fact is that the majority of those who come to us are not real refugees for political, religious or ethnic reasons, but are simply economic refugees, some of whom even work as smugglers.

12261.0," Do not discuss the distribution of migration flows, but rather their prevention:_x000D_
 ‚ÄúThe asylum summit organized today by the SP√ñ and √ñVP failed as expected. The result is a continuation of muddling along as before, only now at a lower level,‚Äù said the liberal federal party chairman HC Strache. ‚ÄúIf we had listened to the FP√ñ from the beginning of the uncontrolled migration, such a summit would not have been necessary,‚Äù said Strache. With the summit, the government, with the help of the state governors, tried to repair the shambles it had caused. However, this is with completely the wrong aim in mind. Strache emphasized that the issue should not have been the best possible distribution of migrants, but rather preventing the influx of economic refugees. According to the FP√ñ, the upper limit has already been exceeded for the coming years if last year's asylum applications are taken into account. It is therefore not about more immigration, but rather about the rapid deportation of those who are not entitled to asylum. ‚ÄúEvery economic migrant takes away the place of a war refugee who is actually threatened with life and limb. ‚ÄúThat probably can‚Äôt be in the spirit of the inventor of the Geneva Refugee Convention, which, by the way, urgently needs to be adapted to the new circumstances,‚Äù said Strache. If the SP√ñ/√ñVP summit now relies on a tight Schengen border, then this plan has already failed. ‚ÄúThis border is leaky like a noodle sieve and will remain so in the near future,‚Äù said Strache. Austria must therefore protect its own borders, as the Hungarians have shown us very successfully, said Strache. It is also wrong to place the emphasis on integration, because the goal must be for those entitled to asylum to quickly return to their home countries after their asylum reason no longer applies and to help rebuild their countries, stressed Strache. The fact that the coalition no longer speaks of an ‚Äúupper limit‚Äù but of a ‚Äúguideline‚Äù and a ‚Äúplanning variable‚Äù shows the absurdity of the undertaking and is reminiscent of the border fence, which was not allowed to be called ‚Äúfence‚Äù, said Strache. Strache is certain that with such vague specifications regarding the choice of words and the number of refugees, the concept could never be implemented successfully. The solution could only be zero immigration, because Austria has already far exceeded its capacity limits.

4422.0," Which planet does the ORF broadcast from?:_x000D_
 In view of today's press session with √ñVP Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger, the question arises as to which planet the ORF is broadcasting from, said the liberal Secretary General NAbg. Herbert Kickl. ‚ÄúThe question and choice of topic is so far removed from reality that it has already taken on bizarre features,‚Äù says Kickl. Otherwise, an unimaginative Spindelegger has positioned himself as a good estate manager for the √ñVP, said Kickl. Just in the last three minutes, the questioners remembered that Spindelegger was also Foreign Minister and asked him about the affront of the Turkish government, which wants to freeze its relations with the EU during the Cyprus presidency, criticized Kickl. The right answer here must clearly be an immediate termination of all accession negotiations with Turkey, because with this action Turkey has once again proven that it has absolutely nothing to do with a democratic EU, emphasized Kickl, who misses such a consistent stance from the Foreign Minister. Kickl also missed a statement from the √ñVP boss on the allegations of infidelity and abuse of office against Chancellor Faymann and his whisperer Ostermayer. ‚ÄúThere is apparently a new coalition agreement here to cover up each other,‚Äù suspects Kickl after yesterday‚Äôs rumored mega row between red and black. Also not mentioned at all were reform ideas or even concrete reform proposals from the red-black coalition, criticized Kickl, who sees the reason as being that these simply do not exist. Instead, Spindelegger is philosophizing about a bonus-malus system for pensioners, which will probably only end in a penalty. Not a word about the untenable pension privileges of former politicians, which would cost the state hundreds of millions of euros every year, said Kickl. In addition, says Kickl, it is absolutely unbelievable for someone like Spindelegger, who has abolished the single-earner tax credit and employs a state secretary who wants to intervene in existing pensions, to talk about pension justice. Spindelegger also didn't say a word about the lack of inflation compensation for pensioners, criticized Kickl. But Spindelegger has once again impressively proven that he, and with him the Austrian Federal Government, is completely clueless when it comes to the Greek and euro crisis, said Kickl. To peddle the FP√ñ's proposals for a constitutionally stipulated debt freeze is objectively pleasing, but it also shows that there is a lack of one's own ideas, says Kickl. The global economic crisis will not be solved by reforming the √ñBB, as Spindelegger suggested.

Now we are trying to restore a fraction of these destroyed jobs with a few measures that are only effective in the short term. ‚ÄúIn reality, this is a highly dishonest policy and a mockery of the unemployed and companies,‚Äù said Kickl.

 ‚ÄúCompleting the asylum check at the EU‚Äôs external borders would be an important step in the fight against illegal migration,‚Äù explained today Harald Vilimsky, head of the liberal delegation in the European Parliament and FP√ñ General Secretary. ""The current dilemma of the European asylum system is that everyone has to be admitted, then travel on to the country of their choice at will, apply for asylum there and then - even if the application is decided negatively - is far too often not deported,"" said Vilimsky.  Vilimsky basically supports a proposal that the German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now put forward, according to which migrants who are not in need of protection should be sent back to their countries of origin at the external border with the support of Frontex. ‚ÄúOf course it would be best if people stayed in their region and were helped locally,‚Äù said Vilimsky. ""But for those who are still making their way towards Europe, the proposal is a step in the right direction. If we want secure external borders, then that means: Nobody should be able to get through who doesn't have a right to it. A determination of the need for protection at the external border and return to the countries of origin if there is no reason for protection are the right approach,"" said Vilimsky. It also corresponds to the spirit of the Council decision of June 2018, which provides for asylum centers near the border. The liberal MEP also recalled that, according to the EU's official asylum data for 2018 and 2019, around two thirds of the asylum decisions were negative - meaning that these people are neither entitled to refugee status nor to subsidiary protection. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs goal must be to intercept such illegal migrants at the external border,‚Äù said Vilimsky.

""The fact that unemployment among foreign employees has risen again by 20.5 percent should actually set off alarm bells for the SP√ñ minister.

Although Hundstorfer is spending 1.1 billion euros in AMS funds for training this year alone, unemployment continues to rise sharply. In addition, the responsible minister is not prepared to provide the Austrian Parliament with information about the actual use of the AMS funds, according to the liberal social spokesman. ""The Austrian employees and employers will probably have a rude awakening when it comes to the 2014/2015 Budget Accompanying Act.

Around half of those surveyed also stated that the rules of their religion are above the laws in Austria. Two thirds of Afghans also view Jews as the enemy of all Muslims. ‚ÄúThese results are shocking and show that we have allowed the wrong people into our country in recent years.

Instead of facing the truth, they try to put these shameful excesses into perspective or even distract from them with unqualified statements.

But they also lie in a solution to the question of distribution: ""It cannot be accepted that a few states which Austria also belongs to, bear the entire burden.‚Äù On all of these points, Europe is ‚Äúlagging behind,‚Äù said Doskozil. Austria is therefore forced to implement ‚Äúsecond-best‚Äù national measures. **** Unfortunately, Austria cannot fall back on European repatriation agreements; the European Frontex agency is ‚Äúnot in a position to organize external border measures quickly enough.‚Äù The Central European defense ministers have therefore developed concrete proposals to protect the EU's external borders, which, among other things, provide for: to establish increased police and military cooperation where necessary. ‚ÄúThe pace at EU level is too slow,‚Äù criticized Doskozil. According to the minister, there is also no further development with regard to common EU asylum procedures and standards. Against this background, Doskozil does not see any point in criticizing the so-called Visegrad states for their actions. He is not a defender of this, but Hungary alone recorded 175,000 border crossings from Serbia last year. ‚ÄúThese states have lost trust in the EU's options for action; this trust must be regained instead of harassing these states. And that will only succeed if Europe manages to secure its external borders. The Defense Minister assured that Austria would continue to be involved at all levels in the future, both in terms of border protection measures and foreign and domestic missions. ‚ÄúWe cannot always just demand from the EU,‚Äù said Doskozil. ‚ÄúWe have to step forward ourselves when there is not enough movement,‚Äù which is why Austria is involved in the EU Mediterranean mission ‚ÄúSophia‚Äù and supports Hungary in securing the external border with Serbia. There is also the question of how the common EU security policy will develop in the broader context. Austria is committed to increasing cooperation in the interests of security, but it is also clear that Austria would not participate in any supranationally organized EU army due to its neutrality. However, Austria will continue to participate in foreign operations and NATO-led missions under the premise of an ‚Äúinterest-driven neutrality policy‚Äù. Austria will comply with the national goals, such as compliance with the benchmark. ‚ÄúI am convinced that we have done our homework.

 In addition to concerns about the workplace and the economic environment, the question of the objective and subjective sense of security is at the top of the priority list for Austrians. That is why we have chosen the topic of security for today's current hour in the National Council, explained √ñVP security spokesman Abg. Werner Amon MBA at the beginning of the debate in the plenary session of the National Council. Aware of the current, not easy situation - keyword border management and Brenner - Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka has already tackled the problem directly in the short time he has been in charge of ministerial responsibility and achieved a good European solution in which Italy also fulfills its role, said Amon. ""Of course, our security organs would be able to fully ramp up border management within a very short time. But as long as that is not necessary, we can keep the Schengen area open."" ‚ÄúWe also chose the topic of internal security because a whole series of incidents related to the massive migration movement have recently led to uncertainty among the population,‚Äù Amon continued. Although crime has fallen in Austria and the clearance rate has increased, ""criminal acts with and by strangers have increased. Therefore, measures must be taken that do justice to the need to create objective and subjective security - through legal measures for prevention and control , investigations, legal proceedings, deportations out of the country. It was therefore right that the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice jointly put together and presented a package of measures that meets this need. The motto must be: ‚ÄúLook, don‚Äôt look away.‚Äù It cannot be accepted that those who come to Austria to seek protection become criminal and violent here. This should be punished with all possible consequences, said Amon, for example detention pending deportation, the obligation to report, but also measures such as DNA samples for sexual crimes. It is also important to provide for necessary returns more comprehensively and professionally, the √ñVP security spokesman stated a target value of at least 50,000 removals outside the country in the period from 2016 to 2019. For this purpose, support for voluntary returns with staggered return assistance is now planned. ""The package of measures that our ministers have presented is well balanced and appropriate to the current, difficult situation. In this way we can increase the objective and subjective need for security in our society.

""Our Austrians are looking for work, but the funny Mr. Kurz wants to introduce a special support program for migrants in the labor market."" That is completely irresponsible. However, this approach also shows that the claim, passionately made by Red and Black for years, that Austria needs migration in order to keep its labor market competitive and to secure pensions, was nothing more than a cheap lie. Kurzen's plan fits perfectly with the demands of the leader of the young generation in the SP√ñ, Tina Tau√ü, who has called for migrants to be given preference when hiring in the public service. ‚ÄúThe two ‚Äúfuture hopes‚Äù of the SP√ñ and √ñVP are showing their true colors,‚Äù said Strache.

 At today's National Council meeting, FP√ñ federal party leader HC Strache described the budget presented by Finance Minister Pr√∂ll and the federal government with the words ""conceptless, unimaginative, hopeless."" It is a document of failure and a veritable oath of disclosure. Strache announced a constitutional challenge that the FP√ñ would secure together with the Freedom Party in Carinthia. Strache strongly criticized the federal government's approach to the so-called ""rescue packages"" for Greece, Ireland and the banks. He also pointed out that the FP√ñ had always warned against the introduction of the euro. ‚ÄúOur money for our citizens,‚Äù demanded the FP√ñ club chairman. The government, on the other hand, is purely lobbying banks, and Pr√∂ll lets his ""uncle by choice"", Raiffeisen boss Konrad, dictate what he has to do. ‚ÄúThe families will lose 1.274 billion euros over the next four years. In total, Austrians will have to pay an additional 7.067 billion euros in taxes over the next four years,‚Äù said the FP√ñ leader. The CO2 surcharge for mineral oil tax alone amounts to almost 2 billion euros during this period. And the Austrians are also siphoning off over 300 million euros when they pay air tickets. If Pr√∂ll claims that this is a ""red-white-red"" budget, then that is a mockery of the colors of our flag, criticized Strache. It is a gag and a looting budget that robs families and the middle class of their breathing space. According to Strache, the alleged ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe single earner tax credit is particularly perfidious. This should not now be completely eliminated for couples where the children have already moved out, but should be retained for pensioners up to an income just below the compensation allowance. ‚ÄúThe effect on pensioners is zero,‚Äù explained Strache. ""The limit is set in such a way that the deductible amount is just under the compensatory allowance that is due anyway. With this so-called ""improvement"" you are making a mockery of 100,000 pensioner couples."" But that is just the financial policy of the √ñVP brand. ‚ÄúThe √ñVP has been in government without interruption since 1987. During this time, additional debts amounting to 134.4 billion euros were accumulated,‚Äù clarified Strache. In addition, there are the financial liabilities of the federal government's outsourced companies, i.e. rail, road and real estate management, amounting to around 30 billion euros.

 FP√ñ National Council member and cultural spokesman Volker Reifenberger criticized the children's friends' commitment to a children's carnival without toy weapons. The invitation to today's Children's Friends Carnival Festival in Vienna City Hall says: ""No toy weapons!"". ""This hypocrisy of the social democratic children's friends must not go unchallenged, otherwise at some point it will change from the minority opinion of the 'good and better people' to the majority opinion. I am not calling for toy weapons in children's carnival, but I am clearly against a ban on them. The parents and children should be able to decide for themselves! This is an expression of a liberal society in contrast to the left-wing ban culture,"" commented Reifenberger. ""What would a children's carnival be without cowboys and Indians, without police officers or sheriffs, without pirates, without knights, without Batman or without Jedi Knights? These costumes are very popular with children, especially boys. But these costumes do not have toy weapons meaningless and unimaginable. Of course, the toy weapons shouldn't be dangerous. And if the cowboy has to hand over his revolver at the cloakroom, he'll just point his bare finger in the direction of the Indians and shout ""Bang.""

13479.0," Government links vote on gun pass for police officers to ‚Äúgay marriage‚Äù in a law:_x000D_
 FP√ñ National Council member Christian Lausch and the federal chairman of the AUF, FP√ñ Federal Councilor Werner Herbert, were annoyed by a bizarre mixing of completely different matters in a joint vote in parliament. At yesterday's National Council meeting, a government proposal (Deregulation and Adjustment Act 2016 - Interior) was voted on, which contains completely different legal matters (gun passes for police officers, civil marriages of gay couples, recognition of star children). ‚ÄúNot only are apples and pears mixed here, but the mixing of completely unrelated legal provisions in a single common amending law also apparently enables a decision to be made that would certainly not have been possible if the individual legal provisions had been voted on separately. ‚ÄúThis is a democratically questionable and completely inadmissible approach that makes it completely impossible for MPs to make free individual parliamentary decisions,‚Äù they both noted critically. The FP√ñ unreservedly supports the possibility for police officers to be able to carry firearms privately and also have a legal right to a gun pass. The FP√ñ therefore approved the weapons law in the National Council's Interior Committee and in the National Council meeting on December 14, 2016 in the second reading, as separate voting on the individual pieces of the law was possible. In the third reading, the entire body of legislation can either be approved or rejected. This government proposal also provides for equal treatment of gay marriages with traditional marriages, in the form of a shift towards registry offices, a socio-political change that is unacceptable for the FP√ñ. ‚ÄúBut since both provisions were contained in one law, our only option was to reject this government proposal, even though we supported the section of the weapons law twice,‚Äù emphasized Lausch. As a result, the Greens, opponents of the police, will have to vote against gay marriage, Lausch continued. The FP√ñ and AUF see an obvious lack of trust within the coalition partners SP√ñ and √ñVP behind the bizarre approach: ""Obviously there is horse-trading by the governing parties behind the mandatory joint vote. Apparently the SP√ñ and √ñVP have to put gay marriage on the same level as security for our population and the executive in order to find majorities within the coalition. The fact that completely different, independent legal matters and mutual demands can no longer be voted on separately shows that the SP√ñ is afraid of being ripped off by its government partner in parliamentary votes and √ñVP must be justified and significant,"" said Werner Herbert.

 The liberal National Council member and district party chairman of the FP√ñ M√∂dling, Ing. Christian H√∂bart, today criticized the planned Islamist congress on March 10th in V√∂sendorf in a hall of the ‚ÄúEfsane D√ºg√ºn Salonu‚Äù association. The room holds around 1500 people and is usually used for Turkish weddings. ""The radical Islamist organization ""Hizb ut-Tahrir"" is planning the first Austrian caliphate conference on March 10th in V√∂sendorf. This organization consists of Stone Age Islamists who, for example, want to replace European forms of government with an Islamist caliphate state based on Sharia! These people have nothing to do with the democratic principles of the Republic of Austria and have absolutely nothing to do here,"" said H√∂bart. The local party chairman of the FP√ñ V√∂sendorf, Thomas Fasching, is also horrified by the planned event in his home community: ""It's not enough that this organization represents a form of Islam that contradicts all liberal values, the Federal Republic of Germany already has the organizing organization banned in 2003 because it works against international understanding and advocates political violence. It is simply a scandal that such an organization is allowed to hold a conference calling for the abolition of democracy and the formation of an Islamist theocracy Carnival. ""The FP√ñ, as Andreas M√∂lzer, one of the FP√ñ pioneers, repeatedly emphasizes, respects moderate Islam as one of the monotheistic world religions. But Stone Age Islamists have no place in Austria. Organizations such as ""Hizb ut-Tahrir"" also belong to , which threaten democracy and our freedoms, must be banned as quickly as possible by the market town of V√∂sendorf and the BH M√∂dling must also consider legal action against the owner of the hall in V√∂sendorf, as there is obviously still one There is no operating permit for the hall itself,"" concluded H√∂bart and Fasching.

Construction of the nuclear power plant began in 1987, but construction work was stopped in 1991 due to a lack of money and massive safety concerns. In 2004, the Bulgarian government took the plans out of the drawers and continued building, despite a lack of funds and in the middle of an earthquake zone. After all, in 1977, more than 200 people died in the immediate vicinity of the nuclear power plant in an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6, according to Richter. The last time a 5.3 magnitude earthquake hit the region was in April 2009. ""Soviet scientists warned about the seismically problematic site as early as 1984 and the Bulgarian government at the time justified the construction freeze in the 1990s with the words 'technically unsafe and economically unfeasible.' It is therefore absolutely irresponsible that Energy Commissioner Oettinger seriously invested huge amounts of taxpayers' money ""We want to pump a project that endangers the health and lives of all of Central and Eastern Europe,"" said Obermayr.

 ""It is extremely gratifying that the German federal government now obviously wants to prevent the nonsensical plans for a uniform EU quota for women on supervisory boards.

Carmen Gartelgruber corresponding reports from the S√ºddeutsche Tageszeitung. Women's quotas would perpetuate the outdated image of women in need of help who cannot stand on their own two feet. ‚ÄúWe free women represent a completely different image of self-confident women who are ready to make their own decisions and take responsibility,‚Äù said Gartelgruber. It is therefore completely counterproductive to force women into certain positions. ""Perhaps our women's minister will at some point come to the realization that her policies have failed across the board both in Austria and in Europe and have not brought any real improvements for women,"" Gartelgruber criticizes women's minister Gabriele Heinisch-Hosek.

On the other hand, women who are in real need must be helped directly. ""Women's quotas on supervisory boards are irrelevant for both concerns.

 ""Hooray, it rhymes again!"" - With these words, FP√ñ chairman HC Strache presented the FP√ñ's second series of posters for the current National Council election campaign yesterday. The topic is the EU and the aid payments to countries like Greece, but also the uncompromising support of banks and speculators. And the FP√ñ continues to fight against asylum fraud, as can be seen in the current FP√ñ TV magazine. The race for the National Council election is entering its hot phase. But the fight for every vote is not only taking place on the streets, parties are also fishing for voters online. Social networks, especially Facebook, play an important role. No matter how hard politicians try to win the favor of users, only one person can really do it: HC Strache. FP√ñ-TV shows how he moves on Facebook. Housing is becoming more and more expensive and is no longer affordable for many people. A now 103-year-old war-disabled pensioner has to shell out almost 900 euros a month for her modest apartment. She has been waiting in vain for a council apartment for years. Because if the SP√ñ has its way, it will have to be patient for at least four more years. FP√ñ-TV reveals how hard the Faymann-SP√ñ is really fighting for affordable housing.

 ‚ÄúIt is scandalous how Kern and now Sobotka want to play the Austrians for fools and arbitrarily bend the statistics in order to continue to pursue a completely irresponsible policy of open gates for migrants from all over the world to the detriment of the Austrians.

But the Austrians are interested because they will pay the price for this policy - financially, in terms of security policy, socio-political and social policy.

Dr. Andreas Karlsb√∂ck, in view of the ‚Äúround table‚Äù on the problem of dental technicians convened by Health Minister St√∂ger. Many patients would switch to cheaper foreign countries because of the high deductibles for dental treatment, which increases the financial pressure on the professional group of dental technicians in the already bad economic times, says Karlsb√∂ck. A simple example explains the absurdity of the situation, Karlsb√∂ck explained: According to the collective agreement, a prosthesis costs around 760 euros. Half, i.e. 380 euros, is paid by the health insurance company, the other 380 euros must be paid by the patient himself. In eastern countries, the prosthesis costs exactly the same amount as the health insurance companies in Austria, i.e. 380 euros. The patient pays this amount on site, submits the bill to his health insurance company in Austria and receives back the amount he is responsible for according to the statutes, approximately 380 euros. ‚ÄúA classic socio-political outsourcing, in which hundreds of millions of euros in social security funds flow abroad. This promotes the foreign dental technology industry and the foreign economy,‚Äù criticized Karlsb√∂ck. Especially now in the economic crisis, many Austrians are no longer in a position to pay the anti-social punitive health taxes or deductibles, let alone raise the necessary funds for crowns and bridges, Karlsb√∂ck reported from practice. This problem is not even ignored by the social partners. ‚ÄúThis scandalous nonsense of socio-political outsourcing must be stopped,‚Äù said Karlsb√∂ck, who repeatedly called for the deductibles on necessary dental services to be abolished and for social security funds not to flow abroad. ‚ÄúThat would be active social, health and economic policy,‚Äù says Karlsb√∂ck, alluding to the current government retreat. Such measures would keep the money in Austria, tax revenue would increase, the domestic dental technology industry would be strengthened and additional jobs and training positions would be created, which are so urgently demanded by the Minister of Social Affairs. ‚ÄúIn times of scrapping bonuses and banking packages, there must also be money for the really weak in our society,‚Äù demanded Karlsb√∂ck, who pointed out that the FP√ñ has been calling for the anti-social deductibles in the healthcare system to be abolished for a long time.

Either Fekter does not represent Austria's interests in Brussels, or our government has nothing to say there and is at the mercy of the European banks, said Podgorschek.

34541.0," Thanks to Johanna Mikl-Leitner and her security policy line, which will be continued:_x000D_
 ‚ÄúWith Wolfgang Sobotka, Austria is getting an assertive interior minister who stands for security and political experience,‚Äù emphasizes √ñVP club chairman Dr. Reinhold Lopatka during his plenary speech today on the appointment of the new Federal Minister. Right now, Austria needs an assertive interior minister with management qualities ‚Äì at the European and national level. According to Lopatka, Sobotka will ‚Äúbring in all his experience and skills‚Äù and continue the security course set by Mag. Johanna Mikl-Leitner in the interests of the Austrians. Lopatka emphasizes: ‚ÄúHaving only been in office for just under a week, Wolfgang Sobotka has already gotten an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe situation in Tyrol and on the Burgenland border.‚Äù Sobotka knows the nine state governors ‚Äúand they know him.‚Äù This is of great importance because the cooperation between the Interior Minister and the state governors is ‚Äúan important axis for our security‚Äù. ‚ÄúWith Wolfgang Sobotka, a political professional has come to the federal government who doesn‚Äôt need any time to get used to it. He is already in the middle of hard work,‚Äù the √ñVP club chairman states. Austria and Europe are facing major security policy challenges due to the refugee crisis, a large number of simmering conflicts at the gates of Europe and the threat of Islamist terror. Being able to address these requires foresight, expertise and a high level of commitment. Lopatka:  _x000D__x000D_
‚ÄúAs Interior Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner brought exactly these qualities with her and accordingly pursued responsible policies in the interests of the security of our country and the Austrians. My special thanks go to her at this point!‚Äù In order to ensure the best possible protection for the population, she launched the initiative for the State Protection Act in spring 2014, which was passed in January ‚Äúand with which we give the security authorities the necessary instruments to fight against ‚ÄúWe have given terrorism, extremism and radicalism into our hands.‚Äù It was also Mikl-Leitner who warned early on about the increasingly difficult situation caused by the flow of refugees. ‚ÄúShe presented the ‚ÄòSave Lives‚Äô concept back then. She pushed for the necessary changes to the law in a timely manner,‚Äù explains Lopatka. It is their ideas that are currently being implemented at the European level: hot spots in the crisis areas or in the periphery, the involvement of the UNHCR or the distribution of people entitled to international protection across all member states using a fixed quota. Lopatka: ‚ÄúThis European solution is and remains our goal!‚Äù As long as such a solution is not implemented, ‚Äúwe have to take appropriate national steps. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing today with the asylum and security package.‚Äù The measures to be decided on - temporary asylum or restrictions on family reunification, an accelerated examination procedure, the redefinition of integration as a debt obligation and the possibility for the federal government to implement special provisions in asylum management by ordinance to maintain public order and protect internal security - set continues the security policy line taken by the √ñVP.  _x000D__x000D_
The newly put together security package also represents a clear commitment to security and the people in Austria. The government has decided to increase the police budget by one billion euros by 2020. In order to be able to respond to the threats of the 21st century, investments are being made, among other things, in IT and communication technologies as well as in additional personnel - specifically 2,000 new police officers. ‚ÄúSecurity in our country is worth a lot to us! We provide the necessary funds for this!‚Äù says Lopatka.

5446.0,"Who will punish the budget sinners France and Spain!?:_x000D_
 On the occasion of today's main committee on European Union affairs in the House of Representatives, the liberal members of the National Council were harshly critical of the blocking of 500 million euros from the EU Cohesion Fund. In advance, club chairman Heinz-Christian Strache stated that the Freedom Party would not tolerate the arbitrary acts of EU Commissioners Hahn and Rehn and that Chancellor Werner Faymann and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger would make it clear that Austria should not take part in the current smear comedy. ""While we are pumping billions into Greece and there is no end in sight to the so-called rescue, economic sanctions are being imposed on right-wing conservative Hungary using flimsy arguments. The EU's behavior against our neighboring state is simply a scandal,"" said Strache . As part of the negotiations in the EU main committee, the foreign and European policy spokesman for the FP√ñ, NAbg. Dr. Johannes H√ºbner, should draw the attention of both the Chancellor and his deputy to the fact that - apart from Greece and Portugal - many other EU states will also clearly miss the ""Maastricht criteria"" in 2012, even according to their own, less realistic forecasts (France 4.5%, Spain 4.4%). H√ºbner stated that there was never even any mention of sanctions. ""Hungary, on the other hand, which is planning a deficit of 2.9 percent for 2012, is being punished by 'freezing' cohesion payments. Political arbitrariness cannot be worse!"" said H√ºbner.  _x000D__x000D_
Therefore, H√ºbner submitted the following motion on behalf of the Freedom Party: ""The responsible members of the federal government are called upon to point out the obviously unjustified, partisan withdrawal of funding for Hungary by the EU Commission - specifically by Commissioners Rehn and Hahn - which violates the principle of equality ""We strongly condemn the need to take all necessary measures at European level, to refrain from the obviously arbitrary withdrawal of funding by the European Union to enforce political demands against the Hungarian government, and to immediately lift the block on funding."" As expected, the government parties voted together with the Greens against the liberal motion. ""It is striking that the EU Commission did not even consider sanctions against the regime of the post-communist Ferenc Gyurcsany. When the Hungarian people took to the streets in 2006 to mark the 50th anniversary of the anti-communist revolution in 1956, the socialist government did not the peaceful demonstrators - including children, women and the elderly - were brutally beaten.

2566.0," Lack of transparency is the guiding principle of this federal government:_x000D_
 The liberal budget spokesman NAbg criticized. Alois Gradauer in today's plenary debate on the planned transparency database. This so-called transparency database only causes high costs instead of providing a good overview of the Austrian welfare state and revealing where injustices and duplications exist. Since there are only inadequate agreements with the federal states, it is not even certain whether all data sets will be made available. ""Only the benefit recipient should have access to their data and be able to see what funding they receive. That's a joke and, at best, a non-transparent database. You really don't need to spend any money on that,"" says Gradauer. ""Intransparency is the leitmotif of this federal government. Whether with the Greek rescue package or currently with the aid to Ireland. The Austrian state assumes liabilities worth billions and the taxpayer has to pay for them. Finance Minister Pr√∂ll wants to make us know that liabilities don't cost anything. But that's not the case . The government is not telling us that the extensive aid for the weak EU states is leading to rising interest rates. According to chief analysts at RZB, there is a 1 to 1.5 percent interest disadvantage, which ultimately means additional interest costs for Austrian state schools "", says Gradauer. There is also a lack of transparency when it comes to clarifying who is to blame for the euro crisis and who is profiting.

Faymann throws around Austrian taxpayers' money as if it were his own, but which he probably looks after more carefully. The Chancellor is once again proving himself to be a pure Eurocrat and a willing accomplice of the Brussels centralists. In this context, Strache welcomed the Finance Minister's statements that there should be no extension of the deadline for Greece, but if the worst came to the worst, Fekter would still turn to Brussels, just like her party chairman Spindelegger recently, who immediately after a brief flash of courage was brought into line by Eurogroup boss Juncker. Debates about extensions of deadlines would miss the real core of the problem, Strache continued.

 The latest study by the Austrian Integration Fund shows that the Islamization of our country is well underway, said the liberal delegation leader in the European Parliament, Andreas M√∂lzer, today. ""From 2001 to 2009, the number of Muslims living in Austria increased by almost 200,000 to now around 515,000 people. And more than half of Austria's population growth during this period can be attributed to the increase in the Islamic population. These numbers say it all,"" says M√∂lzer continues. If this development continues, Islam will probably be the strongest religious community in Austria in a generation, stated the liberal EU mandate. ""While the native Austrians suffer from birth poverty, the Muslims have significantly higher birth rates. Therefore, in the future this development will be reflected even more strongly in the demographic composition of Austria than before,"" explained M√∂lzer. In addition, the liberal MEP pointed out what effects Turkey's accession to the EU would have on the population development of Austria as well as other member states of the European Union. ""If Turkey were admitted to the EU, there would be a risk of mass immigration to Europe, which would have huge consequences. Austria in particular, where a quarter of a million Turks already live, would be particularly affected by this,"" warned M√∂lzer.

""When 15 animal protection activists chain themselves to doors, the ORF on K√ºniglberg reports with images and sound. When 2,000 farmers express their concerns to the Federal President personally and peacefully, it is not worth a syllable to the ORF in Vienna,"" criticizes the √ñVP MP. Jakob Auer the unequal treatment in the media. Green parliamentarians attended both of the ‚Äúevents‚Äù mentioned. ‚ÄúIn Ried, the Green agricultural spokesman tried to calm the unsettled pig farmers. In Vienna, the Green animal welfare spokeswoman brings the activists coffee and cake to strengthen them,‚Äù Auer also points out ‚Äúthe hypocrisy with which party politics is being carried out here on the backs of the farmers.‚Äù ""The only party that has a clear stance on the issue and has also put forward a compromise proposal for a solution in the interests of the pig farmers is the People's Party,"" Auer finally demands information from Health Minister St√∂ger about the extent to which he is prepared to find a solution in this regard months of conflict that has been nerve-wracking for the industry. ‚ÄúPutting an entire economic sector in distress under the guise of animal protection should be reason enough for a minister to act,‚Äù the √ñVP MP expects legal certainty for pig farmers to finally be achieved.

13298.0," Mere excuse for a European solution for the importance of Austrian foreign policy is not enough:_x000D_
 During the debate in Parliament's EU main committee, BM Kurz explained that Austria alone had too little threat potential to effectively design or even conclude repatriation agreements. HC Strache explained that it was Kurz's job to vehemently use Austrian diplomacy in the countries from which most of the illegal immigrants in Austria come from. The excuse that only the EU can build up the necessary pressure with its development aid payments of 100 million euros cannot be used as an excuse. Strache calls on Kurz to live up to his departmental responsibilities and achieve necessary foreign policy successes for Austria. FP√ñ MP Walter Rosenkranz was particularly disturbed by BM Kurz's statement because he spoke of Austria's lack of threatening potential towards the countries of origin. ‚ÄúThe Austrian foreign policy of Leopold Figl and Bruno Kreisky achieved results even without ‚Äòthreats‚Äô ‚Äì with what? ‚Äì great successes. Kurz should become aware of this tradition and act accordingly.‚Äù It is also not enough for the Foreign Minister to insist that, on the one hand, it is not clear to the EU internally how Dublin regulations are implemented and that it would be better not to allow anyone to come to Austria anyway to let in. In his opinion, it would be easier not to let anyone in than to take someone out of the country. ‚ÄúThe question of border protection concerns the competences of the interior and defense ministers.

Although Almost a week and a half ago, as part of a discussion in the Social Committee of the National Council, the FP√ñ asked Anschober how the number of infections was developing after the first cases in the asylum seekers center in Vienna-Erdberg, and whether, in particular, the accommodation of asylum seekers for quarantine in If there was no urgent need for action at the Vienna trade fair, the Minister of Health downplayed the problem, which was obviously already known at the time, and pointed out that he did not want to give any fuel to the upcoming Vienna state and local council election campaign.

""But if you now read about the fact that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly again in Vienna-Inzersdorf, in Hagenbrunn and Floridsdorf, but also in a kindergarten in Vienna-Liesing, and the origin lies in asylum seekers or those entitled to asylum who work through temporary employment agencies were referred to the post office and other service providers as workers, then the starting point of this new coronavirus infection chain is also documented.

Head of delegation in the European Parliament, Andreas M√∂lzer, discussed the visa system of the Schengen countries during his speech to the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

 ‚ÄúBoth the FP√ñ delegation in the European Parliament and the federal party work well together with all of our EU partners. This very successful cooperation is based on unanimous decisions in all responsible committees of the FP√ñ and can therefore not be questioned."" This was stated today by Harald Vilimsky, FP√ñ General Secretary and head of delegation in the EU Parliament. With a party like the CSU, however, there is neither a commonality nor a desire for rapprochement. This supports the fatal welcome policy of German Chancellor Merkel and is positioned particularly to the left through her highest representative in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber. Weber is also head of the European People's Party group with Othmar Karas and Co and in this role is a driving force behind all the EU's nonsense. Weber always acts with particular malice against the FP√ñ and its partners. A rapprochement between the FP√ñ and the CSU seems absurd and will not happen, Vilimsky confirms: ‚ÄúWe would rather work with power women like Marine Le Pen and Frauke Petry than with FP√ñ haters like Manfred Weber.‚Äù How very successful they are international work of the FP√ñ is also reflected in the most recent developments. The FP√ñ also maintains excellent contacts with the USA and Russia, sometimes more than the established parties in Austria.

 ""The basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new medical training law, to keep more young doctors in the country, is honorable, but apart from that, the implementation is - as is unfortunately so often the case - botched,"" emphasized the liberal health spokeswoman and chairwoman of the parliamentary health committee, NAbg, today. Dr. Dagmar Belakowitsch-Jenewein. For example, financing issues are still completely open and teaching practice is not given enough time. The FP√ñ did not agree to the new law. Instead of just six months of teaching practice, one should have done everything right and introduced twelve months - in Germany it is even 24.

53659.0,"Report The chairman's report at the Social Democratic Congress 2016. (The spoken word applies) Dear friends, We are the main architect behind the Scandinavian welfare society. If we were to start over, we would reinvent it. We will fight for it when political opponents try to challenge solidarity and community. But we have not cast our society in concrete. And it is our responsibility to take the lead when problems need to be tackled and society needs to change. It is not good enough that there are still children who leave school without being able to read, write and count. It is not good enough when changing governments allocate money to, for example, the elderly - without the money actually going to our old people. It is not good enough that there are still major social problems. Because you know what? If you get sick, you don't have to worry about whether the staff at the hospital are too busy to take care of you. If you're going to a nursing home, you don't have to worry about whether you'll get decent treatment. We'll do that better. And here we need help. From pedagogues, school teachers, nurses, police officers, SOSU assistants, social workers. From all the public servants. All of you who have the privilege of being able to leave a unique mark on other people's lives and destinies .Be the difference between a good or bad day. Yes, be the difference between a good or bad life. For some it is of course just a job. But I am convinced that for most it is also a calling. A will to wanted something for other people. To use one's professionalism to make a difference. I am afraid if we are about to destroy the job satisfaction of some public employees. The conditions have become more difficult. A lot has been saved. Restructured again and again. But something is wrong. It's like the money is disappearing in too much paperwork. Sick leave is too high. It's unsustainable. Maybe we need a little revolution in the way we look at the public sector. It's not a financial burden .It is not something that by definition can be run better and more efficiently by the private sector. The public sector in Denmark is our darling. It is the one that has helped to create the conditions for one of the world's freest and most equal countries. And thank you for that! We need a new and united dream of what our welfare society should look like. A reform of the public sector. Where we focus on quality. Where we begin to measure results instead of means and processes. Where we, area by area, initiate de-bureaucratisation. The right management for our public sector is no longer New Public Management. We must create space for both professionalism and management. We politicians will simply have to interfere less. Both at Christiansborg. And out in the individual municipality and region. We must have a ""fingers-free"" reform. I would like your support today for the Social Democracy to take the lead in a major welfare reform that starts and ends with respect. For that individual person. For the individual employee. For our community. We have four goals. First, more tasks must be solved closer to the citizens. In recent years, virtually everything has been centralized. In many places it makes sense. Cancer treatment must of course be high specialized. It goes without saying. But much else can be solved locally. Here, digitization can lead us in new ways. I feel that if public employees can solve a task both smarter and cheaper in the future, then we should not let them keep a part of the profit in the individual kindergarten or at the individual school? I think so. drop the controls that are not to be used for anything anyway. More freedom for professionalism. We politicians must stick to the general guidelines. We need a stable framework with durable and multi-year budgets. a clear description of tasks and not always having to spend time on paperwork, then there will be room to create more results. Can private individuals contribute, so fine ‚Äì but only where it makes sense and always in a way where natural public monopolies remain public. Thirdly, it requires, first and foremost, that we focus on management. Good management ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãthis is the most important thing for the welfare society of the future, and for it to be more than a political dream. Management and goals are here to stay. We have an ambition to want something. And we have to know when we succeed and when we have to do something differently. But it has to happen without the kind of management we know today. There is a need for more direct management in everyday life. work. And finally, fourthly: More prevention. Less treatment. We spend far too much money and far too much time putting out fires - when the damage has happened. steps ‚Äì shifting resources to early intervention and prevention. must have changed. I know that decision-makers before me have said something of the same. It shows something about how difficult it is. And how true it is. Why is this going to be easy? No. But we can .Not all at once. And we will make mistakes along the way. There will be new demands for control and regulation. But let's try to stand against it. The goal is clear. That is also the premise. We do not have a public sector just to have a public sector. More tasks must be solved without a lot of new money. It is the person before the system. Never the opposite. The effort must be comparable across municipalities and regions. The less skilled must learn to death and pain from those who achieve the best results. Expectations are high . , who have their finger on the pulse. With the companies that benefit from a well-developed public sector. And in cooperation with decision-makers in municipalities and regions. Our goal is clear. More tasks must be solved closer to the citizens. We must enter into a welfare contract with our public employees. We must insist on a stronger focus on management. And we must invest more in prevention. This is a core task for a future S-led government. It requires that we at Christiansborg make the right decisions this autumn. When we are asked what the vision is for the next ten years, we answer: Strengthen welfare. More jobs. Invest in people. When liberal Denmark is asked, they say: The answer is top tax cuts! Top tax cuts! What was the question? The left says that we can only afford the future if those who earn the most get tax breaks - and if those who have the hardest jobs work more. It's a fake fiery platform. Maybe it's really more of a warm ministerial stool. And what's worse. It's not fair. Let me give an example. A man aged 43. He has no education. But he has been on the labor market for many years. at the same age - just with a long higher education. He turns 15. That's how great the injustice is still in our society. The difference in time is the difference between being there for the grandchild's first step and proudly being there for the first day of school. And for many is it also the difference between waking up in the morning and reaching for the glass of kodi magnyles - or waking up to a day with a full and energetic program. The inequality that exists in our society only increases as we get older. We must not enlarge it. We must fight it. And I allow myself to say it plainly: It is a mockery when the government's ""solution"" for those people is a senior flex scheme that benefits 100 people. It is a mockery. The left will have everyone work more. Not because everyone can. But to be able to give top tax relief. That is the wrong way to go. It is not the solution to Denmark's challenges. And challenges are there. When we look a little into the future, it is not difficult to see that the population is changing. We will more elderly people. That's great. But fewer young people. Fortunately, we can cure more diseases, but the costs go up at the same time. We have to solve that. And we can. But let me make it very clear. We are not going to promise gold and green forests. On the other hand, we do something else. We stick to our social model. We trust Denmark. And because we don't want to give big tax breaks, we can afford welfare. We can afford to create more jobs. We can afford so that more people can continue their education and upgrade their qualifications. That is our plan. That is our promise. Social democracy has shown throughout history that we are capable of governing and making decisions. Even those that are not easy. The decisions that We do it when it is the right thing to do. We have expanded the range of work. And we have always ensured consistency between income and expenditure. Economic responsibility and social progress have always gone hand in hand for us. do in the future. The foundation of our welfare society is workplaces. Private workplaces. Our prosperity is based on an enterprising business life and on diligent and skilled employees. In a tough global competition, framework conditions mean a lot. Therefore, we must always keep a watchful eye to ensure that we do not put Danish companies significantly worse than those they compete against outside the country's borders. The story of Denmark is the story of a small country that dared to believe that we were capable of to create something unique. Have the courage to take the lead. Just take the green transition. Denmark has gone from an economy based on coal, oil and gas. To a society that is based more on sun, wind and water. The vision is as beautiful as it has been maligned. Over the years, many have tried to slow it down or completely stop it. We have persevered. The results speak for themselves. Renewable energy is taking up more and more of our electricity supply. In a few more years than 80 percent. And when the rest of the world now needs new energy solutions, they naturally look to Denmark. That Denmark has a leading position in the green transition is not something that happened by itself. It is the result of a good business life and forward-looking energy companies. Combined with political courage, it has been a successful recipe. Now we have a government that is putting the green transition out of control. They want to drop the coastal turbines. Not because it is too expensive. But because the government thinks they are ugly. It does not benefit Danish companies. It does not benefit the environment and the climate. And it does not benefit the rural districts. We must instead stick to our ambitions. Especially because the requirements will not decrease in the future. The figures behind me clearly show our challenge .We are going to lack 70,000 people with skilled skills. imports a lot of labor from outside. For far too long we have accepted a globalization that benefits some more than others. It must end. Our task is to give everyone in our society the education, skills and knowledge that must to, so that they can manage on the labor market, support themselves - win in the fierce competition of globalization. That is our promise! We need better opportunities for training for the unemployed. Economy must not be a barrier. That is why we have proposed that unemployed people can take relevant training with 110 percent unemployment benefit. It is the right way to go. Actually, it is basically about security. Where in the old days it was safe to be able to stay at the same company for the whole working life, today it is not enough. No , today security is about being able to change. About knowing you are safe if the company moves out. That is our ambitious vision for the future of Denmark. Dear friends. credibility and trust. Let's be honest. As a party we have lost some trust over the past several years. Especially from those who have the most to lose in the times we live in. I meet many people who are very insecure about the future .People who experience fierce competition on the labor market. I understand that they are insecure. Because they are right: There are some who lose out from globalization. Inequality has increased. There are Danish wage earners who lose their jobs when the companies moving out. The free movement of labor does not put a lot of pressure on many at the top of our labor market. But I can promise you that they can feel it elsewhere. On the highway, in construction and in the restaurant industry. When people are insecure, it is our task to create security. Not by turning our backs on the world. Neither in rhetoric nor in action. The Social Democracy will never imagine that there are easy and simple solutions. But where the solutions are complicated, our message is simple: It matters first and last about honesty. We don't want to claim that time can be turned back. That development can be stopped. Because we don't want that either. We believe in the future. And we believe in a development where everyone is involved - and where no one is excluded. When parts of the labor market are pressured by new technology, so we want to ensure that Danish employees can master the latest technology. We cannot stand by globalization. It is fundamentally an advantage for Denmark, Danish companies and Danish employees. But we must not accept, that free movement becomes the same as social dumping. We have never made progress by looking back. There is only one way. And that is forward. But we will insist that everyone comes along every time we take a new step into the future. Everyone! As we have done before. Then we stop. We look over our shoulders. We make sure that everyone is involved. That is our promise. Denmark is part of Europe. We believe in common solutions .We know that we are only strong when we work together. This does not change the fact that large parts of Europe's population have recently made their position clear. The Danes voted no. The Dutch voted no. And the British voted no. And then it should be very simple. The EU train cannot just keep going. I said in December after the vote on the reservation of rights that we Danes do not meet the world with distrust. And I believe in the European project as much as I always have done. Throughout world history, no other political cooperation has done more to ensure peace. And no other cooperation than the European one has really been able to tackle cross-border problems. We just need to bring more common sense into the cooperation. We must focus the cooperation where it does the most good. We must secure the external borders. Ensure a fairer balance between the internal market, free movement and the rights of employees. Raise the requirements for our climate and environment. Fight cross-border crime. And then there is one thing I would like to use something extra time for it. part of the contract. It is our community that is at stake. The time of greed must end. We must fight tax havens. We must stand together to be able to finance our welfare society. It is very good with trade between the countries, but without welfare it will do no. Because if we only have a race to the bottom, where the European countries compete to have the lowest taxes and duties, then we will not be able to afford our welfare in the long run. I specifically propose that the social democratic parties in Europe join forces on a solidarity pact. I believe that the time has come to put a bottom under, for example, corporation tax. So that there will also be welfare in the future. I think all of this will give support to the European project. It is necessary. Because one thing is clear : The EU cannot simply continue without the people's trust. And we need strong binding cooperation in Europe. The Social Democrats are currently the Danes' favorite party. We are happy about that. We are proud of that. We want to be a party that represents the whole of Denmark. Many different people. From those where life is going well. And where the opportunities have increased. To those and to you, where life is sometimes tense. Where tomorrow feels uncertain. If we as a party are not able to represent ourselves everyone, then we give the right wing that privilege. Exactly as we see it around both Europe and the USA. It must not happen. To you, whose trust we have lost. We hope to win it back. We know we have to make us deserve it. And we will fight for that. We fight for a society with a strong cohesive force. Otherwise the bumble bee cannot fly. It requires something from all of us. That we contribute. That we take responsibility. For ourselves, for each other, for our society, for our democracy, for the world around us. We are a small country. We must be present in the world's focal points. And we are. We must help when people are sent to flee. We have always done that. We do that today. And we will do that in the future. Where we can help the most, and where we can help the most, is in the surrounding areas. Here we must do more. I can be worried about whether the world's attention will disappear now because there are no longer refugees on our motorways. That would be a failure of dimensions. That must not happen. At the same time, we face a big task ourselves. Many new Danes live good lives in Denmark .Because they can, because they want to, and because we as a society have given them the opportunity. have not learned Danish, even though they have lived here for many years. Who establish themselves in parallel societies. Far too many who are still not in work. The integration problems we face today have been created over several decades. It is not someone , we solve with the snap of a finger. We can instead start by ensuring that the problems do not grow even bigger. That is why we say that there is a limit to how many new foreigners we as a society can accept. I am glad that it is something that we broadly agree on in the Folketing. Does this mean that the Social Democrats will tighten just for the sake of tightening? No. This means that we will protect our social model and our cohesion first and last. often requires difficult decisions. And difficult dilemmas. We solve that task. We will also do that in the future. Immigration policy must be founded across the political middle. And it must have the support of the population. Because we want a society that hangs together. Far too many girls and women from minority backgrounds live bad lives. With social control. Without equality. Others are exposed to violence . Danish freedom is no longer for all of us. That is why I would like to make it absolutely clear: Social Democracy will always be on your side. In the showdown with a patriarchal and oppressive culture. In the fight to be allowed to find your own way in life. Your fight for freedom is our fight for freedom, and you must never doubt our solidarity. Dear friends. If the populism that often characterizes politics at home and abroad could be converted into energy, we would be free of fossil fuels already next year. there are no easy solutions. So we don't come with them. But our compass. We believe in that. There is room for developing welfare. For growth and for education. And we must ALL the time fight the injustices that are still in our society ; the mentally vulnerable who do not receive proper treatment, those who have been caught in one of the reforms, the far too many homeless people. The single mother who risks being put on the street because of an ill-conceived and antisocial allowance ceiling. We can not do it all at once. We solve the problems step by step. Is there one party in the Folketing that we can cooperate with on all this? most. When it comes to ambitious goals for our climate and environment. When it comes to improving conditions for those in our society who have the least. When it comes to investing in education and future generations. Children's rights and the fight against social dumping. When it comes to believing that tomorrow can be better than today - yes, we have a lot in common with the parties who, like us, want a different direction for Denmark. De Radikale. SF. Alternativet. Og Enhedslisten .Thank you for the cooperation. We can disagree about concrete policy. But we rarely disagree about the direction for a better Denmark. The Social Democrats have never been a bloc party. Denmark must not be ruled by a red bloc. Denmark must not be ruled by a blue bloc. We must do what we have always done. Cooperation. And whether it is in the country's municipalities or in Christiansborg, we can cooperate with all parties. I actually think that is what the population expects from us. Today I would like to send a greetings to the Danish People's Party: We obviously disagree about a lot. Both domestic and foreign policy. Nevertheless, we have managed to create results together. Like when we entered into a new and better unemployment benefit agreement a year ago. Like when you ended up supporting our opposition against the Liberal Party's attempt to introduce negative growth in the municipalities. Like the train fund that the Liberal Party is trying to kill off, but where we and a majority in the Folketinget insist that the whole country must stick together. But it was you who made Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen prime minister , and you continue to support him. You must stand up for that. The last time you went together with the blue parties and entered into a finance law for this year, the Liberal Alliance celebrated the tax cuts with champagne. That is the perspective of a collaboration with the blue bloc. I choose to trust you now when you say that you will not vote to lower the top tax. That is why I also believe that together we can enter into a 2025 agreement with the government. Where we prioritize money for welfare, growth and upskilling. Where we don't lower the top tax or ask worn-out Danes to work even longer. On those points, we strongly disagree with Venstre. But cooperation, we want that. Also about the difficult tasks here and now. That offer stands. to do, naturally depends on Lars L√∏kke. My call is clear: Let's enter into a broad agreement with the parties that want to take responsibility. Because you know what? If you have problems with steely eyes, then you need more of a ophthalmologist than a 2025 plan. When I became chairman of the Social Democrats, I gave Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen a promise. To be his partner when together we can create results that are right for Denmark. And to be his toughest opponent when he distorts Denmark and forgets to think about those who have the least. I have kept that promise. And I intend to keep doing it. Denmark does not need division. Neither between country and city nor between generations. And certainly not between people .In a world that is uncertain - and where the challenges are large and important - Denmark needs a strong and credible leadership of the country. Denmark needs a government that can mediate broad cooperation in Christiansborg and in society. Denmark has we need a government that puts the country's interests above its own. We are ready to take on that responsibility. The bumble bee flies. So does our society. And you know what? Together we can make it fly even higher. We believe on the future. We fight for justice. We trust Denmark. Thank you for the word.

54070.0," The Prime Minister has today called elections for the Folketing. Thus, the election campaign, which will hopefully secure Denmark a New Left-led government that can lead Denmark into the future, is now underway. Parliamentary elections are always about the future. But it's also about the road - the direction - Denmark must go. The election on 18 June will be between the current government, which is once again trying to pretend that everything is all good and bad. Faced with this, we in Venstre stand and say things as they are: Yes, things are getting better, but we are not at the goal. More difficult decisions must be made - otherwise Denmark will lose prosperity and welfare in the future. Denmark is a fantastic country. For the future it must be even better. And in Venstre we are ready to ensure growth, welfare and security for all of us. For us, the election is not about a fraction of a public budget of more than DKK 1,000 billion. And for us, the election is not about what has been done ‚Äì but what needs to be done. We are going to the election on our five special cases. These are five notable cases which - together with other areas of action - form the foundation for the political platform that the Liberal Party will pursue if the election leads to a civil majority: For the future, it must be possible to work. Lower the tax on small earned income Put a cap on the cash benefit For the future, we must have more private workplaces. Reintroduce the BoligJob scheme Lower taxes and fees for Danish companies For the future, Denmark must be opened up more to those who can and want to - but closed to those who don't want to. Fewer immigrants on public welfare Public benefits for refugees down to SU level Stricter rules for family reunification For the future we must be safe at home and on the streets. Foreign criminals must serve time in their home country More visible police Tougher course against foreign gangs For the future, a good healthcare system must be even better. New cancer plan with one patient-responsible doctor Introduce a treatment guarantee Other central political action areas and priorities Save billions in development aid and use them in Denmark The public sector must not be bigger. This is the hallmark of the Left. And that is the direction we will pursue if we recover the keys. In the Liberal Party, we have no doubt: Denmark is in the best position for the future with the Liberal Party in government.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases. We are therefore not talking about WHETHER there is climate change or whether we must contribute to combating the changes, but about HOW we can best d",no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text does not claim that state institutions irrationally favor a specific group.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases. We are therefore not talking about WHETHER there is climate change or whether we must contribute to combating the changes, but about HOW we can best d",no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The speech critiques and evaluates party performance without claiming state institutions irrationally favor a specific group.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases. We are therefore not talking about WHETHER there is climate change or whether we must contribute to combating the changes, but about HOW we can best d",no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text does not irrationally claim that state institutions favor a certain group.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

53936.0,"Dear everyone. Welcome to the Danish People's Party's 24th annual meeting. Once again here at the Congress Center in Herning. Thank you for showing up again this year in such large numbers. We are now looking forward to a few good days in each other's company. Where we will discuss the political challenges ‚Äì for our country but also for our party. But in addition to this, again this year we will remember to celebrate and rejoice over the many reunions, which an annual meeting is also an occasion for. But let me start in a completely different place .At home in my childhood town N√∏rre-Snede. Where I grew up. Was shaped and formed as a person. Learned to ride a bicycle. they were holding on to each side of the luggage carrier, it was going brilliantly, but the moment I looked back and they were standing there laughing far behind, I fell over with a crash. Or when we were going to the legendary town party - the Prairie Party - when there really was cowboys and Indians to. I had to be an Indian and help take the prairie town, which was defended by lots of cowboys. With Indian wig, tomahawk and wild screams, we tried to force the wooden fence around the prairie town. It must have been a sight for gods. Good thing there were no iPhones then and the whole thing was filmed... I was also hooked on football back then. And I both played and coached those who were younger than myself. And think - I could think of shouting; COME ON GUYS! to the boys on the field. Think how offensive I have acted... a long time before the University of Copenhagen came to our rescue and explained how we should address each other... For a long time I was a goalkeeper. And now I'm getting closer to where I want to be with this introduction! Because we had many good matches. And I have many good memories from that time. But I remember one match in particular very well. It was a match against Virklund at Silkeborg. Away from home. I can just as well say that as it was: We lost 27-1. And yes - I really remember - I was the goalkeeper. It wasn't exactly the coolest experience I've had. Because we came to Virklund with the belief in a reasonable result. We probably knew that they were good and it became difficult. But at the start of the match we had fought sensibly for it. But as the goals were scored, it became harder and harder to get us to fight - to believe in it. And in the end it took no time from the time we gave the ball up until they had scored again. I then bounced a little in the goal to try to instill some fighting spirit in the team in front of me, but it only helped a little. It was like watching a play. Or a slave dream. Completely unreal. The battle was lost. And we had got a real one on the nose. A huge ear of figs to drive home to N√∏rre Snede with. That feeling I remember from that time - I got it again on 5 June. After a long election campaign where every single day it was uphill. Where every single day we were told that the measurements were going down. Where every single day we were bombarded from all sides at once. Either by some who claimed they wanted to lead our policy or by others who belittled the results we had achieved. We have always shown that we would go back in relation to the fantastic result from 2015. But on top of that logic came an election campaign that was in every way different from 2015 .At that time the election campaign was characterized by a fight against the parallel societies. With imams who undermine Danish societal values. This time the focus was on daycare centers and pedagogues who were not up to their task. At that time the focus was on how we restored optimism in the proud Danish agricultural business. The aftermath of the financial crisis still spoke its clear language. This time the focus was ‚Äì to put it very mildly ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãon the climate and then all agricultural interests and all other business interests had to give way. And an election campaign in which our candidate for prime minister suddenly wanted a SV- government with the Radicals as support. Where did that leave our party? Many conditions made it a very different election campaign. And an election campaign that certainly did not take place on our terms. But these are external conditions that we might not be able to do much about. As the well-known former hunter-soldier B.S. Christiansen says in his lectures: Accept the given conditions - or at least live with them - and then do something about the things you can do something about. When you are sitting there in the trenches - in the middle of the war - the bullets are flying around your head - so tough it is not to get up in the trenches and start arguing that the war should be in a completely different place or should be fought in a different way. Then you simply shoot the bud off. No - you have to fight the battle while it is on , as best as you can - and then afterwards see what can and must be changed. Because like with the football match in Virklund by Silkeborg. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost 27-1. We could have played the match differently .We would have probably still lost, but had come away with a much smaller defeat and thus better opportunities to prepare the team for the next game the following weekend. As with the election result on June 5. I refuse to acknowledge that we should have lost then many mandates. we could have played the game differently. We had still lost mandates, but had had a bigger team to fight with in this election period than we have now. Because even if there are external frameworks that make the battle for us more difficult, there certainly also things that we must take with us and recognize that we have not done well enough. And that we must rectify so that we can get many of the lost voters back again. I began by welcoming our 24 . annual meeting. And when you have almost a quarter of a century behind you, it is necessary to have a proper evaluation of how we do things. What we have to do differently in the future. And with the election results in May and June, it is even more necessary, that we go about it thoroughly enough. Already on election night I announced that I would go around and discuss with the local associations what we should learn from the voters' message to us. And since the parliamentary group's summer meeting in Rebild at the beginning of August, I have had meetings with representatives for all our 98 local associations. It had been a real pleasure. It has not drained me of energy for political work ‚Äì it has given me extra energy. Because even though the starting point was probably poor, the meetings have given me extra faith in the party's willpower. Everywhere In Denmark, I have met you trusted people who have said to me: Kristian: We really want to be the party's ambassadors to the voters! But then you also have to dress properly so that we can be! And as one of our good people in northern Jutland said at one of the first meetings: ""There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something. Had we landed on a better result, it is not certain that you would have given up for such a basic evaluation as you are doing now. But now that it went the way it did, we can feel that you are taking it seriously."" And yes - I can promise you that, I - and we - do! Everywhere I have also met your trustees, who have said: We look too little at you. You must get around more and meet the members and the voters. And we have then laughed and joked a bit about the fact that it seems to be a much better starting point than at a time in another party, when trustees would rather see the chairman's heel than toe....No one mentioned - no one forgotten - I can't remember either , what is her name‚Ä¶..:) I have gathered a lot of good advice and comments from our meetings in recent weeks. About the election speech. Your assessments of why it went the way it did. And there are 4 things in particular that are mentioned again and again: 1. We should have ended up in government back in 2015. We ended up being seen as a party that is not prepared to take the ultimate responsibility by going into government. It is not good! The Danes want parties that are prepared to also take that responsibility. We should have pushed harder then ‚Äì we experienced a Liberal Party that wanted to go it alone and which was therefore not prepared to actually negotiate a basis for a government in which our special cases were included. But we accepted all too quickly that this was the case, and many Danes have therefore perceived it to mean that we were actually very comfortable outside. WE should have done more - but the Left would probably also have benefited from the fact that a wider government at the time. A V-DF government would have had over 40 percent of the Danes behind it. And bourgeois Denmark would have had a more stable government. We would of course still have had Anders Samuelsen's steely eyes to work with - but the starting point for to do so would have been different. So the issue of government participation is lesson no. 1.2. Our cooperation with the Social Democrats became too bombastic. It became too much the external statement rather than the political content. Many of you have emphasized that it is important that Danish The People's Party can collaborate politically with the Social Democrats. But the way it happened created too much doubt as to whether we consider ourselves a bourgeois party. And when we now see ourselves as a bourgeois party ‚Äì a nationally-minded party ‚Äì is It's crazy that our activism has been able to create such great doubt among Danes that many opted out of us in June. While we fought for political influence. Stopped the VLAK government's desire to raise the retirement age beyond what has already been decided. Got the tax reliefs turned away from the top tax and onto reliefs for people with lower incomes. Yes - then we didn't have sufficient vision for the doubts about our position that it created among many Danes. 3. The Marrakech agreement. Many of you would have liked to see , that we had blocked Denmark from signing that agreement. And many Danes have certainly found it difficult to understand that we could not convince Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen that he should not travel there - back then in December 2018. Although the rest of The Danish Parliament agreed that it should be signed, many of our compatriots think that a party with 21 percent support should have been able to prevent it. And ultimately we could also have prevented L√∏kke from signing. Perhaps Mette Frederiksen had done anyway, after a general election, but then at least we had drawn a line in the sand. And many of you would have preferred just that! 4. I mentioned earlier that many of you have told me that you really want to be the party's ambassadors to the Danes. But you have to be properly dressed for it. You simply have to know more about why we do what we do. We spent far too much time in the political engine room. The rush to get as much policy as possible implemented The tour also showed me that there is general recognition that we got many results through. But that we forgot to be told. Communicated. Not just to the voters, but also to you in the organization. So you had difficulty to explain what we did and why. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Finance Act for this year. scheme with a rate pool that has drained the national pension every year. Has increased the amount before offsetting work income by a total of DKK 100,000. To the benefit of pensioners with little income in addition to the pension. But the message to the outside world? It was a paltry DKK 17. And we have lost a great many voters because the pensioners thought they were being eaten up with virtually nothing. Or the example of the so-called paradigm shift. Several of you have said that you have looked up the word and that it has nothing to do with immigration policy. And that is right. The word paradigm shift describes a shift in thinking or a shift from one paradigm to another. A significant change in a perception or practice. And that is exactly what we want in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. That 9 out of 10 refugees and family reunified, who have historically stayed in Denmark, must be turned upside down: So 9 out of 10 instead return home to their home countries. But is that what the Danes hear when we use the word ""paradigm shift""? Or do many leave and go out and do a cup of coffee instead? Many things are agreed upon between politicians, civil servants and journalists. So when you say a word, everyone in the hallway at Christiansborg or in the negotiation room knows what it is about. That is why we talk about the thick walls ....So one thing I take with me from my tour is the need for a completely different and significantly strengthened communication within the party. This applies both in relation to elected representatives in city councils and regions, but also in relation to the organizationally elected in our boards. So that we can be each other's ambassadors for the good things that we get to implement or propose. So that we can enrich you with information - and you can listen to us and ensure that we get things said in a language that is understand! My tour has also confirmed to me that we have a great many people with extremely good skills in a wide range of different areas. Skills that we do not utilize very well today. So a different way of working must also ensure that we get to use the good minds we have in the membership. To the benefit of all of us. In the coming months, I will take various initiatives that will ensure a more direct dialogue in the party. Among other things, I envision a structure where there will be regular joint meetings among elected representatives from both parliament, region and city council. So there is a common thread in our political work, regardless of where it is. It should also strengthen us until the local elections in just 2 years. I also imagine a different involvement of you , who sit on local councils. I know that there is a big difference in what you want to participate with when you let yourself be elected to a local council. Some just want to help in the local area. But others want to discuss the national political development and on that way be a more active part in the development of our party. And we must gladly accept this wish and create the framework for how this can take place in practice. So there are some important tasks ahead of us. As a result of the good and constructive evaluation we have had. And within a short time, therefore, I will get back to you in the organization with more concrete proposals for how we organize ourselves differently, so that we can make better use of each other in the future. And yes: We must be faster and better at handling tedious cases, and yes: Peter and I must be less nice and sharper - even if our mothers have brought us up to be just nice and sociable. But when we meet unscrupulous opponents like Morten √òstergaard, Zenia Stampe and Pernille Skipper, we simply have to take the leaf out of our mouths and give them fight to the finish line. And you know what - dear friends! We listen and we act. The Danish People's Party MUST prosper again. We MUST win back the trust of the Danes. I would go so far as to say that we have a duty to do so. For Denmark's sake. For the future generations who will grow up in a safe country. We have achieved a lot in recent years. But there is SO much we have to do in the future. SO much our Denmark needs to be managed. Let me mention 8 concrete points: 1 In our Denmark, the immigration policy is under control. folk church. But a church for fewer and fewer. Our Christian cultural heritage is under pressure. So the immigration policy MUST be under control. Danish politics can be directly read in how many have come to Denmark as asylum seekers and family reunification. Our influence so far has meant that proportionally in 2050 there will be half as many people with a background in Muslim countries as there will be in our neighboring country Sweden .A completely decisive difference. But even if it is only half in Denmark of Sweden, it will still be a big challenge. And therefore we have two concrete proposals that we want to implement in the coming years. Firstly, we want to implement an actual asylum freeze .So you can no longer obtain asylum by showing up in Denmark yourself. It simply does not make sense that you can wander through one peaceful country after another in order to claim the right to asylum here in Denmark. So we have to put an end to! And when you can't get asylum directly in Denmark - I wonder how many will even apply here. It will be enough to overlook. With that we will save at least a few billion on the state's budgets until 2025. Money that can be spent on Danish welfare instead. Secondly, the repatriation policy must be implemented. We finally got it through with the Finance Act for this year, but that has not happened in practice. And with the new majority in the Folketing, we already see it eroded, so the question is whether it will come to anything at all in this election period. For example, the Radicals have won through that if you have worked here in Denmark as a refugee for two years, you must not return home, even if there has been peace in your home country. Then you have to stay here with the whole family. It simply does not work! If we are to ensure safety in Denmark for the future, it is not enough that fewer people come here. We also need many who are already here to return home .So we stick to the demand for an actual repatriation policy. And wasn't that also something that the Social Democrats gave the impression of agreeing with? That refugees should not be made into immigrants? Why are they giving in here? Maybe we will get answer during the weekend - the Social Democrats are holding a congress in Aalborg this weekend. But perhaps the answer will come to a greater extent from Nyborg, where the Radicals are holding a national convention. But the more cheers there about their regained influence on Danish politics, the more need for answer from Aalborg. We must also create greater fairness. So Danes do not feel they are paying a disproportionate amount to immigrants who have not helped to build society. That is why we are taking action against increasing costs for interpretation for foreigners. That is why we are calling out about the huge dental bills that are sent to Danish taxpayers due to dental care for refugees and migrants. That is why we say to the municipalities; now that we have removed the refugees' legal claim to permanent housing, shouldn't you also implement this in practice to the benefit of the Danes who have difficulty finding suitable housing? 2. In our Denmark, the Danes are masters of their own house. We have our self-determination as a nation ‚Äì as a people. We are a party that must fight to ensure Danish self-determination. We must give the EU and the ideas of increasingly centralized governance in Europe a fight to the finish line. Popularly speaking, we are for the old way of thinking about EC - but against the ever-increasing desire for federalism through the EU. We are against the EU as it has developed. But still, it is not relevant to have a debate about Denmark's membership of the EU. We can take it when there is a final status about the situation of the British and when we have seen for a while how it has developed. Until then, we must be the ones who vote for the opposition to the EU. Vote against an EU that wants to interfere in almost everything. Child check as we are forced to send to families in, for example, Eastern Europe. With a purchasing power that is completely insane and makes the Danish taxpayers ‚Äì the Danes who pay the fee ‚Äì laugh. Maternity rules ‚Äì where the EU will decide how maternity leave is shared between father and mother. Social services that EU citizens have access to from day one. A transport industry where there are fewer and fewer Danish drivers because they are undercut by foreign ones. Where social dumping is easy to play. An EU where Germany and France want a common defense and where they try to exploit an American president who is unpopular in the eyes of many to promote their ideas. A lot of things about the EU that are going the wrong way. And what will happen next? That the other parties want Denmark to join the banking union. And thus guarantee a three -digit number of billion kroner. We don't want that! And if a majority in the Folketing wants Denmark to join the banking union, it should only happen through a referendum. So we can test the population whether there is even a majority for it. And here can the chairman of the Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, adequately state whether she stands by what she said last November. Namely: ""I feel that if we go down the path called the Banking Union, I would think that the most natural thing is to ask the Danes. This is, of course, also seen in the light of the fact that we had a vote on the reservation in the legal area, to which the Danes said no."" Yes - exactly! The most natural thing would be to ask the Danes! I hope Mette - you stand by that promise! And then we must remember to point out that it is Margrethe Vestager and her group who are largely responsible for , that the EU is undermining our independence. Undermining our way of organizing the welfare society. Perhaps the Danes need to hear a little more about that? A little more public information about what the EU is actually interfering with - and a little less glorification of - wow - a Dane in a high position in the EU commission - is perhaps in its place. After all, these are the political decisions we will have to live with - even after Margrethe Vestager retires. 3. In our Denmark, it is safe to grow old. We want a society that protects about its elderly fellow citizens. And regardless of where in the country you live your life, you must be able to stay safely. Regardless of whether you live in your own home or need a place in a nursing home. There are still too many examples of conditions facing our elderly who are not ok. For example, elderly people who cannot go to a nursing home, even though the need is striking. Else Jensen from Helsing√∏r. 101 years old. Was refused a place in a nursing home three times. Osteoarthritis in knees, back and hands, diabetes. Despite daily visits from the municipality with help with hygiene , cleaning and food, she applied 3 times for a place in a care home, but was refused. Why was there no place in the care home in today's Denmark for the now sadly deceased Else Jensen? Or 91-year-old Hans Carl Christensen at 91. Who worked at a tire center, until he was 84 years old - that's why he only got his public pension there. Was found on the floor of his home dehydrated and slept in the hospital later that day. He had also asked several times for permission to go to a nursing home. A lot of elderly people - who are have come of age and really lack security - looking in vain for a place in a care home. To be able to spend the last years in a framework that creates as much peace and security as possible. We as a society must be able to do better. That is why we put forward a proposal that elderly people who pass the age of 80 must have a legal claim to a nursing home place. We are completely convinced that elderly people only want to go to a nursing home when you can really feel that it is necessary. So others parties' ridicule of the proposal - that now everyone over 80 will demand a place in a nursing home, they may as well pack up. Conversely, when you as an elderly person can feel that a place in a nursing home is now necessary, we should also be able to help as a society. As we should have helped Hans Carl Christensen on 91 otherwise Else Jensen on 101.4. In our Denmark we have the best healthcare system. And it is close to all of us. I clearly remember my visit to the emergency vehicle in Lemvig. When the alarm went off, I was allowed to drive to a citizen in Harbo√∏re. Within a very short time we were there - saw both an ambulance and the emergency vehicle was present. The citizen immediately received help that was almost equivalent to rolling a small hospital into the home. Skilled people in our healthcare system - with quick intervention - who created security for both the patient and the family. But the emergency vehicle in Lemvig is only came about as a result of political pressure. Just like the other emergency services around the country. But for us it is important that our health service is close by - regardless of where you live. When we made the proposal for health reform in the spring, all attention was directed to the future of the Regional Councils. It was a pity. Because the most important things in the proposal for health reform were not about the politicians in the regional councils at all. They were about the patients. About how more of the help for the patient can come closer to people's places of residence. Billions were proposed to be prioritized for more emergency preparedness like the one in Lemvig. To health centers in the municipalities. From which older patients and chronic patients in particular could benefit. Too many Danes have gone much longer to the specialized hospital, which is supposed to help when it's really on fire. In return, there should be shorter distances to everything that does not need to be in a specialized hospital. It is my hope that the majority of the health reform can be carried out. To the benefit of the patients. Regardless of whether the majority wants there to continue to be 5 regions with politicians and civil servants to serve the politicians. But in our healthcare system we go further than that. We want, among other things, a change in the terms of dental treatment. age group refrain from going to the dentist and this affects the quality of life later in life. We also want greater help for the pensioners who have large dental bills. should help solve. 5. In our Denmark there is balance. We must ensure that there is a basis for growth and development in ALL of Denmark. But we must do it in a way so that we can stop that war - or frenzy - that is between the parts of the country. It is simply not worthy that we in Denmark cannot have that debate without it becoming a battle between different parts of the country. That is why we must work for a completely new model for economic equalization. The current one is there is no one who can explain. And when it cannot be explained, it cannot be defended either. The municipalities that are to be helped do not feel that they are getting enough help. And the municipalities that have to pay feel that they are paying so much that they are unreasonably cut down on the service to their citizens. So everyone is dissatisfied and is increasingly scolding each other. We should create a model where it is not the municipalities that have to pay each other. Where we as citizens pay a more equal percentage of our income for our common welfare society. Where the municipalities then get their share of the welfare cake calculated in relation to their inhabitants. With the goal that everyone - regardless of where we live in Denmark - can get more or less the same basic service. So regardless of where you have to have care your child, regardless of which part of Denmark you have to go to school in. Regardless of where you get old. Then you can do it with the security that there is a basic public service that is in order. That you don't have to move, for example municipality to get proper care for the elderly. It is an economic system we know from the way we finance the hospital system. Where we want to ensure that you can get the same help from the health system, whether you fall ill in Frederikshavn or in Frederiksberg .Our Denmark is also a Denmark where the capital is happy and proud to be the capital of Denmark. And where the vision for our biggest cities does not have to be that they should get bigger and bigger. But where the focus is instead on the quality of life for the people who already live in the big city. Where the pollution and congestion problems are not made worse by the fact that tens of thousands ‚Äì perhaps even hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more have to be crammed into the big cities. If we can ensure that more people find their way to the good life outside the big cities, we ensure also a greater quality of life for those who live in our largest cities. Then there will also be room for more oases and green areas in the cities. Big cities around the world have had enough of the eternal flow of more and more people and have focused on, that those who actually have to have a coherent life in the big city can also do so. We have not reached that point in Denmark yet, but it can also be nice to prevent the problems rather than first doing something when the problems, in the literal sense, are We can do something by, for example, ensuring that education places are sufficiently distributed across the country. That is why we propose that at least 10 percent of higher education places must be outside the four largest cities. This will give approx. a doubling of the places outside the four largest cities compared to today. The plan must also ensure that at least half of the education places at the vocational academies and vocational colleges are outside the four largest cities. Because one can ask yourself why today we say to our young people, that while you are being educated, you must live in the most expensive places in our country. Why not instead provide better educational opportunities elsewhere in the country? We can also do something by securing better loan opportunities for both business and housing. Today, entrepreneurs in rural areas are often refused loans ‚Äì just because they are located in a rural area. And young people cannot get a mortgage, but are forced to take out a more expensive bank loan. This hinders development in rural areas. wrong. It simply does not work. That is why we propose that a model be created in which the state cooperates with the banks and mortgage credit institutions - finds a distribution key in relation to the risk - so that banks and mortgage banks will lend again. It is not right that are areas in our country that are being depopulated - not because people don't want to live there, but because we have screwed up some excessively square rules after the financial crisis 10 years ago. For us in DF, a balanced Denmark is also about them, who are not on the bandwagon. The vulnerable, the unemployed, those who feel like they are thrown from job trial to job trial via the job centre. We must become better at helping those who have scars on their souls. Psychological, mental problems. Instead of many people's feeling that the system actually makes them sicker. We must do more for the downtrodden. we do more to help the worn-out to be retrained. There are many who would rather that than simply leave the labor market. And then there is the question of Arne? How long does Arne have to wait before he has to see the Social Democratic Party's proposal for earlier public pension. Dear Mette up in Aalborg: Perhaps today you want to lift the veil on whether Arne is covered by your new model? Is it the bricklayer, is it the carpenter, is it the hairdresser? Many of us are excited. And if you want the Danish People's Party's support to implement a model for earlier state pensions for some selected groups, is it reasonable that we - and the Danes in general - must see who the groups are? And how you have come to select exactly them over others...? So to the Social Democrats: Put your cards in the open. Stop playing it safe! 6. In our Denmark, we take climate and the environment into account. We have printed completely new copies of our climate policy in the run-up to the annual meeting today. Either you have already received a copy - otherwise you will get this during the break. We state the obvious: That there is both man-made climate change AND climate change, which will come regardless of what we do. We want to reduce man-made climate change as much as possible. That is why we fully involved in the gradual transition of our heat and energy supply to increasingly renewable energy, which is also reflected in our adherence to a large number of agreements in recent years. We want Denmark to live up to the international agreements we have undertaken in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

54059.0," But if they say that about the year 2014, you have to give the two gentlemen the right. It has been a wild year in Danish politics. Who can soon remember that the year started with the Socialist People's Party leaving the government? Allegedly in protest against the sale of DONG, which the majority of the parliamentary group subsequently voted for anyway. Who can soon remember the number of people who fled from the Socialist People's Party's ministerial ranks and parliamentary group? When Astrid Krag could neither become chairman of SF nor remain as minister, she slipped away. And the former chairman of the communists, Ole Sohn, also believed that he was a social democrat like the former SF comedian Jesper Petersen, while Ida Auken went her own way and signed up under the banner of the Radical Left? Yes, it almost feels like it's been years <U+0096> not just barely 12 months. The Socialist People's Party's exit from the government then gave rise to the 7th government reshuffle, but as is known, two more were to follow, which means that the Helle Thorning-Schmidt government has set a Danish record for government reshuffles. No less than nine different lineups over the past 3¬Ω years. So many different team lineups are usually a sign that things are not going too well and that is probably also a fair conclusion! Very symptomatic of a government whose common thread you have to be more than usually well versed in Danish politics to be able to keep track of. Here towards the end of the year, it has been close to impossible to find out when government ministers speak on behalf of the government and when they put on the party glasses. As you know, Margrete Vestager ended up as competition commissioner <U+0096> a boring exchange compared to the post of president of the EU, which Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was close to, but for which she was otherwise not officially a candidate. Rumors from Brussels are otherwise that Helle Thorning-Schmidt was in the running for president almost until the vote took place. However, the arrow ended up pointing at Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk instead. It is impossible to say whether it was the disappointment of being sacked as EU president or the many government reshuffles that were the reason, but the Thorning government has seemed strangely paralyzed since the summer holidays. When the government has chosen to play with its muscles, it has been by sitting a majority in the Folketing on no to child checks for EU citizens and the future of the radio entertainment orchestra overheard. Completely unheard of! When rumors spread that the Prime Minister would use the opening speech in October to call a referendum on the reservation of rights, many of us imagined that it was the government's attempt to go on the offensive. But it also resulted in nothing more than a cold-hearted reduction of a commission and handing over a matter of duty to the next Prime Minister's desk in the form of an agreement to call a referendum on the reservation no later than the first quarter of 2016. Nor did the government dare a vote on the reservation of rights so connect with. Nor has the Thorning-Schmidt government managed to handle immigration policy. The government's many relaxations of immigration policy led to a massive flow of asylum seekers in the summer and autumn <U+0096> and the only thing the government could agree to put forward as protection was a proposal to postpone the right to family reunification by &eacute year. As if anyone believes that the Syrians will be sent home next year. But even this microscopic tightening was, as you know, too tough a diet for the Radical Left, who avoided the proposal as recently as last week. And yes ‚Äì of course it cannot be avoided! 2014 also featured the Danish People's Party's biggest voter success to date. In the European Parliament elections on 25 May 2014, the Danish People's Party got 26.6 per cent. of the votes and incredibly elected 4 (!) members to the European Parliament. Morten Messerschmidt was an excellent front-runner for the Danish People's Party, and he led the Danes' showdown against the increasingly pervasive European behemoth in Brussels and Strasbourg. It is a result that will stand as the culmination of a very good year for the Danish People's Party. A year in which I and many other representatives of the Danish People's Party have felt a fantastically positive atmosphere around our party when we have traveled around the country. But as I have said many times in the past year. It is not the snapshot that the opinion polls express that matters. This is how voters actually vote when they stand at the polling booth. It will determine with what force we speak after the general election that awaits in 2015. The day after tomorrow is Christmas Eve and I think we should use the coming days to put politics aside for a bit. Enjoy the Christmas message with family and friends! And then gather strength for the election year that awaits, when Christmas and the New Year's party and the first few days of January are hopefully well over.

53631.0," Folkem√∏det Helle Thorning-Schmidt spoke at the Folkem√∏det on 12 June 2015. Dear everyone, How wonderful it is to be back on Bornholm. It is good to feel the lively atmosphere of the Folkem√∏det again. I have been with Folkem√∏det since it started. From that, a small experiment was initiated by local zealots. Until today, when it is a huge success that all of Denmark gathers around. Thank you to the many Bornholmers who have been involved in this year's event. Thank you to the citizens of Allinge for showing patience with us guests. We are becoming more and more. But you have hopefully gotten used to us. Because we will come again next year. Thank you to all those who came to Bornholm to participate in the political debate. And a big thank you to Winni Grosb√∏ll for hosting us all. This year it's shaking even more than usual. It is the first time that the Folkem√∏det is held in the middle of an election campaign. That does not make the People's Meeting any less interesting. On the contrary. Now I also have to confess that the general election did not completely get behind me. I am convinced that it is good that, in a time when there is gradually a DR or TV2 channel for every single Dane, there is still room for classic political debate. Not everything in the world can be experienced on an iPad. I think it is healthy that we politicians insist that the spoken word applies. So I have been looking forward to the Folkem√∏det this year. Especially because the circumstances are different this year. The election is about us wanting to preserve the Denmark we know. Or whether we have to go down an unknown path with zero growth and questionable tax cuts. The election is about how we ensure growth and jobs in Denmark while preserving our community and the Denmark that so many of us hold dear. It is about how we preserve our solidarity welfare society in a time when a lot is changing. In recent years, Denmark has gone through a severe financial and economic crisis. The worst crisis since World War II. It blew a hole in our common prosperity. It was bad. We were hit harder than other countries because good times were spent badly. That's why we started with a long tough move. Tax reform. Growth packages. Record high public investments. A lift from the primary school. Reform of SU and cash assistance. Early retirement and flexible work. A new vocational education. If there was a problem, yes, we had a reform. But we have taken responsibility. We are social democrats. There have been a bump or two in the road. Not all decisions have been equally popular. But has it been worth the price? My answer is a resounding yes. Today, Denmark stands in a new place. Most people agree on that - except the bourgeois. They are busy talking Denmark down. Maybe it's because they don't know the right context. Even the best can fail a fact check. Maybe it's because they'd rather forget what it was like. Because the reality is that the bourgeois government brought Denmark under tighter financial supervision in the EU. The social democratic led government has got us out. Before, budgets were something that was talked about. Now it's something we keep. Before, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen lost over 100,000 private jobs. Now unemployment is the lowest in five years. Denmark lost five percent of our prosperity. We have now had growth for seven quarters in a row. It is the first time in 15 years that this has happened. The bourgeois led Denmark into a historically severe crisis. And a social democratic led government got us free. Dear friends. We are out of the crisis. Denmark is back on track. I am satisfied with our results. We have solved the task we set. But what I am most proud of is that we have held each other's hands. We have taken responsibility together. Now we have to make a decision about what we want with Denmark. The Social Democrats will stay the course. Create jobs. We want to use the recovery to get all of Denmark involved. We will use the recovery to get everyone involved. To get the specialist worker up-qualified. To get those furthest away from working life into jobs. We want to invest in our common future. In our community. Do you know what the Liberal Party will use the upcoming recovery for? I have to tell you. The Left wants to use the better times to cut cash benefits. But listen now. Is there anyone who would exchange a working life for a life on cash assistance. I do not think so. The Liberals have created massive uncertainty among cash assistance recipients. But also among early pensioners and people on sickness benefits. And others who depend on the community. Why are you in such a hurry to prey on people who are already having a hard time? Left and Lars L√∏kke. It's too small. This is not how it should be in Denmark. Now we are out of the crisis. And we have shown what we are made of - when we stand together. Not even the worst crisis can crack our community. That is why it is so important that we hold on. When I get around the country, I talk to a lot of people. And although the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening and Venstre probably have figures that show otherwise, the majority of those I have met are Danes. Everywhere I meet a sincere desire for us to preserve the basic solidarity which binds our welfare society together and which sits deep within all of us. A welfare society where we have equal opportunities for everyone. That is why we must continue to invest in education. Never has any government spent as much money on education as we do today. A Denmark where you don't have to pay to go to the doctor. And where we do not gild the private hospitals at the expense of the public ones. That is why today we have 7,000 more employees in our healthcare system. We have record low waiting lists. People with mental illnesses have the same rights as other sick people. End discrimination. We must have a Denmark where it pays to work. And that is why an LO wage earner family has more for itself today than under the bourgeois government. 250,000 Danes have been lifted out of the top tax. And a single breadwinner has almost tripled his employment allowance. It is a lot of money. In short: It pays better to work today than when Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen was prime minister. We must have a Denmark where our elderly are cared for. That is why we have increased the senior citizen's check for the elderly who have the least. And we have targeted one billion kroner per year for the elderly who are most in need of help. We must have a green Denmark in balance. That is why we have the world's most ambitious climate goals. That is why we have a plan for more coherent nature. We must have a Denmark where we invest in the future of our young people. That is why our school children have several lessons in Danish and mathematics. That is why we have ensured more quality in vocational training. That is why we have never spent more money on education than we do today. And therefore we must have better standards for our youngest children. We must have a safe Denmark. That is why we have increased the punishment for gang-related crime. We have set aside one billion kroner to fight terrorism. We have set money aside for the police. We must have a Denmark where companies thrive, so that they create prosperity and jobs. And that is why we have implemented growth packages, which mean that Danish companies have become more competitive. Solidarity. Orderliness. Space for the individual. Opportunities for everyone. Strong economy. Reassurance. These are values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the Social Democrats have always stood for. It is not unnecessarily complicated. That's enough. And that is why I love the Denmark we all know so much. Can we stick to it? My answer is yes. But it requires us to choose it and to keep making decisions. Even the difficult ones. Dear everyone. There is a debate which occupies many Danes. It also occupies me. It is the issue of refugees and asylum seekers. And it has filled a lot in the election campaign. I think that is completely natural. But I would also like to say to the many thousands of Danish Muslims who go to work every day, who take an education, who contribute, you are part of Denmark. And we need you. We are a whole country. You are part of Denmark. But we are also a small country. We have always welcomed those who came either to work or because they were on the run. We also do that today. But it also makes demands when many people come at once. Because we don't want parallel societies. We don't want people sitting behind rolled-down curtains. My position is clear. If you come to Denmark, you must support yourself. You have to work. You must contribute. All over Denmark, the municipalities are making a huge effort to make this happen. So do thousands of volunteers. That's how it should be in Denmark. But we must also be able to keep up. Because otherwise it won't work. Neither for the refugees who come to Denmark. Or for the local communities. That is why the government, led by the Social Democrats, has made the first tightening of the asylum rules in 12 years. It is both proper and reasonable. At the same time, we suggest that refugees who come to Denmark should not sit and wait passively. They must contribute to Danish society. If there is a job, they must take it. Or they have to be in useful jobs. And they need to start quickly. Nothing is gained by them not starting to contribute to our community as soon as possible. That is the position of the Social Democrats. That is my position. The left is trying to make it sound as if all the refugees have been invited to Denmark by me. They have thrown so many numbers into the debate that they have tripped over them themselves. And it's not a pretty sight. Leave it. The reality is that there have not been more refugees in the world since World War II. The war in Syria. A Libya in disintegration. I have the utmost respect for my political opponent. I recognize his abilities. But peace in Syria and stability in Africa. Even for Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, it is a big mouthful. The bottom line is that the same number of asylum seekers would have come to Denmark if Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen had been prime minister. Don't let the Danes imagine something else. We now face a double challenge. We must be able to keep up. That is why we are tightening the rules. And we must ensure that the people who come to Denmark do not end up as clients. We are a small country. And I believe that this is a task that we can best solve together. And there are two parties that should go ahead. It is the Liberals and the Social Democrats. We are different parties. But both parties also know that foreigners are not to blame for all our problems. Just as we know that not all problems can be solved by foreigners. Yesterday, the Social Democrats presented very concrete proposals for greater requirements for refugees and foreigners to contribute. The Liberals think they have some proposals to tighten the asylum rules. It must be possible to find a common path. We must ensure that we can keep up. That we make the right demands. And where we do not expose the Danish labor market to massive social dumping. The Social Democrats have shown the will to search towards the middle. We have shown that we can create results. We are not ruled by one wing or the other. We do what is best for Denmark. If the Danes give me a new mandate, it will be my goal to get a broad political agreement on Danish immigration and asylum policy. There are no easy solutions. But there are solutions. And we must find them together. Yesterday, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen rejected the need for a broad political agreement. Either he won't. Or he must not. It speaks for itself. Dear everyone. In a week, the votes will be counted. Then the Danes have chosen. It is a decisive choice for Denmark. Between zero growth as far as the eye can see and questionable tax cuts or a safe path for Denmark, where every year we invest a little more in our welfare. Between an experiment that bristles in all directions or a stable economic course that creates growth, jobs and results. Between a new round of bloc politics or that we become even better at cooperating over the middle. And yes, the choice is also between whether it will be Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen or me who will be prime minister in Denmark. The choice is the Danes'. The Social Democrats are prepared to take responsibility. It is now that we must hold on to the Denmark we know.

We are different parties. But both parties also know that foreigners are not to blame for all our problems. Just as we know that not all problems can be solved by foreigners. Yesterday, the Social Democrats presented very concrete proposals for greater requirements for refugees and foreigners to contribute. The Liberals think they have some proposals to tighten the asylum rules. It must be possible to find a common path. We must ensure that we can keep up. That we make the right demands. And where we do not expose the Danish labor market to massive social dumping. The Social Democrats have shown the will to search towards the middle. We have shown that we can create results. We are not ruled by one wing or the other. We do what is best for Denmark. If the Danes give me a new mandate, it will be my goal to get a broad political agreement on Danish immigration and asylum policy. There are no easy solutions. But there are solutions. And we must find them together. Yesterday, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen rejected the need for a broad political agreement. Either he won't. Or he must not. It speaks for itself. Dear everyone. In a week, the votes will be counted. Then the Danes have chosen. It is a decisive choice for Denmark. Between zero growth as far as the eye can see and questionable tax cuts or a safe path for Denmark, where every year we invest a little more in our welfare. Between an experiment that bristles in all directions or a stable economic course that creates growth, jobs and results. Between a new round of bloc politics or that we become even better at cooperating over the middle. And yes, the choice is also between whether it will be Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen or me who will be prime minister in Denmark. The choice is the Danes'. The Social Democrats are prepared to take responsibility. It is now that we must hold on to the Denmark we know.

53631.0," Folkem√∏det Helle Thorning-Schmidt spoke at the Folkem√∏det on 12 June 2015. Dear everyone, How wonderful it is to be back on Bornholm. It is good to feel the lively atmosphere of the Folkem√∏det again. I have been with Folkem√∏det since it started. From that, a small experiment was initiated by local zealots. Until today, when it is a huge success that all of Denmark gathers around. Thank you to the many Bornholmers who have been involved in this year's event. Thank you to the citizens of Allinge for showing patience with us guests. We are becoming more and more. But you have hopefully gotten used to us. Because we will come again next year. Thank you to all those who came to Bornholm to participate in the political debate. And a big thank you to Winni Grosb√∏ll for hosting us all. This year it's shaking even more than usual. It is the first time that the Folkem√∏det is held in the middle of an election campaign. That does not make the People's Meeting any less interesting. On the contrary. Now I also have to confess that the general election did not completely get behind me. I am convinced that it is good that, in a time when there is gradually a DR or TV2 channel for every single Dane, there is still room for classic political debate. Not everything in the world can be experienced on an iPad. I think it is healthy that we politicians insist that the spoken word applies. So I have been looking forward to the Folkem√∏det this year. Especially because the circumstances are different this year. The election is about us wanting to preserve the Denmark we know. Or whether we have to go down an unknown path with zero growth and questionable tax cuts. The election is about how we ensure growth and jobs in Denmark while preserving our community and the Denmark that so many of us hold dear. It is about how we preserve our solidarity welfare society in a time when a lot is changing. In recent years, Denmark has gone through a severe financial and economic crisis. The worst crisis since World War II. It blew a hole in our common prosperity. It was bad. We were hit harder than other countries because good times were spent badly. That's why we started with a long tough move. Tax reform. Growth packages. Record high public investments. A lift from the primary school. Reform of SU and cash assistance. Early retirement and flexible work. A new vocational education. If there was a problem, yes, we had a reform. But we have taken responsibility. We are social democrats. There have been a bump or two in the road. Not all decisions have been equally popular. But has it been worth the price? My answer is a resounding yes. Today, Denmark stands in a new place. Most people agree on that - except the bourgeois. They are busy talking Denmark down. Maybe it's because they don't know the right context. Even the best can fail a fact check. Maybe it's because they'd rather forget what it was like. Because the reality is that the bourgeois government brought Denmark under tighter financial supervision in the EU. The social democratic led government has got us out. Before, budgets were something that was talked about. Now it's something we keep. Before, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen lost over 100,000 private jobs. Now unemployment is the lowest in five years. Denmark lost five percent of our prosperity. We have now had growth for seven quarters in a row. It is the first time in 15 years that this has happened. The bourgeois led Denmark into a historically severe crisis. And a social democratic led government got us free. Dear friends. We are out of the crisis. Denmark is back on track. I am satisfied with our results. We have solved the task we set. But what I am most proud of is that we have held each other's hands. We have taken responsibility together. Now we have to make a decision about what we want with Denmark. The Social Democrats will stay the course. Create jobs. We want to use the recovery to get all of Denmark involved. We will use the recovery to get everyone involved. To get the specialist worker up-qualified. To get those furthest away from working life into jobs. We want to invest in our common future. In our community. Do you know what the Liberal Party will use the upcoming recovery for? I have to tell you. The Left wants to use the better times to cut cash benefits. But listen now. Is there anyone who would exchange a working life for a life on cash assistance. I do not think so. The Liberals have created massive uncertainty among cash assistance recipients. But also among early pensioners and people on sickness benefits. And others who depend on the community. Why are you in such a hurry to prey on people who are already having a hard time? Left and Lars L√∏kke. It's too small. This is not how it should be in Denmark. Now we are out of the crisis. And we have shown what we are made of - when we stand together. Not even the worst crisis can crack our community. That is why it is so important that we hold on. When I get around the country, I talk to a lot of people. And although the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening and Venstre probably have figures that show otherwise, the majority of those I have met are Danes. Everywhere I meet a sincere desire for us to preserve the basic solidarity which binds our welfare society together and which sits deep within all of us. A welfare society where we have equal opportunities for everyone. That is why we must continue to invest in education. Never has any government spent as much money on education as we do today. A Denmark where you don't have to pay to go to the doctor. And where we do not gild the private hospitals at the expense of the public ones. That is why today we have 7,000 more employees in our healthcare system. We have record low waiting lists. People with mental illnesses have the same rights as other sick people. End discrimination. We must have a Denmark where it pays to work. And that is why an LO wage earner family has more for itself today than under the bourgeois government. 250,000 Danes have been lifted out of the top tax. And a single breadwinner has almost tripled his employment allowance. It is a lot of money. In short: It pays better to work today than when Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen was prime minister. We must have a Denmark where our elderly are cared for. That is why we have increased the senior citizen's check for the elderly who have the least. And we have targeted one billion kroner per year for the elderly who are most in need of help. We must have a green Denmark in balance. That is why we have the world's most ambitious climate goals. That is why we have a plan for more coherent nature. We must have a Denmark where we invest in the future of our young people. That is why our school children have several lessons in Danish and mathematics. That is why we have ensured more quality in vocational training. That is why we have never spent more money on education than we do today. And therefore we must have better standards for our youngest children. We must have a safe Denmark. That is why we have increased the punishment for gang-related crime. We have set aside one billion kroner to fight terrorism. We have set money aside for the police. We must have a Denmark where companies thrive, so that they create prosperity and jobs. And that is why we have implemented growth packages, which mean that Danish companies have become more competitive. Solidarity. Orderliness. Space for the individual. Opportunities for everyone. Strong economy. Reassurance. These are values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the Social Democrats have always stood for. It is not unnecessarily complicated. That's enough. And that is why I love the Denmark we all know so much. Can we stick to it? My answer is yes. But it requires us to choose it and to keep making decisions. Even the difficult ones. Dear everyone. There is a debate which occupies many Danes. It also occupies me. It is the issue of refugees and asylum seekers. And it has filled a lot in the election campaign. I think that is completely natural. But I would also like to say to the many thousands of Danish Muslims who go to work every day, who take an education, who contribute, you are part of Denmark. And we need you. We are a whole country. You are part of Denmark. But we are also a small country. We have always welcomed those who came either to work or because they were on the run. We also do that today. But it also makes demands when many people come at once. Because we don't want parallel societies. We don't want people sitting behind rolled-down curtains. My position is clear. If you come to Denmark, you must support yourself. You have to work. You must contribute. All over Denmark, the municipalities are making a huge effort to make this happen. So do thousands of volunteers. That's how it should be in Denmark. But we must also be able to keep up. Because otherwise it won't work. Neither for the refugees who come to Denmark. Or for the local communities. That is why the government, led by the Social Democrats, has made the first tightening of the asylum rules in 12 years. It is both proper and reasonable. At the same time, we suggest that refugees who come to Denmark should not sit and wait passively. They must contribute to Danish society. If there is a job, they must take it. Or they have to be in useful jobs. And they need to start quickly. Nothing is gained by them not starting to contribute to our community as soon as possible. That is the position of the Social Democrats. That is my position. The left is trying to make it sound as if all the refugees have been invited to Denmark by me. They have thrown so many numbers into the debate that they have tripped over them themselves. And it's not a pretty sight. Leave it. The reality is that there have not been more refugees in the world since World War II. The war in Syria. A Libya in disintegration. I have the utmost respect for my political opponent. I recognize his abilities. But peace in Syria and stability in Africa. Even for Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, it is a big mouthful. The bottom line is that the same number of asylum seekers would have come to Denmark if Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen had been prime minister. Don't let the Danes imagine something else. We now face a double challenge. We must be able to keep up. That is why we are tightening the rules. And we must ensure that the people who come to Denmark do not end up as clients. We are a small country. And I believe that this is a task that we can best solve together. And there are two parties that should go ahead. It is the Liberals and the Social Democrats.

54167.0," Yes, everyone had probably been looking forward to signs of life from the prime minister after a long summer holiday. Mainly because leadership is needed in the red government. Recipes are needed for how Denmark will get out of the crisis. There is a need to deal with the asylum problem. Management is needed. In short, there is a need for a common thread in a government that is deeply at odds with itself, and whose politics strafe in all directions. But when the Prime Minister had spoken, all expectations had to fall to the ground. There were no new messages. No new policy. No new content <U+0096> and certainly no new story either. The Prime Minister does not even have that power anymore. There was also no criticism of the policy by the prime minister, but of the narrative about the policy. The <U+0094>narrative<U+0094> thing has become such a new <U+0094>buzzword<U+0094> that commentators and spin doctors in particular love. The political content is irrelevant. It's the story, it's the <U+0094>game<U+0094> it's all about. At least they think so. In other words, there was no self-criticism to be found in Helle Thorning-Schmidt. On the other hand, firewood fell indirectly to the government's army of well-paid spin doctors and media advisers. They are the ones who have failed. They have not managed to create the right narrative about the government's policy. According to the prime minister, it has particularly harmed the government that the story of the historic breach of promise has been allowed to flourish for several months. Well, isn't it the reality that the government reneged on virtually all of its promises? It has little to do with a story. Reality always trumps the narrative. Content always wins over form. And what stories would Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt have offered the voters instead? The story about the many relaxations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãforeigners? The story about the removal of border controls and the points system? Or the story of the famous kickstart that the radicals put in the grave during the summer? No, the only thing the prime minister mumbled in TV-Avisen on Friday evening about the political visions of the coming era was something about <U+0094>the young people<U+0094> and <U+0094>more internships<U+0094>. And then there have been plenty of kicks to the government's parliamentary basis in Enhedslisten. Yes, one actually gets the impression that the prime minister is ashamed of the revolutionary left-wing party, in whose lot it has fallen to have to provide votes for the government's austerity policy. In Enhedslisten, they must understand that they have the power to parry order <U+0096> and at the moment Enhedslisten is more than busy licking its wounds after this summer's academic debate about how many toothbrushes or bicycles the Danes can own if Enhedslisten succeeds to carry out the world revolution. The truth is that the Red Government has ordered nothing but to <U+0094>tell<U+0094> itself to death. The story of the paradisiacal conditions of the coming times began long before the election. Gradually the narrative had taken on a life of its own. When the hour of truth arrived after the September election, it was far too late to adjust the narrative. Get me right there is nothing wrong with stories. All politics is naturally about telling and conveying one's messages in the best possible way. But politics is not only narrative, but also action. The form must always be matched by the content if credibility is to be ensured. The government has never understood that. But unlike the spin doctors, I would like to share my experience for free. Commentators and journalists note at regular intervals that we in the Danish People's Party are excellent storytellers. We have created an image of our party to which everyone nods in recognition. Even last week's eventful summer group meeting in Silkeborg with half-timbering and hollyhocks as an outer frame, I saw laid out as part of our narrative. But our narrative is closely linked to concrete political action. This is shown by the 10 years in which we were the parliamentary basis for the VK government. The red government and its enormous media machinery should write behind their ears that no story as good as this survives without leaving its solid imprint on the reality of the electorate. At the moment, the Danes are seriously worried about the future, about the day and the road, about the workplace and about security. The government cannot talk its way out of that problem. It can only solve this with concrete policy. But reality has long since overtaken the government.

56549.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter Monday 22 October 2012 Welcome to Borgen for Denmark's Rural Districts! On Wednesday, the Landdistrikters F√¶llesr√•d has organized a large meeting at Christiansborg. It takes place on the occasion of <U+0094>Rural Districts Day <U+0094>, and here citizens and stakeholders from all over the country have the opportunity to discuss the development in the country's rural districts and outlying areas with the politicians of the Folketing. Welcome to you - there is enough to talk about! Because you have to look for a long time among ordinary Danes to find some who do not believe that the outer areas have major challenges to contend with. The areas lose jobs, experience depopulation, have dilapidated houses, more than the national average are on transfer income and so on. Conversely, unfortunately, one does not have to look far among the government's ministers to find that there is not much help to be had here. The government started its anti-fringe policy by making Carsten Hansen (S) minister for the area. He stated that he had difficulty explaining what he, as minister for rural areas, was basically a minister for. <U+0094>The government is off to a good start<U+0094>, as Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is wont to say. Since then, he has distinguished himself by setting up a so-called vision group of nine well-known Danes, who will give their bid for <U+0094>Utkantsdanmark anno 2030<U+0094>. Be preserved - the minister came on TV with that initiative, but it is a bit difficult to see how it will concretely make a difference for the outer areas in either the short or the medium term. However, concrete measures have resulted in the government closing down the demolition pool, which otherwise gave the municipalities better opportunities to remove dilapidated houses. But otherwise it must be quietly stated that in its first year of existence, the government has not had outlying areas particularly high on its agenda. This may be because they have had the EU presidency and have chosen to prioritize this over the Danes who do not live in one of the country's major cities. Or it could be because the government's ministers are just not particularly concerned with the immediate problems of Danes. I fear the latter! Precisely the pool for the demolition of dilapidated houses in rural areas is an example of the government's arrogance towards the outlying areas. Here was an initiative which both beautified the areas for those who today live and live their lives in the areas <U+0096> but which at the same time made the areas more attractive for immigration. A modest government initiative that had a great effect. With surgical precision the government swung the knife over the pool <U+0096> because the government is basically completely indifferent to the rural areas. The demolition pool, or the investment pool as it is rightly called, has been a strong contributing factor to the fact that over 3,500 buildings have been demolished and 1,325 buildings have been renovated over the course of just over two years. Therefore the pool should be reintroduced from 1 January 2013. There are many other things that the government could do for the outlying areas if it wanted to. For example, it is not a natural law that government workplaces must be located in the larger cities. In fact, it is thus that the Capital Region has no fewer than 44.3 percent of government jobs. This is a clear over-representation in relation to how many people live in the region. Therefore, the Danish People's Party will soon put forward a motion to ensure that a plan is drawn up for the relocation of government workplaces to the country's so-called outer municipalities and rural municipalities. Now Carsten Hansen has admittedly stated at a consultation (28/2-2012) that the government has no current plans to move government workplaces out of the province, but it may be that the government has become wiser since then. Better framework conditions must also be created for business, so that new private jobs can be created. This applies not only in rural areas, but throughout Denmark. A number of the government's taxes will hit and have hit business hard. I am thinking, for example, of the so-called NOx tax and the sugar tax. Such taxes are not the right way to create growth and jobs. Maybe in the countries where growth and jobs move as a result of the taxes, but probably not in Denmark! And the outlying areas are hit particularly hard <U+0096> because if a business has closed down, it is more difficult than in the larger urban areas to get a new one to start. There must be control over the infrastructure. Businesses need to be able to get their goods back and forth, and infrastructure is also about the internet! It must be fast and stable. The latter is actually something that both the companies and the Danes are very keen on. I have read that studies show that 75 percent of Danes give a high priority to a fast broadband connection when they have to move. The Internet has become such an integrated and natural part of many Danes' everyday lives today that the prospect of a sluggish and unstable Internet seems decidedly discouraging. The state should take greater responsibility for this in the outlying areas. I am thinking here that there could be universal service on the internet in the same way as we know it with electricity. For many companies today, internet access is indispensable, and if they cannot be sure that they have constant access to the web, well, then there is a great risk that they will opt out of a future in the province. The Danish People's Party therefore has a number of concrete proposals for how we can reverse the development in the outlying areas. Now we just wait for the government to show that it is the government for all of Denmark. Also for those who live outside the country's major cities. In the first instance, we welcome the rural districts to Borgen on Wednesday <U+0096> I look forward to the debate with you!

57130.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter Tuesday 10 November 2015 Ready for a three-week scare campaign? Dear everyone. Welcome to three weeks of repetition of the usual myths and platitudes about the EU. Many can remember previous polls and what came with them. For good reasons, I do not even remember the vote on Danish membership of the then EC in 1972 <U+0096> was 3 years old - but I have seen several times how the supporters at that time had seriously sat and counted on the fact that a pound of coffee and a pack of butter would cost extra if we didn't vote yes to the membership. It would be expensive. Very expensive. How they calculated that, I don't know. But you just had to understand that they were right. If the Danes had not said yes to the EC, then we would almost certainly have gone bankrupt. The accidents had been lined up. It happened again when we had to vote on the <U+0094>union<U+0094> in June 1992. Yes, the one who, according to the then Prime Minister Poul Schl√ºter, was <U+0094>stone dead<U+0094> <U+0096 > but let's vote on it, it had to and the Danes, as you know, said no thank you. It led to a kind of mental state of emergency during some of the most beautiful June days Denmark has experienced. June days, which were not made worse by the fact that Denmark completely unexpectedly won the European Championship in football. It was a fantastic summer in every way. But the concern was great among all experts, who with deep frowns assessed that <U+0094>it will now be very difficult for Denmark, because now we have gone off on a side track<U+0094>. The same thing happened again when the following year we had to vote on the Edinburgh Treaty with the four EU reservations we have today. It was the 18th of May 1993, and that day became known for some of the worst battles between the autonomous community and the police in N√∏rrebro. Again there was some symbolism about things. Ever since then, the Yes parties have been deeply ashamed of the Danish reservations. They have subsequently looked for every opportunity to have the reservations abolished. As early as 2000, they had had so much blood on their teeth that they made the attempt: the Danes had to vote on the euro. The whole of official Denmark, consisting of almost all the parties in the Folketing, the business community and the trade union movement, explained to the Danes that it would cost the country a double-digit billion sum to say no and that the country would be definitively sidetracked. Again, I am a little impressed by how they were able to calculate the price so accurately, just as I am surprised that no one has subsequently actually accused them of their gross misjudgment. Not even the most ardent supporter of the EU would seriously claim today that the euro has been a success. The same with the open borders. We probably weren't allowed to vote on them. But we had to understand that they were necessary for growth and development. Otherwise <U+0094>the car queues would stretch all the way down to Cologne<U+0094>, as Margrete Auken once said in a debate. But today we can see that the premise <U+0096> of effective guarding of the EU's external borders <U+0096> never became a reality. Today, primarily the endless streams of migrants benefit from the open borders because they can freely travel around the EU and settle where they think the conditions are best. Currently it is in Sweden. Tomorrow it could be Denmark Now the Yes parties have made preparations again. The direct reason is that Denmark cannot continue unchanged in Europol, as police cooperation will probably move from an intergovernmental to a supranational level at some point next year. This means that a change must take place, and the EU-happy parties have therefore bet their whole store on Europol being the means to get the Danes to abolish the entire reservation of rights. You have to admit that they are quite cunning and try to cover up their maneuver. The smokescreen consists of an agreement which deals with 22 legal acts, which will become part of Danish legislation if the Danes vote yes to abolishing the reservation of rights. What they, on the other hand, are reluctant to say is that the Danes at the same time leave it to a majority in the Folketing to hand over all other sovereignty in the legal field on behalf of the Danes <U+0096> including asylum and immigration policy! The maneuver is problematic in relation to the Constitution. It prescribes that one surrenders sovereignty over a limited area. But on 3 December, the population is asked to say yes to the fact that the Danish Parliament itself can in future choose where sovereignty is to be handed over to the EU. Then you also get rid of the trouble of involving the Danes. And although the EU-happy parties try to claim that it is defined and well-known <U+0096> and that, for example, asylum and immigration policy is outside, others are in yes- the ranks different honest. SF says, for example, on their election posters that we must be <U+0094>together about refugees<U+0094>. Your MEPs have made it clear that only with a yes can you achieve a common European asylum and immigration policy, of which Denmark is a part. A no prevents that! And experts have stated that Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen's guarantee of a referendum on the common asylum policy is legally worthless. Although it would probably otherwise apply until the sun burns out If the EU-happy parties for some reason want to join Denmark to the common asylum and immigration policy, they will be able to say with full right that <U+0094> said so the Danes yes until December 3<U+0094>. There are already LOTS of examples of things we've said <U+0094>yes<U+0094> to without knowing it. And when you ask when the Danes said yes to it, reference is always made to a vote or to a treaty that was approved many years ago. How many Danes knew, for example, in 1972 that they agreed to a community where citizens from other EU countries would be entitled to Danish welfare benefits? No one had told them that. History is full of such examples! And it will happen again. So welcome to three weeks of massive scare campaigns from the yes side. So-called <U+0094>experts<U+0094> from e.g. Dansk Industris <U+0094>Think tank Europe<U+0094> will explain that everything is hopeless if we say no. They will try to explain that we will never be able to get a parallel agreement on Europol. They will explain that the Danish police will remain undressed. That the criminals get free play. That you almost support pedophiles if you vote no please on December 3. Yes, in short, they will explain that Denmark will become a hell for the world's criminals if we say no to abolishing our entire reserve of rights. I hope the Danes see through it! That we are exposed to the same tune as every single time it is about the EU. Because Denmark does not quit Europol with a no. Quite simply because it is more important for all law-abiding people to catch criminals than to be angry that the Danes want to keep the reservation of rights. Everyone has an interest in Denmark being with d&eacuter. And yes ‚Äì a parallel agreement on Europol will be able to fall into place quickly, as the entire process is already in place. It's pure politics! I wish you a lot of fun in the coming weeks. The yes-sayers will trip over each other to outbid each other in scare examples. In the Danish People's Party, we keep a cool head and will insist that the Danes must know as much as possible about what we are voting on. If the Danes are fully informed, we can safely leave it to the Danes to make the nation's choice.

56751.0," In February 2018, the Social Democrats presented their big immigration policy plan ""Fair and realistic - An immigration policy that unites Denmark"". A nice, glossy publication with a smiling Mette Frederiksen on the cover, which was distributed household to many Danish homes. The purpose of the plot was to make the voters believe that the Social Democrats had now broken with the party's until then naive and irresponsible policy on immigration. That there were now completely new additions to the soup: Asylum processing had to be moved away from Denmark and to a third country. It should only be possible to get asylum in Denmark as a quota refugee through the UN. Rejected asylum seekers were to be sent home and it was to be more difficult to be reunited with their families. Just as a cap on non-Western immigration was to be introduced. The Social Democrats had regretted decades of policy in the area - now they had realized that the rest of us had been right all along - one had to understand! It was also new tones, which could go a long way to reminding of the policy that the Danish People's Party has stood for for decades. It certainly wasn't by chance... That's why I also welcomed the move then ‚Äì in February 2018. I was actually so excited that I suggested to Mette Frederiksen that we immediately sit down and get a majority in place to implement the sensible proposals. There was no need to wait for an election, I thought. Unfortunately, nothing came of it... But now the play will be put to the test. The Social Democracy must be held responsible! Because what was the intention of the move? To win the election to get the proposals implemented? Or come up with the proposals to win the election? We have gone through the proposed ""Fair and realistic"" with a close comb and found a large number of proposals for austerity, which the Social Democratic Party promised the Danes before the election to implement, but which have not come to fruition. We have then word for word made the strictures into a number of resolution proposals (12 in total), which will be discussed in the Danish Parliament in the coming time. On Thursday, the first three proposals were then dealt with in the parliamentary hall. Specifically, a proposal to introduce a cap on non-Western immigration, a proposal to oblige all immigrants on integration benefits and cash assistance to contribute 37 hours a week and a proposal to revoke citizenship in the event of a crime that is dangerous to the person. Good and sensible suggestions. How did it go? Well, Immigration Minister Mattias Tesfaye ended up having to explain why the government does not intend to vote for its own policy. That the Social Democrats will not put action behind words. Surprised in the parliamentary hall, we had to witness Mattias Tesfaye come up with one explanation after another as to why the government will not vote for proposals that are taken verbatim from their own plan. At least not right now ‚Äì and perhaps not quite in the way that they themselves had written in their plan ‚Äì just as the Social Democrats are now suddenly not entirely sure whether an election promise can be realized within the framework of the international conventions that they after all, don't want to break up... And that's how it ended. However, Mattias Tesfaye assured that the proposals are still being worked on. Wow! What admission about his own election promises to the Danes...? So far, the conclusion must be that the big chrome-plated scheme ""Fair and realistic - An immigration policy that unites Denmark"" was primarily about making Mette Frederiksen prime minister. After she has taken up the post, it is apparently not quite so important to make the promises to the Danes a reality.

56456.0," What a lovely weekend. With both the opportunity to meet DF members at the Christmas meeting and to have wood sawn in the garden. Just the kind of thing I enjoy after a long process with this year's Finance Act. And which financial law? A really good one of the kind that contains classic DF policy: Restrictions on immigration and better conditions for our elderly. In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration, the entire focus changes from being about integration from day one to preparing refugees and migrants for having to travel home again. A change in immigration policy, which is on par with the sweeping change that took place after the general election in 2001. It was then that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen lost government power and the DF gained direct influence for the first time. With S√∏ren Krarup and Jesper Langballe at the table, in April 2002 we negotiated the first large package for foreigners in place. A package which marked a decisive change in Danish immigration policy. Now we take the next big step. Now it is about the paradigm shift in immigration policy. We have long argued that refugees should only receive help and protection in Denmark on a temporary basis. They must return home and help rebuild their country as soon as possible. But it is only now that we have got a majority in the Danish Parliament on board with the idea. So it is ensured that from now on it will be exactly the logic that meets asylum seekers when they come to Denmark. That starting point will permeate laws and regulations in such a way that it will be clear to everyone that an asylum seeker or family reunification must only be in Denmark temporarily. Instead of an integration program, you become part of a self-sufficiency and return home program. Repatriation rather than integration! The fact that, in order to ensure this, we have to go right to the edge of the international conventions, we live with that just fine. It is not conventions that should stand in the way of doing what is necessary to secure Denmark. With the financial law agreement, we are also significantly tightening the grip on rejected and criminal foreigners who do not want to leave the country voluntarily. Those people have nothing to do in Denmark. And now we are setting up a new departure center on the island of Lindholm in Stege Bay, where the most unsympathetic of the rejected foreigners, whom we cannot get rid of for various reasons, must stay until they leave the country. It is, among other things, persons on tolerated stay and deported criminal aliens. They are moved away from K√¶rshovedg√•rd in Central Jutland, where they have spread unrest and insecurity, and onto an uninhabited island, where the neighbors are far away. Here they have a duty to report and a duty to stay during the night hours. At the same time, we make the punishment significantly tougher if they do not comply with these duties and ensure that there are police on site around the clock. The Finance Act also ensures better conditions for early and public pensioners. Many pensioners will experience a real boost in their financial options. It happens i.a. in that we relax the very rigid set-off rules. In this way, we also ensure that more people get more out of having saved a little money for their own pension. Those pensioners who have the strength to make a dent in the labor market will also get more out of it. Today, the set-off rules have meant that many have felt cheated. We have also found out that the rate pool is disappearing. The pool has become extra famous after the case of Britta Nielsen's possible fraud with funds from the pool. But it is actually the country's public pensioners who have contributed the most to the pool over the years. And this has led to an erosion of the public pension. Not large amounts each year - but over the years it has become several thousand kroner annually. This erosion now stops. And of course it will have great importance as the years go by. So, all in all, this is a really sensible financial law, which also contains a large number of good initiatives in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhealth, border control, animal welfare, etc., which I do not have the space to mention here.

56504.0," I hope everyone has a good Easter. Enjoyed some days off. Although it has been a bit cold, the sun has crept out. The government is getting ready for elections. Trying to buy the Danes with big campaigns. But we have to tell what the government's policy means for Denmark - then the Danes will probably have to take a stand. And it is well known that, as a consequence of the government's many relaxations in immigration policy, we have seen an influx of asylum seekers to Denmark, the like of which has not been seen for many years. This puts the municipalities under enormous pressure, because they are the ones who in practice have to accept the many new refugees. According to the National Association of Municipalities and the government, housing for approximately 12,000 must be found this year alone! As if this is not many enough, family reunifications come on top... That is why the government has now come up with a bill that will give the municipalities a freer hand to accommodate these refugees, while the citizens of the individual municipalities, in turn, will be sidetracked. If, or one should perhaps rather say when, the law is adopted in the Danish Parliament, then, for example, a closed school can be transformed into a home for refugees in just two weeks. And the locals therefore have just 14 days to object if they do not see the sense in becoming neighbors to a place that decisively changes its character. Previously, the locals had the right to be heard for eight weeks, but now their opportunities to object are severely limited. As a result of its irresponsible immigration policy, the government is thus letting Danes' rights be mocked. But it is therefore completely understandable if there are citizens who believe that it is a bad idea to push a larger number of refugees into one's immediate area. The newspaper Politiken, for example, has written about a closed school in Ribe, which is faced with having to house refugees. The citizens express their concern in the article. <U+0094>I think it is rude that the municipality is given free rein to decide whether refugees should live there. It goes beyond house prices in the area, and it is us who have paid for the houses<U+0094>, says one. Another says, <U+0094>it is a denial of democracy<U+0094>. Yes, that's actually exactly what it is! The short consultation period makes citizen involvement an illusion, and this clearly shows that there are major consequences associated with the government's immigration policy. It is therefore not just a matter of whether the costs of asylum, family reunification, etc. has gone from DKK 2.9 billion in 2011 to an expected DKK 9.2 billion in 2015. It is also about the fact that basic civil rights are now being curtailed to a significant extent. Lawyer and specialist in environmental law H√•kun Djurhuus has said the following about the proposal: <U+0094>It is totally unacceptable because the law ‚Äì even with a two-week consultation period ‚Äì will deny citizens' most central rights in the planning law. I don't recall seeing such a far-reaching proposal before. It is quite unusual<U+0094>. The fact that the municipalities largely accept this drastic step on the part of the government does not really surprise me. They have been given an unreasonably large task by the government, and now the government is coming to their rescue, admittedly at the expense of the citizens. The municipalities are of course happy about that rescue, now that they have been given the task. On the other hand, it really surprises me that there are not more parties in the Danish Parliament that clearly say no to this consequence of the government's immigration policy. That they don't say that this is fundamentally wrong. The bill was for 1st reading in the Folketing just before Easter, and LA, V and K believe that the bill is necessary under the circumstances. Circumstances therefore mean the huge number of asylum seekers applying to Denmark. So you accept that citizens' rights must be denied as a result of the government's immigration policy! But it shouldn't be like that. We can choose something else! The immigration policy must be strongly adjusted so that not so many asylum seekers come to Denmark. There must be no more than that we are able to handle them without encroaching on citizens' rights. From 2002 to 2011, when the Danish People's Party was influential, an average of approximately 3,600 asylum seekers came to Denmark. In 2012 ‚Äì after Helle Thorning-Schmidt joined ‚Äì there were 6184. In 2013 there were 7557, and last year there were almost 15,000 asylum seekers! These figures show that we can control the development if we want to! This government does not want to - and will therefore have to - restrict the rights of the Danes. We want another way!

56317.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter Monday 14 April 2014 More foreign criminals must be deported! - security must be restored Recently, there have been several examples of criminal foreigners who have avoided deportation <U+0096> even though the nature of their crimes is extremely violent. An example is the four young men who were found guilty of violence resulting in death against the 20-year-old education student Ali Agha in Copenhagen. Here, the leading perpetrator, Osama Jaffar, in addition to eight years in prison, was only conditionally deported from Denmark. According to the court, the reason for the conditional deportation was that Jaffar does not speak Arabic and therefore could not be deported to Iraq. Last year, the Eastern High Court ruled in a case of rape and aggravated robbery against a 22-year-old man, in which two Iranian men were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms. One of the perpetrators is scheduled to be deported to Iran after serving half of his sentence, but the deportation sentence can be changed if it is judged that it is too dangerous for him to be sent to Iran. In addition, the well-known criminals <U+0094>Store A<U+0094> and Dollar Levakovic have also escaped deportation, even though their criminal CV is long and includes, for example, extremely serious violent assaults. The point is that more criminals with a foreign background are now avoiding deportation, which is clearly unacceptable. But the government has a shared responsibility for this development. Previously, the rules were that criminals had to be deported, unless there was clear evidence that a deportation was in violation of Denmark's obligations in relation to international conventions. But now the rules have changed, and a reference to a family connection to Denmark can, for example, be sufficient to avoid deportation. We therefore need a debate about what Denmark should actually support. What is our responsibility towards the foreign criminals? How much do the Danes have to settle for <U+0096> and from whom? Every year we deport asylum seekers who quite openly come to Denmark to take advantage of the processing time to commit crimes. Thus, their applications are also obviously groundless, and they can be deported without further ado. With their behavior they have clearly proven that they will not conform to Danish conditions. But this concept also applies to foreign nationals. If they commit crime, they make a clear choice <U+0096> and thus in reality they choose Denmark. All experience shows that the threat of deportation is one of the most feared things among foreign criminals, while a stay in prison is rarely considered a real punishment. We must therefore become much better at showing foreign citizens that they have a responsibility for what they do if they want to be in Denmark. We must become much better at showing consistency. It is not just about preventing crime. It is also about the population's sense of justice. The Danish People's Party wants to return to the old rules <U+0096> and of course also see how Denmark can protect itself further in relation to these criminal persons. If you commit a crime that endangers people in this country, it is only natural that the Danes want to be able to say goodbye and thank you. If you commit a crime dangerous to the person, you have actively chosen Denmark as a future place of residence. In addition, it should generally be made more difficult to obtain Danish citizenship. The old requirements for passing the citizenship test must be reintroduced, and the requirement for knowledge of Danish culture and history must once again be given priority. The same applies to the requirement for self-sufficiency. Danish citizenship must not be something that is granted automatically. Danish citizenship is the greatest gift Denmark can give a person. You definitely have to earn it. This implies, as an absolute minimum, that a foreigner must keep his path clean and make an effort to comply with the law in the country. Otherwise, the person concerned should find another place to stay. The list of the government's relaxations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãforeigners is long. Common to the relaxations is that they have made Denmark more attractive as a travel destination for foreigners <U+0096> not least in relation to the economic aspect. The low initial aid and the cash aid ceiling have been removed, and this kind of thing is quickly rumored in the sending countries. The government itself claims that not a single comma has changed in the asylum legislation, and this is correct in isolation. But other areas have been eased so much that more asylum seekers are prepared to apply to Denmark. In short, the Danish People's Party wants to get immigration policy back on track. Immigration policy must be normalized. It must again be reasonable and fair. A strict immigration policy is a crucial condition for the integration of those who are already here to be possible. This is again crucial to ensure the security of the Danes in their own country.

57465.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly letter <U+0096> Monday 1 May 2017 A little more Dannebrog <U+0096> a little less red flags On such a 1 May, much is as it usually is. The red banners fly, left-wing politicians and union bosses make speeches. The socialist battle cries of class struggle, togetherness and solidarity still echo through the air in some places. There is a lot of tradition and history about it. There should be no doubt that the labor movement has played a major role in building our welfare society. And played a big role in securing the workers <U+0096> the wage earners - decent conditions. We should appreciate that. We must appreciate that. It is certainly worth celebrating. And I am also pleased that the relationship between the Danish People's Party and the trade union movement is much better today than it was years ago. And here I think first of all that the leadership in the various trade unions has moved. Among the rank-and-file members there have long been many who agreed with the Danish People's Party's policy. Also many who vote for DF in various elections. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that the trade union movement has loosened its close ties to the Social Democracy and now cooperates broadly with several parties in the Folketing, including not least the Danish People's Party. That serves the members best. Yes, that actually serves Denmark best. So it's definitely worth celebrating too. Conditions on the labor market are of course very important on such a 1st of May. That's how it should be. But, if you really want to speak up for the workers, then you will also have to deal with some of the other challenges that Denmark is facing. And let's just say it like it is. The challenge in particular is particularly great: The violent immigration of people from very alien cultures in the Middle East and Africa in particular is a gigantic challenge. Both financially and in terms of value. It challenges our culture ‚Äì our cohesion. Many years of misguided and irresponsible immigration policy have had huge costs for Denmark. Every year we spend large sums of billions on a failed immigration policy. The Ministry of Finance has just calculated the bill for non-Western immigrants. It cost the public coffers at least NOK 33 billion in 2014. Many immigrants do not contribute positively to the community, but instead fill up courtrooms and prisons, unemployment and transfer income statistics. Many of these people become part of parallel societies with values ‚Äã‚Äãand attitudes that are far from the Danish ones. It is the single biggest threat to our welfare society. It should not be possible for a politician to step up to a podium today without addressing this overriding challenge for Denmark. But also like tomorrow, so let action follow the words!! They should also say something on the same occasion about the problems that the EU creates for the Danish labor market model. The Internal Market has made it easier to trade together, and that is good. But the open borders and the EU's rules have also led to social dumping via many of the Eastern Europeans who work in Denmark. We have no interest in a parallel labor market where ordinary Danes with families and obligations are exposed to unfair competition. Regardless of whether it is done by Eastern Europeans or by illegals, as was revealed recently in a TV2 documentary. It is undermining our society and creates insecurity for the individual Danes who are affected. We must secure the Danish community. We must stand together for Denmark. D&eacute message I agree with most of the speakers here on May 1. But the fight to secure it is also about strict immigration policy and rejection of the EU deciding so much. That way, I would like to see a little more Dannebrog on such a 1st of May <U+0096> in return for a little less red flags.

57364.0," But the election campaign does not only take place in the media. We have also started our big road show, where we go around the country to talk to the Danes and hear about what concerns them and of course also talk about what we stand for.

I can only say that it is a real pleasure to go around the Danish country like this. Because I have met a lot of happy and inquisitive people and the enthusiasm, fighting spirit and optimism of our local people is great. This bodes well for our election campaign. Tomorrow I'm going for a trip to the election debate at Kronborg. and here the participants will hardly show the indecision and fickleness that the famous Hamlet does in Shakespeare's play, which takes place precisely at Kronborg. One of the important topics that will definitely be on the agenda is social dumping. It hasn't filled that much of the election campaign yet, but I'm sure it will. Too many Danes are affected by unfair competition, which makes it difficult to take part in the economic recovery, which is otherwise cautiously on the way. The short and the long is that it is the EU's so-called free movement of labor in particular that has created unreasonable pressure on several EU countries - e.g. countries such as Denmark and Great Britain. Up to 100,000 eastern workers are now in Denmark, and there is nothing to indicate that that number will not just grow and grow if we do not do something about the problem. Basically, it is problematic and paradoxical that we bring in labor from outside while Danes are unemployed. And with the many eastern workers also come wage suppression and social dumping. It is excellent that various initiatives have been taken in recent years to make life a little more difficult for those who speculate on the cheap labour. But it is not, as for example Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the Social Democrats seem to think, solved by a little more control on the construction sites. We need to address the more fundamental problem. and here it is therefore necessary to challenge the EU. It can be done, because we are not alone. The re-elected British Prime Minister David Cameron has been on a tour to gain support for his and the British's wishes to limit Eastern Europeans' access to the British labor market and British welfare schemes. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised in this connection that she will enter into these discussions constructively. Because she wants to find a solution, she says. She must of course be held to that. But it will also be decisive whether Denmark is an active ally for the British in the fight for a solution, which can also subsequently become Denmark's solution to these challenges. David Cameron was actually supposed to have met with Helle Thorning-Schmidt about the matter on Thursday, but the election publication put a natural stop to that. And hopefully this means that after the election, Cameron will meet a Danish Prime Minister who is more prepared to find solutions to the obvious problems with eastern workers and social dumping and thus help Denmark become an active ally for the British. That Helle Thorning-Schmidt has made it one of her hallmarks that Denmark must stick as close to the core of the EU as possible is a regrettable fact. I hope that the election provides a change of direction for Denmark, so that we can work closely with our British friends to reform the EU and thereby ensure greater self-determination for the countries in the EU. Good election campaign - and see you again to many of you - also those who come on Friday, when we are sticking to our Constitution Festival at Lykkesholm on Funen!

54315.0," Dansk Folkepartis Ugebrev - Monday, August 23, 2010 v/ Deputy Chairman, Peter Skaarup Another case of Muslim women's oppression The weekend just past started with a story about a violent assault on a young Syrian woman, who was kidnapped by two men, for the eyes of her mother when she went for a walk in Frederiksv√¶rk. The case initially looked like a case of general unrest at an asylum center, but as the case was unraveled, it dawned on the police and the rest of Denmark that this was an unusually gross and ugly case involving human trafficking, deprivation of liberty, violence and rape. The grotesque thing is that the 40-year-old man, who, according to the available information, was behind the abuse, on some level acted in 'good faith', because he acted based on general Muslim traditions that apply in his home country. Together with an accomplice, the 40-year-old kidnapper has been remanded in custody while the police investigate the matter further. We have been informed by the media that the man thought the woman had promised to marry him because he had arranged to help her flee to Denmark and seek asylum. The woman had refused after coming to Denmark, and therefore he tried to use his right as a Muslim man to force her into marriage. When the woman continued to refuse, he chose to rape her, the most degrading act a Muslim woman can be subjected to, because it will degrade her and label her as a prostitute. In Iran, on top of that, there are examples of women who have been sentenced to stoning after being raped, because they have thereby 'had sex outside of marriage'. In the 40-year-old's home country, his actions would probably not have generated much attention. Fortunately, they do that in Denmark! The story is scary because one could fear that there have been more examples of these kinds of cases that we just never hear about. Cases where a man forces a woman to marry him, as payment for helping her escape to Denmark. In doing so, he abuses both the woman and the Danish asylum system. The 19-year-old Syrian woman was strong and fought against it, there are probably many women in the same situation who don't dare. The 19-year-old woman may have believed that she could be protected from Islam's women-oppressive laws here in democratic and equal Denmark. Unfortunately, Sharia had crept in through the back door. The 40-year-old kidnapper is a resident of an asylum center in Amager, and one must therefore assume that he is also in the process of applying for asylum and permanent residence in Denmark. He has clearly come to Denmark under false pretenses when he goes against everything we stand for here in the country. There is also no doubt that his asylum case must therefore be discontinued as soon as possible, and he must be deported from Denmark. Denmark must not spend resources on protecting people with such a medieval, woman-degrading view of humanity, which they are trying to introduce into Danish society on top of that. We must show the outside world that this is in no way acceptable behavior in Denmark, therefore he must be sent home. Such cases must be dealt with severely. It offends me every time I experience how women in Denmark must continue to live as second-class citizens because Muslim men treat them as such. Veiled young women who are hidden away in apartments in ghettos because they have to live by the Koranic rules of being virgins until the day they are married off. From the study <U+0094>To be a Muslim woman in Denmark<U+0094> from the Ministry of Welfare in 2009, it appeared on the basis of a series of interviews with such women that the pervasive problem for virtually all those interviewed is the social control in their own environments. Broadly speaking, the girls and women feel that they must live up to the expectation of being a respectable virgin when entering into the expected marriage. These expectations subsequently affect all aspects of women's lives from dress to elective education, leisure interests, careers, social behavior and choice of spouse. Therefore, it was also pleasing to read in the weekend's newspapers that there are now significantly more women with an immigrant background who are applying to higher education. How happy I was, because it is just proof that integration can work well in Denmark. It is through education and participation in Danish society that the foreigners must settle in. These women, who are now getting an education, cannot avoid having a completely different view of women's rights and equality than they would have if they had remained veiled at home in the care of their fathers or husbands. It is therefore also important to introduce with a forward-looking, targeted effort towards the young, uneducated men, who contribute to a large extent to holding on to their old traditions, to subjugate and maintain the women in a socially closed network. We need the men to understand that they must give their women the freedom to become part of Danish society, where women and men participate equally in everyday life as such, including social activities and education. The Danish People's Party has worked for increased integration and continues to do so under the overall approach to things, that foreigners in Denmark themselves must show an interest in and willingness to become a full part of the society and the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat Denmark is built on. This also applies to equality between men and women. If foreigners want to preserve their own traditions and ways of life, which are totally at odds with our society, then there is no reason for them to live in this country. The announcement of more immigrant women in higher education is proof that we still have a long and tough battle ahead of us when it comes to integration, but that we are moving in the right direction.

54367.0," Think that the left wing has been so eager to investigate former minister Inger St√∏jberg's possible breach of the rules in the child marriage case, but has been almost impossible to push for a real investigation of the government's scandalous handling of the mink crisis. That says a bit about their principles. A bit like when the president of the Nature Conservation Association, the former member of parliament for Enhedslisten Marie Reumert Gjerding, stands with her rubber boots on at tv2 news to chastise the country's farmers, only to now be totally absent in the matter of the buried mink and their impact on the groundwater... It is the friends who have made the scandals now... But for the rest of us, it's really good news. We must get to the bottom of the government's illegalities! The Danes must know the truth. It is the parties in the Folketing that have now agreed that a so-called ""scrutiny commission"" must be set up, which is a parliamentary innovation. It has been crucial for DF that there is an investigation where an impartial judge sits at the end of the table and where the commission has the opportunity to summon and question witnesses. Officials as ministers! The parliamentary parties must now agree before Christmas on which questions, more precisely, the Commission of Inquiry must uncover. The parties must also choose the high court judge who will sit at the end of the table. For many years, DF has argued that a new form of parliamentary investigation was needed, which could be set up by the Folketing and where it was possible to call witnesses. Now we are getting a new parliamentary tool, which is very similar to what we have previously proposed. We are of course happy about that. And there is a good need for an effective tool to get to the bottom of this whole quagmire. Because new revelations keep coming. Most recently, several media have described how it was Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen herself who called the fur breeders' chairman Tage Pedersen to insist that the culling should continue, even though doubts had arisen about the dangerousness of the virus mutations in mink. Incidentally, this happened at a time when, at least in the Ministry of Food, it had become known that there was a lack of legal authority for the order to kill healthy mink. The other day, BT was able to reveal that the Prime Minister's chief of staff, Martin Justesen, was directly involved in the Ministry of Food's press handling of the case. So a clear picture emerges that Mette Frederiksen and her ministry have been deeply involved in the mink scandal. Even so, she refuses to show up for consultations in the Folketing and give an account of, among other things, her chief of staff role. Just as the Prime Minister will not stand up for critical interviews in the media either. So therefore a thorough investigation is necessary. And that is why it is good that there is a majority in the Danish Parliament that now ensures that. There is plenty to be done!

56088.0," During Sunday, information emerged that the suicide bomber was a 28-year-old Iraqi who came to Sweden as a refugee in 1992. Before committing his crime, he had declared on his Facebook profile that the Swedes should die. Partly because of the engagement in Afghanistan, partly because the Swedish artist Lars Vilks has depicted the prophet as a dog with impunity. The Swedes are understandably shocked and shaken. The same is the Swedish Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt, who, however, urged caution. There is still speculation as to whether the bomber acted on his own, or whether several people were behind it. Many seem to wonder that it could happen in Sweden <U+0096> but why would Sweden be something special. We must understand that the Islamists' hatred of the West knows no national borders. The Nordics' first terrorist attack. Yes, the first completed terrorist attack. We have already witnessed several failed <U+0096> possible ‚Äì attempts. For example, the assassination of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard or the mysterious Chechen bomber who was arrested in Copenhagen in September and who is still in prison. The Swedish authorities have acted correctly by being present on the streets of Stockholm. Unfortunately, terrorism and especially the threat of terrorism is something we have to learn to live with. We must understand that there are forces that hate the West, our democracy and our way of life <U+0096> and that in some cases these forces exist in our own societies due to immigration. The fact that a terrorist attack is taking place in Sweden can't really surprise anyone. For years, Sweden has pursued a particularly liberal and uncritical immigration policy, and the last election to the Riksdag was an indication that the Swedes are getting seriously worried. Fortunately, we have not experienced that anyone has tried to make a political dent in the serious situation. Perhaps with the exception of the conservative integration rapporteur, Naser Khader. Without any reason whatsoever, he was out on Sunday warning that <U+0094>right-wing extremists<U+0094> will be able to exploit the fear that the terrorist attack has created <U+0096> and with a direct address to the Sweden Democrats. Naser Khader thus seems less affected by the fact that innocent people are at risk of being blown up than by the prospect of the right wing trying to take advantage of this situation. I recall that attempts were made to establish the association <U+0094>Democratic Muslims<U+0094>. As far as I remember, it all drowned in chaos and discord. But wasn't it worth trying again? I would like to see the democratic and moderate Muslims take an unequivocal distance from acts of terrorism. Especially when right now we need the attitude of the democratic Muslims more than ever before. When will we see a popular showdown with the Islamists, an unequivocal distancing from the darkened fundamentalist forces who are allowed to set the agenda. From the Muslim spiritual leaders we hear nothing. Yes, we may hear a bit about how terrorism has nothing to do with Islam and that suicide is forbidden according to the Koran. But how can it be that it is precisely Muslims who use these methods? A 28-year-old Iraqi, who has lived in Sweden since 1992, can hardly have been on the run from the Americans in Iraq, all the while his family must have fled from Saddam Hussein's regime of terror. Where does the hate come from? I'm already hearing the arguments that you can't ask Muslims to take a stand. But why not? Is it the fear of doing the <U+0094>wrong people's<U+0094> errand that keeps them back? Why do moderate Muslims even consider an imam like Abdul Wahid Petersen to be their mouthpiece <U+0096> or for that matter the Islamic Community? If an Indremission preacher were to speak on my behalf, I would probably have to quit right away. I simply did not want to be defined within any religious context. In short, I am calling for moderate Muslims to free themselves from their religious straitjacket. You don't want to be defined as Muslims? No, but then come out and join the debate on an equal footing with the rest of us. I look forward to seeing more Muslims get involved in the entire Danish debate <U+0096> also on wind turbine test centers and traffic policy. Not as Muslims, not as Turks, Iraqis or Palestinians. But as equal citizens in Danish society. However, this implies a clear support for Danish democracy and an equally clear distancing from terror. I don't think my demands are unreasonable.

55588.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly letter <U+0096> Tuesday 7 June 2016 Kristian Thulesen Dahl's constitutional speech 2016 Our great poet H.C. Andersen came here on Lykkesholm. He was inspired for many of his great works on his travels. Among other things to write the fairy tale <U+0094>Twelve by post<U+0094>. A fairy tale about the turn of the year. The 12 months of the year. June is about the young lady. Young, fine, proud, pretty <U+0096> and generous! You have to say that Lykkesholm also shows its generous side today. And now we're talking about generosity. Then I'll just ask Have you remembered? That it is Father's Day today? You were also generous in showing up to our pig parties. Can recognize many of you. Approx. 1,800 over 3 Saturdays for roast suckling pig, jazz and draft beer. Those of you, those who did not participate must remember to come next time we do something similar. Today is the Constitution's birthday. And according to the weather, we must say that the Constitution has behaved well. The Constitution is our framework for our democracy, and in that way the Constitution actually works very well. But there is a real danger that we are facing, and which the Constitution alone cannot ensure that we can fight against. And it is Islamism. The Islamists. The darkened people who want sharia. Who want the stoning of women. Who want polygamy. The darkened people, who for a certain part up to the last general election, last summer, argued that you should not use your right to vote. There was, among other things, an Islamist who said: <U+0094>To hell with the Constitution!<U+0094> It was quite terrifying, and those who might not have fully realized what dangers lurk, perhaps wised up and opened their eyes when this year they saw TV2's documentary broadcast <U+0094>Mosques behind the veil<U+0094>. It was a parallel society that was exposed to full blast, unfortunately. It was a documentary that was recorded with a hidden camera. And which showed that here in our lovely, beautiful country there are people who live in a medieval way of thinking. People who want Sharia law introduced in Denmark. People who are in favor of stoning women and polygamy, and who teach it to Muslims .All the things we don't want. Own legal societies, where you had to find out what was right and wrong. Warnings against contacting the police if you were the victim of violence. All the things we don't like .And at the same time, it is in these parallel societies, where extremism sprouts, that pure fanaticism develops, which also manifests itself in terrorism. We have seen it in Paris several times. We have seen it in Brussels. We have unfortunately seen it in Copenhagen. People who live in our own society. Grow up in our society and who develop an uncontrollable hatred for the same society that has otherwise given them everything. We must not put up with that. We must fight against it, and we must hit hard. And we must win the battle. We must do it primarily in two ways. One way is that we will have to say openly and honestly that we must have slowed down immigration, and we must especially have slowed down immigration from the Muslim world. We simply have to ensure that the tightening measures that have been made work, and there must be more. Since the general election this summer, we have made approximately 30 tightenings of the immigration rules. We have done it less attractive to apply to Denmark. So for migrants and asylum seekers. But quite frankly, we have made it more attractive to come to Denmark if you are a tourist. , they answer that they regard Denmark as a safe country. So that must be kept in mind in relation to discussions about reputation. Denmark's reputation in the world. There was a survey this morning that actually shows that there are more evaluates Denmark positively than before. You should probably try to remember that the people we are interested in talking to are the people who want to come to Denmark because they experience Denmark as a safe and secure country. A good place to travel there for himself and his family. And that, of course, requires us to be in control of things. And therefore it is good in all contexts that we ensure this through the austerities that are delivered. And that after a period of 3, 5 years, during which, according to the radical leader, Morten √òstergaard, it was the case that 45 relaxations of the immigration rules were delivered. I don't know if you remember last autumn, when we saw people walking on our motorways. The police came, and we thought , well, now things are coming to an end. People are getting off our highways and the cars can drive again. But no. The police came to keep the cars off so that people could safely walk on our highways, then they came running and said: <U+0094>Please, have some water!<U+0094>. I mean, that's really nice. This is the Danish welfare society at its very best. Would you like some water , because if you're going to go all the way to Sweden, you really need some water. And when evening came, we provided accommodation and food. The next morning, when they had had a good sleep and a little power on their iPhones, could they then wandered on towards the promised land, Sweden. That's how it actually happened last autumn. It's hard to believe. Basically, we should probably spend some time reflecting on what actually happened. People, who went through one peaceful country after another, and still wanted to claim to be refugees. But stop! When you go from one peaceful country to another, you are a migrant, an immigrant. Then you are no longer considered as a refugee. It's as simple as that. And this also applies to a Syrian in Ribe. So, if you have the human and financial resources to come all the way to Denmark, how can it be that as soon as you come to Denmark, you can you suddenly get nothing. Yes, of course you can fight to get your 20 children brought to Denmark. And I can understand that he has been given the right to get 17 of them to Denmark. Then there is a small good thing about them strictures we have introduced, namely that you now have to pay for family reunification yourself. You didn't have to do that until this summer. But it is clear that it is a bit paradoxical. Levakovic cannot be thrown out of Denmark because it is important, he is close to his children. I did not see him as the perfect role model for those children. But a Syrian who comes here has three wives and 20 children, he has to bring the children up here with one of the wives. So be it, unless he has been really busy, so it must almost be divided between the three women, so we are taking children away from their mother. What is the logic in that? Don't they have human rights in relation to being close to their mother? I think well, you can sometimes think about how in the world things are going. To avoid this quagmire where people wander from country to country. From one peaceful country to the next, thinking that then they should be considered refugees. Then, of course, we have to say stop. And there we have to ensure effective border control. It is, after all, very simple. If we look at what has happened since last autumn. Then it is the national border controls that have worked. It is not the EU that has worked. It is the countries that have started to implement border controls and that ensure protection against this free wave of immigration, migration, we saw. And I know very well that the outrage was great. Especially in relation to Hungary, when they started to say that a border is a border where we decide who can cross. And if we decide that, it also requires action. Many here can probably remember how the media made a pilgrimage down there to report back indignantly that they insisted that a border was a border that could be guarded and that people had to respect that border. But I want to - now I don't have a straw hat , and you have to be careful, it has to be boiled for quite a long time before it can be eaten - but the fact is that there are quite a few European countries, including Germany with Chancellor Merkel at the head, which otherwise gave way last autumn, as in today are happy that the Balkan route is closed. Who are happy that there are actually countries that introduced national border controls. the people who, as migrants, want to move from one peaceful country to another in order to come up here and share in our welfare. And that's why we don't stop until the border control is not called temporary, but called permanent. And is a real border control. That was one thing in relation to avoiding excessive immigration. The other is to fight the parallel societies that are already here. And of which we are sick and tired of. We saw it, as I mentioned, in TV2's documentary < U+0094>Mosques behind the veil<U+0094> for full coverage. We have also seen it in surveys. In a survey in August last year, yes, it appeared that four out of 10 Muslims in Denmark want the Koran to form the basis of Danish legislation. It is frightening, and it shows that 21 integration plans since 1999 have not helped. if you do more of the same, will it work? The number is too big. 21,200 came last year. With family reunification afterwards, it will be quite a few more. We have reduced the number that now comes to Denmark month after month, and that is of course good, but what about those who have already arrived? I think it is time we redefine what refugee policy really is. Refugee policy is, by its very nature, about helping people who are fleeing their homeland. In the temporary period that elapses until you can return again. That is fundamentally what refugee policy is all about. And Denmark must of course be known for being a country that helps people in need. People who had to flee their homeland because they cannot be there due to war and persecution. But there must never be any doubt that the intention is to help those people temporarily until they can return to their homeland again. And that's just it is precisely here that the other parties in the Folketing fail. As recently as last Friday, the day before yesterday, a very large majority decided to implement the so-called tripartite agreement. The tripartite agreement many of you have of course heard about. There must be some individuals who do not just heard about it, I would very much like to spend some time on this today. It is a tripartite agreement which means that you can now employ refugees and migrants who have come here, down to DKK 49 an hour. This is what we normally call wage dumping. Some people call it wage dumping, but it is wage dumping. And what is more remarkable is that when you are now employed in these jobs in the companies down to DKK 49 an hour, you earn unemployment benefits from day one &eacute. You earn unemployment benefit from day one, I said. You do. You think it's a lie. And that means when you've been in this course for the two years it's set for, you can go directly into the unemployment benefit system. And then you can be on unemployment benefit for the next two years. How do you tell these people who have come to Denmark, dear friends, that you are here temporarily? You will get help until you can return home, but You must return home. When the same society tells them, you should also know that you will enter the unemployment benefit system. Because basically we expect you to be here always. The point is that we very well know that if you don't go home voluntarily, then people have to be forcibly resettled, and this is done very rarely in practice, because it is difficult to get agreements with the home country about this. Of course you have to try to get that, but it is very important that people are mentally equipped with the idea that you are being helped temporarily, and that this is the way we behave towards these people. So they are never mentally in doubt that this is what is intended. That we provide skills based on what you need when you return. Not based on what it is like to be in Danish society to forever. And therefore it is completely in vain, to put it bluntly, that the Danish Parliament passes legislation on Friday which, after two years on low wages, gives access to the unemployment benefit system to all these people who came to Denmark last autumn. It gives quite simply no sense, and therefore we have to say to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen and Mette Frederiksen and the other parties who have voted for this agreement that this is the completely wrong way to go. After all, we have also made some agreements with Bertel Haarder, the minister of the church, in relation to combating parallel societies. And there are a number of good initiatives in those agreements. What one can then wonder about is that it has to wait until the autumn to get legislation made about it. Why not a big rush? You will nod in recognition of some of the rules. It is taking rights from religious communities that you can no longer maintain tax exemption. It may be that you no longer have the competence to marry. There are a number of such sensible things. What has been most talked about is, of course, the fight against preachers of violence. It has also been referred to as preachers of hate. Sharia law and the like. Just as we make a list of people that we do not want to bring to this country at all. And I know there are some who use today, Constitution Day, to say that these agreements are in conflict, or they would probably say, are on the verge of the Constitution, because it restricts freedom of expression. That is completely wrong. On the contrary, they follow the Constitution. You can put it this way that what we are exactly doing is to implement ¬ß 67 of the Constitution. ¬ß 67 of the Constitution states that citizens have the right to unite in society to worship God in a way that agrees with their beliefs, but that nothing is taught or done that is contrary to morality or public order order. However, that nothing is taught or done that is contrary to morality or public order. Have we seen in <U+0094>the mosques behind the veil<U+0094> that there is someone behaving in a way that is contrary to morality or public order? Yes, we probably have to say that we have. So that this should be on the edge or in conflict with the Basic Law - no, on the contrary <U+0096> it embodies a rule, a section of the Basic Law, which is precisely intended as an opportunity for us to set up some safeguards. And that is exactly what we are doing. And then I have to ask the same critics who are now so worried about what will happen next with freedom of speech Where were they when it came to Section 266b of the Criminal Code, the so-called racism clause. You know, the one that is used to beat people over the head to stop criticism of, among other things, the things that happen in Muslim societies. There was the criticism not there, but when it goes the other way, there will obviously be criticism. I just have to say <U+0096> we must not be naive. We must not be like the Alternative and the Unity List. The Alternative and the Unity List made it clear last week that they would roll back all the tightening of immigration laws if they are going to have influence after the next election. And I know that when it comes to the Alternative, that we can think it's a bit funny. A bit in jest and joking department. Especially when Uffe Elb√¶k says that we must have one meat-free day a week. I don't know if I'm revealing any secret when I say that he has given the impression that it must be Monday, because then we can eat a little extra during the weekend. But the fact is that it is also a party that says that we can easily take somewhere between 10,000 and 50,000 more refugees and migrants. And that's why I really just want to to say and remind Uffe Elb√¶k of something he himself said, that if we have to take 50,000 more: <U+0094>It is crazy!<U+0094> I know he said it in a different way, but I couldn't bring myself to do that. In a few weeks, it's St. Hansen. Many of us will go out to see bonfires and smell the breadcrumbs. But we will also be excited about the result from Great Britain. For June 23 the British vote. And it is actually very exciting. Regardless of whether it is a yes or no, there is actually perspective in the result. If they vote yes, then David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, will have his wish fulfilled and the negotiation results he has come up with home with, where the British have to decide more themselves and the EU less, it's going to happen. He gets an emergency brake on welfare benefits for migrant workers. He gets the right to differentiate the child check for people abroad. He gets a showdown with the Metockdom from 2008, which also undermined the Danish family reunification rules. So something has been brought home if they vote yes. But if they vote no, then it is actually also exciting. Perhaps you know this, but Venstre's political spokesman, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, has been over there to campaign for a yes vote. And there I just thought that if they now remember his father, the one with the socks, it may be that it will make the British vote no. A no will also open up some perspectives. It will be a shock to the entire EU system. It will once again emphasize that each whenever a population is asked about something to do with the EU, they say <U+0094>EU?<U+0096> No thanks<U+0094>. The EU just doesn't arouse enthusiasm. And it's fundamental, because the EU does not understand that we are Danes first and then we are Europeans. Just as the British are British first and then Europeans. Or the French are French first and then they are Europeans. So it does not come in the second order. And it can well, we almost forgot, but it wasn't long ago that there was someone who was <U+0094>european by heart<U+0094>. But it's a bit like bad weather yesterday, you forget the faster. Then you get on. But let me just say clearly and clearly that for me it is fairly clear that if the British are on their way out and the Turks are on their way in, then I know exactly where I want to be. Last year, here on Lykkesholm, we stood in the election campaign. We said we wanted a tighter immigration policy, we wanted a smaller EU. We said we wanted more and better welfare and that we wanted border control back. Yes today we can look back on a year that has just passed, when we got a tighter immigration policy, we got a no thanks on 3 December in relation to the legal reservation, we got more money this year set aside for care for the elderly and hospitals. And we have had a temporary grass control. So we are on our way, but we also know that of course we have to move on. There is so much we have to take care of here in our Denmark. There is unrest in the world. There are threats both from the outside and from the inside. And we have to fight them. But we have to remember why we have to fight them. Why? Yes, we have to because we have such a fantastic country. We have a Denmark that we love because it is arranged in a way that makes us proud, even when we look around the world. And then it is because we remember that what we have taken over as Danes did not come by itself. It is there someone who has built up before us. Someone who has toiled and toiled for. And if you have the necessary respect in relation to just that, then you also manage the Denmark that we have now been allowed to manage for a period of time, so we can proudly pass it on to the next generation. Which is still the most beautiful spot on earth. Which still houses the happiest people when you ask in opinion polls. Which still has cohesion and community. Which has not been broken down by parallel societies and the forces that want us to do something bad. Simply an obligation to take care of the good we have been given and hand it over in good condition. To do this, the Constitution is a magnificent framework, but it does not come by itself. It requires hard work and great support. That is why it is important today to talk about exactly that. I started my speech here by mentioning something about H.C. Andersen's fairy tale <U+0094>Twelve with the mail<U+0094>. In this fairy tale there is a captain who has to write down how each month has behaved. And when the year is over, he tells about the twelve months, and what the twelve months have brought us. He ends by saying: <U+0094>Now I don't know, and they probably don't know it either, <U+0096> because it's a strange time we live in< U+0094>. This fairy tale was first published in 1861, but the words could just as well be from today. It's a strange time we live in. Think, there are some who want the most beautiful things to live. But we promise each other that we will give them a fight to the finish line. We promise each other that we will give each other strength for just that. We do that, among other things, by being here this afternoon. May I ask you to stand up and together with me bring out a threefold life for today's birthdays, our lovely Constitution, the framework for everything we fight for and have fighting spirit for.

55588.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly letter <U+0096> Tuesday 7 June 2016 Kristian Thulesen Dahl's constitutional speech 2016 Our great poet H.C. Andersen came here on Lykkesholm. He was inspired for many of his great works on his travels. Among other things to write the fairy tale <U+0094>Twelve by post<U+0094>. A fairy tale about the turn of the year. The 12 months of the year. June is about the young lady. Young, fine, proud, pretty <U+0096> and generous! You have to say that Lykkesholm also shows its generous side today. And now we're talking about generosity. Then I'll just ask Have you remembered? That it is Father's Day today? You were also generous in showing up to our pig parties. Can recognize many of you. Approx. 1,800 over 3 Saturdays for roast suckling pig, jazz and draft beer. Those of you, those who did not participate must remember to come next time we do something similar. Today is the Constitution's birthday. And according to the weather, we must say that the Constitution has behaved well. The Constitution is our framework for our democracy, and in that way the Constitution actually works very well. But there is a real danger that we are facing, and which the Constitution alone cannot ensure that we can fight against. And it is Islamism. The Islamists. The darkened people who want sharia. Who want the stoning of women. Who want polygamy. The darkened people, who for a certain part up to the last general election, last summer, argued that you should not use your right to vote. There was, among other things, an Islamist who said: <U+0094>To hell with the Constitution!<U+0094> It was quite terrifying, and those who might not have fully realized what dangers lurk, perhaps wised up and opened their eyes when this year they saw TV2's documentary broadcast <U+0094>Mosques behind the veil<U+0094>. It was a parallel society that was exposed to full blast, unfortunately. It was a documentary that was recorded with a hidden camera. And which showed that here in our lovely, beautiful country there are people who live in a medieval way of thinking. People who want Sharia law introduced in Denmark. People who are in favor of stoning women and polygamy, and who teach it to Muslims .All the things we don't want. Own legal societies, where you had to find out what was right and wrong. Warnings against contacting the police if you were the victim of violence. All the things we don't like .And at the same time, it is in these parallel societies, where extremism sprouts, that pure fanaticism develops, which also manifests itself in terrorism. We have seen it in Paris several times. We have seen it in Brussels. We have unfortunately seen it in Copenhagen. People who live in our own society. Grow up in our society and who develop an uncontrollable hatred for the same society that has otherwise given them everything. We must not put up with that. We must fight against it, and we must hit hard. And we must win the battle. We must do it primarily in two ways. One way is that we will have to say openly and honestly that we must have slowed down immigration, and we must especially have slowed down immigration from the Muslim world. We simply have to ensure that the tightening measures that have been made work, and there must be more. Since the general election this summer, we have made approximately 30 tightenings of the immigration rules. We have done it less attractive to apply to Denmark. So for migrants and asylum seekers. But quite frankly, we have made it more attractive to come to Denmark if you are a tourist. , they answer that they regard Denmark as a safe country. So that must be kept in mind in relation to discussions about reputation. Denmark's reputation in the world. There was a survey this morning that actually shows that there are more evaluates Denmark positively than before. You should probably try to remember that the people we are interested in talking to are the people who want to come to Denmark because they experience Denmark as a safe and secure country. A good place to travel there for himself and his family. And that, of course, requires us to be in control of things. And therefore it is good in all contexts that we ensure this through the austerities that are delivered. And that after a period of 3, 5 years, during which, according to the radical leader, Morten √òstergaard, it was the case that 45 relaxations of the immigration rules were delivered. I don't know if you remember last autumn, when we saw people walking on our motorways. The police came, and we thought , well, now things are coming to an end. People are getting off our highways and the cars can drive again. But no. The police came to keep the cars off so that people could safely walk on our highways, then they came running and said: <U+0094>Please, have some water!<U+0094>. I mean, that's really nice. This is the Danish welfare society at its very best. Would you like some water , because if you're going to go all the way to Sweden, you really need some water. And when evening came, we provided accommodation and food. The next morning, when they had had a good sleep and a little power on their iPhones, could they then wandered on towards the promised land, Sweden. That's how it actually happened last autumn. It's hard to believe. Basically, we should probably spend some time reflecting on what actually happened. People, who went through one peaceful country after another, and still wanted to claim to be refugees. But stop! When you go from one peaceful country to another, you are a migrant, an immigrant. Then you are no longer considered as a refugee. It's as simple as that. And this also applies to a Syrian in Ribe. So, if you have the human and financial resources to come all the way to Denmark, how can it be that as soon as you come to Denmark, you can you suddenly get nothing. Yes, of course you can fight to get your 20 children brought to Denmark. And I can understand that he has been given the right to get 17 of them to Denmark. Then there is a small good thing about them strictures we have introduced, namely that you now have to pay for family reunification yourself. You didn't have to do that until this summer. But it is clear that it is a bit paradoxical. Levakovic cannot be thrown out of Denmark because it is important, he is close to his children. I did not see him as the perfect role model for those children. But a Syrian who comes here has three wives and 20 children, he has to bring the children up here with one of the wives. So be it, unless he has been really busy, so it must almost be divided between the three women, so we are taking children away from their mother. What is the logic in that? Don't they have human rights in relation to being close to their mother? I think well, you can sometimes think about how in the world things are going. To avoid this quagmire where people wander from country to country. From one peaceful country to the next, thinking that then they should be considered refugees. Then, of course, we have to say stop. And there we have to ensure effective border control. It is, after all, very simple. If we look at what has happened since last autumn. Then it is the national border controls that have worked. It is not the EU that has worked. It is the countries that have started to implement border controls and that ensure protection against this free wave of immigration, migration, we saw. And I know very well that the outrage was great. Especially in relation to Hungary, when they started to say that a border is a border where we decide who can cross. And if we decide that, it also requires action. Many here can probably remember how the media made a pilgrimage down there to report back indignantly that they insisted that a border was a border that could be guarded and that people had to respect that border. But I want to - now I don't have a straw hat , and you have to be careful, it has to be boiled for quite a long time before it can be eaten - but the fact is that there are quite a few European countries, including Germany with Chancellor Merkel at the head, which otherwise gave way last autumn, as in today are happy that the Balkan route is closed. Who are happy that there are actually countries that introduced national border controls. the people who, as migrants, want to move from one peaceful country to another in order to come up here and share in our welfare. And that's why we don't stop until the border control is not called temporary, but called permanent. And is a real border control. That was one thing in relation to avoiding excessive immigration. The other is to fight the parallel societies that are already here. And of which we are sick and tired of. We saw it, as I mentioned, in TV2's documentary < U+0094>Mosques behind the veil<U+0094> for full coverage. We have also seen it in surveys. In a survey in August last year, yes, it appeared that four out of 10 Muslims in Denmark want the Koran to form the basis of Danish legislation. It is frightening, and it shows that 21 integration plans since 1999 have not helped. if you do more of the same, will it work? The number is too big. 21,200 came last year. With family reunification afterwards, it will be quite a few more. We have reduced the number that now comes to Denmark month after month, and that is of course good, but what about those who have already arrived? I think it is time we redefine what refugee policy really is. Refugee policy is, by its very nature, about helping people who are fleeing their homeland. In the temporary period that elapses until you can return again. That is fundamentally what refugee policy is all about. And Denmark must of course be known for being a country that helps people in need. People who had to flee their homeland because they cannot be there due to war and persecution. But there must never be any doubt that the intention is to help those people temporarily until they can return to their homeland again. And that's just it is precisely here that the other parties in the Folketing fail. As recently as last Friday, the day before yesterday, a very large majority decided to implement the so-called tripartite agreement. The tripartite agreement many of you have of course heard about. There must be some individuals who do not just heard about it, I would very much like to spend some time on this today. It is a tripartite agreement which means that you can now employ refugees and migrants who have come here, down to DKK 49 an hour. This is what we normally call wage dumping. Some people call it wage dumping, but it is wage dumping. And what is more remarkable is that when you are now employed in these jobs in the companies down to DKK 49 an hour, you earn unemployment benefits from day one &eacute. You earn unemployment benefit from day one, I said. You do. You think it's a lie. And that means when you've been in this course for the two years it's set for, you can go directly into the unemployment benefit system. And then you can be on unemployment benefit for the next two years. How do you tell these people who have come to Denmark, dear friends, that you are here temporarily? You will get help until you can return home, but You must return home. When the same society tells them, you should also know that you will enter the unemployment benefit system. Because basically we expect you to be here always. The point is that we very well know that if you don't go home voluntarily, then people have to be forcibly resettled, and this is done very rarely in practice, because it is difficult to get agreements with the home country about this. Of course you have to try to get that, but it is very important that people are mentally equipped with the idea that you are being helped temporarily, and that this is the way we behave towards these people. So they are never mentally in doubt that this is what is intended. That we provide skills based on what you need when you return. Not based on what it is like to be in Danish society to forever. And therefore it is completely in vain, to put it bluntly, that the Danish Parliament passes legislation on Friday which, after two years on low wages, gives access to the unemployment benefit system to all these people who came to Denmark last autumn. It gives quite simply no sense, and therefore we have to say to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen and Mette Frederiksen and the other parties who have voted for this agreement that this is the completely wrong way to go. After all, we have also made some agreements with Bertel Haarder, the minister of the church, in relation to combating parallel societies. And there are a number of good initiatives in those agreements. What one can then wonder about is that it has to wait until the autumn to get legislation made about it. Why not a big rush? You will nod in recognition of some of the rules. It is taking rights from religious communities that you can no longer maintain tax exemption. It may be that you no longer have the competence to marry. There are a number of such sensible things. What has been most talked about is, of course, the fight against preachers of violence. It has also been referred to as preachers of hate. Sharia law and the like. Just as we make a list of people that we do not want to bring to this country at all.

And now we're talking about generosity. Then I'll just ask Have you remembered? That it is Father's Day today? You were also generous in showing up to our pig parties. Can recognize many of you. Approx. 1,800 over 3 Saturdays for roast suckling pig, jazz and draft beer. Those of you, those who did not participate must remember to come next time we do something similar. Today is the Constitution's birthday. And according to the weather, we must say that the Constitution has behaved well. The Constitution is our framework for our democracy, and in that way the Constitution actually works very well. But there is a real danger that we are facing, and which the Constitution alone cannot ensure that we can fight against. And it is Islamism. The Islamists. The darkened people who want sharia. Who want the stoning of women. Who want polygamy. The darkened people, who for a certain part up to the last general election, last summer, argued that you should not use your right to vote. There was, among other things, an Islamist who said: <U+0094>To hell with the Constitution!<U+0094> It was quite terrifying, and those who might not have fully realized what dangers lurk, perhaps wised up and opened their eyes when this year they saw TV2's documentary broadcast <U+0094>Mosques behind the veil<U+0094>. It was a parallel society that was exposed to full blast, unfortunately. It was a documentary that was recorded with a hidden camera. And which showed that here in our lovely, beautiful country there are people who live in a medieval way of thinking. People who want Sharia law introduced in Denmark. People who are in favor of stoning women and polygamy, and who teach it to Muslims .All the things we don't want. Own legal societies, where you had to find out what was right and wrong. Warnings against contacting the police if you were the victim of violence. All the things we don't like .And at the same time, it is in these parallel societies, where extremism sprouts, that pure fanaticism develops, which also manifests itself in terrorism. We have seen it in Paris several times. We have seen it in Brussels. We have unfortunately seen it in Copenhagen. People who live in our own society. Grow up in our society and who develop an uncontrollable hatred for the same society that has otherwise given them everything. We must not put up with that. We must fight against it, and we must hit hard. And we must win the battle. We must do it primarily in two ways. One way is that we will have to say openly and honestly that we must have slowed down immigration, and we must especially have slowed down immigration from the Muslim world. We simply have to ensure that the tightening measures that have been made work, and there must be more. Since the general election this summer, we have made approximately 30 tightenings of the immigration rules. We have done it less attractive to apply to Denmark. So for migrants and asylum seekers. But quite frankly, we have made it more attractive to come to Denmark if you are a tourist. , they answer that they regard Denmark as a safe country. So that must be kept in mind in relation to discussions about reputation. Denmark's reputation in the world. There was a survey this morning that actually shows that there are more evaluates Denmark positively than before. You should probably try to remember that the people we are interested in talking to are the people who want to come to Denmark because they experience Denmark as a safe and secure country. A good place to travel there for himself and his family. And that, of course, requires us to be in control of things. And therefore it is good in all contexts that we ensure this through the austerities that are delivered. And that after a period of 3, 5 years, during which, according to the radical leader, Morten √òstergaard, it was the case that 45 relaxations of the immigration rules were delivered. I don't know if you remember last autumn, when we saw people walking on our motorways. The police came, and we thought , well, now things are coming to an end. People are getting off our highways and the cars can drive again. But no. The police came to keep the cars off so that people could safely walk on our highways, then they came running and said: <U+0094>Please, have some water!<U+0094>. I mean, that's really nice. This is the Danish welfare society at its very best. Would you like some water , because if you're going to go all the way to Sweden, you really need some water. And when evening came, we provided accommodation and food. The next morning, when they had had a good sleep and a little power on their iPhones, could they then wandered on towards the promised land, Sweden. That's how it actually happened last autumn. It's hard to believe. Basically, we should probably spend some time reflecting on what actually happened. People, who went through one peaceful country after another, and still wanted to claim to be refugees. But stop! When you go from one peaceful country to another, you are a migrant, an immigrant. Then you are no longer considered as a refugee. It's as simple as that. And this also applies to a Syrian in Ribe. So, if you have the human and financial resources to come all the way to Denmark, how can it be that as soon as you come to Denmark, you can you suddenly get nothing. Yes, of course you can fight to get your 20 children brought to Denmark. And I can understand that he has been given the right to get 17 of them to Denmark. Then there is a small good thing about them strictures we have introduced, namely that you now have to pay for family reunification yourself. You didn't have to do that until this summer. But it is clear that it is a bit paradoxical. Levakovic cannot be thrown out of Denmark because it is important, he is close to his children. I did not see him as the perfect role model for those children. But a Syrian who comes here has three wives and 20 children, he has to bring the children up here with one of the wives. So be it, unless he has been really busy, so it must almost be divided between the three women, so we are taking children away from their mother. What is the logic in that? Don't they have human rights in relation to being close to their mother? I think well, you can sometimes think about how in the world things are going. To avoid this quagmire where people wander from country to country. From one peaceful country to the next, thinking that then they should be considered refugees. Then, of course, we have to say stop. And there we have to ensure effective border control. It is, after all, very simple. If we look at what has happened since last autumn. Then it is the national border controls that have worked. It is not the EU that has worked. It is the countries that have started to implement border controls and that ensure protection against this free wave of immigration, migration, we saw. And I know very well that the outrage was great. Especially in relation to Hungary, when they started to say that a border is a border where we decide who can cross. And if we decide that, it also requires action. Many here can probably remember how the media made a pilgrimage down there to report back indignantly that they insisted that a border was a border that could be guarded and that people had to respect that border. But I want to - now I don't have a straw hat , and you have to be careful, it has to be boiled for quite a long time before it can be eaten - but the fact is that there are quite a few European countries, including Germany with Chancellor Merkel at the head, which otherwise gave way last autumn, as in today are happy that the Balkan route is closed. Who are happy that there are actually countries that introduced national border controls. the people who, as migrants, want to move from one peaceful country to another in order to come up here and share in our welfare. And that's why we don't stop until the border control is not called temporary, but called permanent. And is a real border control. That was one thing in relation to avoiding excessive immigration. The other is to fight the parallel societies that are already here. And of which we are sick and tired of. We saw it, as I mentioned, in TV2's documentary < U+0094>Mosques behind the veil<U+0094> for full coverage. We have also seen it in surveys. In a survey in August last year, yes, it appeared that four out of 10 Muslims in Denmark want the Koran to form the basis of Danish legislation. It is frightening, and it shows that 21 integration plans since 1999 have not helped. if you do more of the same, will it work? The number is too big. 21,200 came last year. With family reunification afterwards, it will be quite a few more. We have reduced the number that now comes to Denmark month after month, and that is of course good, but what about those who have already arrived? I think it is time we redefine what refugee policy really is. Refugee policy is, by its very nature, about helping people who are fleeing their homeland. In the temporary period that elapses until you can return again. That is fundamentally what refugee policy is all about. And Denmark must of course be known for being a country that helps people in need. People who had to flee their homeland because they cannot be there due to war and persecution. But there must never be any doubt that the intention is to help those people temporarily until they can return to their homeland again. And that's just it is precisely here that the other parties in the Folketing fail. As recently as last Friday, the day before yesterday, a very large majority decided to implement the so-called tripartite agreement. The tripartite agreement many of you have of course heard about. There must be some individuals who do not just heard about it, I would very much like to spend some time on this today. It is a tripartite agreement which means that you can now employ refugees and migrants who have come here, down to DKK 49 an hour. This is what we normally call wage dumping. Some people call it wage dumping, but it is wage dumping. And what is more remarkable is that when you are now employed in these jobs in the companies down to DKK 49 an hour, you earn unemployment benefits from day one &eacute. You earn unemployment benefit from day one, I said. You do. You think it's a lie. And that means when you've been in this course for the two years it's set for, you can go directly into the unemployment benefit system. And then you can be on unemployment benefit for the next two years. How do you tell these people who have come to Denmark, dear friends, that you are here temporarily? You will get help until you can return home, but You must return home. When the same society tells them, you should also know that you will enter the unemployment benefit system. Because basically we expect you to be here always. The point is that we very well know that if you don't go home voluntarily, then people have to be forcibly resettled, and this is done very rarely in practice, because it is difficult to get agreements with the home country about this. Of course you have to try to get that, but it is very important that people are mentally equipped with the idea that you are being helped temporarily, and that this is the way we behave towards these people. So they are never mentally in doubt that this is what is intended. That we provide skills based on what you need when you return. Not based on what it is like to be in Danish society to forever. And therefore it is completely in vain, to put it bluntly, that the Danish Parliament passes legislation on Friday which, after two years on low wages, gives access to the unemployment benefit system to all these people who came to Denmark last autumn. It gives quite simply no sense, and therefore we have to say to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen and Mette Frederiksen and the other parties who have voted for this agreement that this is the completely wrong way to go. After all, we have also made some agreements with Bertel Haarder, the minister of the church, in relation to combating parallel societies. And there are a number of good initiatives in those agreements. What one can then wonder about is that it has to wait until the autumn to get legislation made about it. Why not a big rush? You will nod in recognition of some of the rules. It is taking rights from religious communities that you can no longer maintain tax exemption. It may be that you no longer have the competence to marry. There are a number of such sensible things. What has been most talked about is, of course, the fight against preachers of violence. It has also been referred to as preachers of hate. Sharia law and the like. Just as we make a list of people that we do not want to bring to this country at all. And I know there are some who use today, Constitution Day, to say that these agreements are in conflict, or they would probably say, are on the verge of the Constitution, because it restricts freedom of expression. That is completely wrong. On the contrary, they follow the Constitution. You can put it this way that what we are exactly doing is to implement ¬ß 67 of the Constitution. ¬ß 67 of the Constitution states that citizens have the right to unite in society to worship God in a way that agrees with their beliefs, but that nothing is taught or done that is contrary to morality or public order order. However, that nothing is taught or done that is contrary to morality or public order. Have we seen in <U+0094>the mosques behind the veil<U+0094> that there is someone behaving in a way that is contrary to morality or public order? Yes, we probably have to say that we have. So that this should be on the edge or in conflict with the Basic Law - no, on the contrary <U+0096> it embodies a rule, a section of the Basic Law, which is precisely intended as an opportunity for us to set up some safeguards. And that is exactly what we are doing. And then I have to ask the same critics who are now so worried about what will happen next with freedom of speech Where were they when it came to Section 266b of the Criminal Code, the so-called racism clause. You know, the one that is used to beat people over the head to stop criticism of, among other things, the things that happen in Muslim societies. There was the criticism not there, but when it goes the other way, there will obviously be criticism. I just have to say <U+0096> we must not be naive. We must not be like the Alternative and the Unity List. The Alternative and the Unity List made it clear last week that they would roll back all the tightening of immigration laws if they are going to have influence after the next election. And I know that when it comes to the Alternative, that we can think it's a bit funny. A bit in jest and joking department. Especially when Uffe Elb√¶k says that we must have one meat-free day a week. I don't know if I'm revealing any secret when I say that he has given the impression that it must be Monday, because then we can eat a little extra during the weekend. But the fact is that it is also a party that says that we can easily take somewhere between 10,000 and 50,000 more refugees and migrants. And that's why I really just want to to say and remind Uffe Elb√¶k of something he himself said, that if we have to take 50,000 more: <U+0094>It is crazy!<U+0094> I know he said it in a different way, but I couldn't bring myself to do that. In a few weeks, it's St. Hansen. Many of us will go out to see bonfires and smell the breadcrumbs. But we will also be excited about the result from Great Britain. For June 23 the British vote. And it is actually very exciting. Regardless of whether it is a yes or no, there is actually perspective in the result. If they vote yes, then David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, will have his wish fulfilled and the negotiation results he has come up with home with, where the British have to decide more themselves and the EU less, it's going to happen. He gets an emergency brake on welfare benefits for migrant workers. He gets the right to differentiate the child check for people abroad. He gets a showdown with the Metockdom from 2008, which also undermined the Danish family reunification rules. So something has been brought home if they vote yes. But if they vote no, then it is actually also exciting. Perhaps you know this, but Venstre's political spokesman, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, has been over there to campaign for a yes vote. And there I just thought that if they now remember his father, the one with the socks, it may be that it will make the British vote no. A no will also open up some perspectives. It will be a shock to the entire EU system. It will once again emphasize that each whenever a population is asked about something to do with the EU, they say <U+0094>EU?<U+0096> No thanks<U+0094>. The EU just doesn't arouse enthusiasm. And it's fundamental, because the EU does not understand that we are Danes first and then we are Europeans. Just as the British are British first and then Europeans. Or the French are French first and then they are Europeans. So it does not come in the second order. And it can well, we almost forgot, but it wasn't long ago that there was someone who was <U+0094>european by heart<U+0094>. But it's a bit like bad weather yesterday, you forget the faster. Then you get on. But let me just say clearly and clearly that for me it is fairly clear that if the British are on their way out and the Turks are on their way in, then I know exactly where I want to be. Last year, here on Lykkesholm, we stood in the election campaign. We said we wanted a tighter immigration policy, we wanted a smaller EU. We said we wanted more and better welfare and that we wanted border control back. Yes today we can look back on a year that has just passed, when we got a tighter immigration policy, we got a no thanks on 3 December in relation to the legal reservation, we got more money this year set aside for care for the elderly and hospitals. And we have had a temporary grass control. So we are on our way, but we also know that of course we have to move on. There is so much we have to take care of here in our Denmark. There is unrest in the world. There are threats both from the outside and from the inside. And we have to fight them. But we have to remember why we have to fight them. Why? Yes, we have to because we have such a fantastic country. We have a Denmark that we love because it is arranged in a way that makes us proud, even when we look around the world. And then it is because we remember that what we have taken over as Danes did not come by itself. It is there someone who has built up before us. Someone who has toiled and toiled for. And if you have the necessary respect in relation to just that, then you also manage the Denmark that we have now been allowed to manage for a period of time, so we can proudly pass it on to the next generation. Which is still the most beautiful spot on earth. Which still houses the happiest people when you ask in opinion polls. Which still has cohesion and community. Which has not been broken down by parallel societies and the forces that want us to do something bad. Simply an obligation to take care of the good we have been given and hand it over in good condition. To do this, the Constitution is a magnificent framework, but it does not come by itself. It requires hard work and great support. That is why it is important today to talk about exactly that. I started my speech here by mentioning something about H.C. Andersen's fairy tale <U+0094>Twelve with the mail<U+0094>. In this fairy tale there is a captain who has to write down how each month has behaved. And when the year is over, he tells about the twelve months, and what the twelve months have brought us. He ends by saying: <U+0094>Now I don't know, and they probably don't know it either, <U+0096> because it's a strange time we live in< U+0094>. This fairy tale was first published in 1861, but the words could just as well be from today. It's a strange time we live in. Think, there are some who want the most beautiful things to live. But we promise each other that we will give them a fight to the finish line. We promise each other that we will give each other strength for just that. We do that, among other things, by being here this afternoon. May I ask you to stand up and together with me bring out a threefold life for today's birthdays, our lovely Constitution, the framework for everything we fight for and have fighting spirit for.

So they are never mentally in doubt that this is what is intended. That we provide skills based on what you need when you return. Not based on what it is like to be in Danish society to forever. And therefore it is completely in vain, to put it bluntly, that the Danish Parliament passes legislation on Friday which, after two years on low wages, gives access to the unemployment benefit system to all these people who came to Denmark last autumn. It gives quite simply no sense, and therefore we have to say to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen and Mette Frederiksen and the other parties who have voted for this agreement that this is the completely wrong way to go. After all, we have also made some agreements with Bertel Haarder, the minister of the church, in relation to combating parallel societies. And there are a number of good initiatives in those agreements. What one can then wonder about is that it has to wait until the autumn to get legislation made about it. Why not a big rush? You will nod in recognition of some of the rules. It is taking rights from religious communities that you can no longer maintain tax exemption. It may be that you no longer have the competence to marry. There are a number of such sensible things. What has been most talked about is, of course, the fight against preachers of violence. It has also been referred to as preachers of hate. Sharia law and the like. Just as we make a list of people that we do not want to bring to this country at all. And I know there are some who use today, Constitution Day, to say that these agreements are in conflict, or they would probably say, are on the verge of the Constitution, because it restricts freedom of expression. That is completely wrong. On the contrary, they follow the Constitution. You can put it this way that what we are exactly doing is to implement ¬ß 67 of the Constitution. ¬ß 67 of the Constitution states that citizens have the right to unite in society to worship God in a way that agrees with their beliefs, but that nothing is taught or done that is contrary to morality or public order order. However, that nothing is taught or done that is contrary to morality or public order. Have we seen in <U+0094>the mosques behind the veil<U+0094> that there is someone behaving in a way that is contrary to morality or public order? Yes, we probably have to say that we have. So that this should be on the edge or in conflict with the Basic Law - no, on the contrary <U+0096> it embodies a rule, a section of the Basic Law, which is precisely intended as an opportunity for us to set up some safeguards. And that is exactly what we are doing. And then I have to ask the same critics who are now so worried about what will happen next with freedom of speech Where were they when it came to Section 266b of the Criminal Code, the so-called racism clause. You know, the one that is used to beat people over the head to stop criticism of, among other things, the things that happen in Muslim societies. There was the criticism not there, but when it goes the other way, there will obviously be criticism. I just have to say <U+0096> we must not be naive. We must not be like the Alternative and the Unity List. The Alternative and the Unity List made it clear last week that they would roll back all the tightening of immigration laws if they are going to have influence after the next election. And I know that when it comes to the Alternative, that we can think it's a bit funny. A bit in jest and joking department. Especially when Uffe Elb√¶k says that we must have one meat-free day a week. I don't know if I'm revealing any secret when I say that he has given the impression that it must be Monday, because then we can eat a little extra during the weekend. But the fact is that it is also a party that says that we can easily take somewhere between 10,000 and 50,000 more refugees and migrants. And that's why I really just want to to say and remind Uffe Elb√¶k of something he himself said, that if we have to take 50,000 more: <U+0094>It is crazy!<U+0094> I know he said it in a different way, but I couldn't bring myself to do that. In a few weeks, it's St. Hansen. Many of us will go out to see bonfires and smell the breadcrumbs. But we will also be excited about the result from Great Britain. For June 23 the British vote. And it is actually very exciting. Regardless of whether it is a yes or no, there is actually perspective in the result. If they vote yes, then David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, will have his wish fulfilled and the negotiation results he has come up with home with, where the British have to decide more themselves and the EU less, it's going to happen. He gets an emergency brake on welfare benefits for migrant workers. He gets the right to differentiate the child check for people abroad. He gets a showdown with the Metockdom from 2008, which also undermined the Danish family reunification rules. So something has been brought home if they vote yes. But if they vote no, then it is actually also exciting. Perhaps you know this, but Venstre's political spokesman, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, has been over there to campaign for a yes vote. And there I just thought that if they now remember his father, the one with the socks, it may be that it will make the British vote no. A no will also open up some perspectives. It will be a shock to the entire EU system. It will once again emphasize that each whenever a population is asked about something to do with the EU, they say <U+0094>EU?<U+0096> No thanks<U+0094>. The EU just doesn't arouse enthusiasm. And it's fundamental, because the EU does not understand that we are Danes first and then we are Europeans. Just as the British are British first and then Europeans. Or the French are French first and then they are Europeans. So it does not come in the second order. And it can well, we almost forgot, but it wasn't long ago that there was someone who was <U+0094>european by heart<U+0094>. But it's a bit like bad weather yesterday, you forget the faster. Then you get on. But let me just say clearly and clearly that for me it is fairly clear that if the British are on their way out and the Turks are on their way in, then I know exactly where I want to be. Last year, here on Lykkesholm, we stood in the election campaign. We said we wanted a tighter immigration policy, we wanted a smaller EU. We said we wanted more and better welfare and that we wanted border control back. Yes today we can look back on a year that has just passed, when we got a tighter immigration policy, we got a no thanks on 3 December in relation to the legal reservation, we got more money this year set aside for care for the elderly and hospitals. And we have had a temporary grass control. So we are on our way, but we also know that of course we have to move on. There is so much we have to take care of here in our Denmark. There is unrest in the world. There are threats both from the outside and from the inside. And we have to fight them. But we have to remember why we have to fight them. Why? Yes, we have to because we have such a fantastic country. We have a Denmark that we love because it is arranged in a way that makes us proud, even when we look around the world. And then it is because we remember that what we have taken over as Danes did not come by itself. It is there someone who has built up before us. Someone who has toiled and toiled for. And if you have the necessary respect in relation to just that, then you also manage the Denmark that we have now been allowed to manage for a period of time, so we can proudly pass it on to the next generation. Which is still the most beautiful spot on earth. Which still houses the happiest people when you ask in opinion polls. Which still has cohesion and community. Which has not been broken down by parallel societies and the forces that want us to do something bad. Simply an obligation to take care of the good we have been given and hand it over in good condition. To do this, the Constitution is a magnificent framework, but it does not come by itself. It requires hard work and great support. That is why it is important today to talk about exactly that. I started my speech here by mentioning something about H.C. Andersen's fairy tale <U+0094>Twelve with the mail<U+0094>. In this fairy tale there is a captain who has to write down how each month has behaved. And when the year is over, he tells about the twelve months, and what the twelve months have brought us. He ends by saying: <U+0094>Now I don't know, and they probably don't know it either, <U+0096> because it's a strange time we live in< U+0094>. This fairy tale was first published in 1861, but the words could just as well be from today. It's a strange time we live in. Think, there are some who want the most beautiful things to live. But we promise each other that we will give them a fight to the finish line. We promise each other that we will give each other strength for just that. We do that, among other things, by being here this afternoon. May I ask you to stand up and together with me bring out a threefold life for today's birthdays, our lovely Constitution, the framework for everything we fight for and have fighting spirit for.

56525.0," [The spoken word applies]Do we want a society where you are the maker of your own luck, where everyone stands alone and each of us is easy to blow over? Or do we want a society where no one is left to fend for themselves, where we help each other and where we stand close together so we have something to stand against? Right now we have a government that pulls in one direction. I probably don't need to tell you which one. But luckily there are many of us who pull in the exact opposite direction. In the direction of more community. And you know what? It's good to stand together. On the first of May last year, we talked a lot about a company called Uber. They were well on their way to undermining the taxi drivers' working conditions. Now they are well into the process of packing up their offices. Uber has given up. It is the result of joint pressure from everyone who fights for decent working conditions. Joachim B. Olsen is of course sad that Uber is closing. Because he thinks it's so new and exciting. My God, I can see they've made an app. But their business is based on wage printing, casual labor and zero social security. It is not new and exciting, it is old fashioned. Dear friends, this is why we must fight together. Because together we can make sure that this kind of working relationship never becomes modern again.***It is necessary. Because we see the relationships of old times creeping back in many areas. 16 horticultural employees on Funen are fired after several years with the company. And a few days later, a temp agency starts work with foreign employees at DKK 45 an hour. Companies that build the metro in Copenhagen for Danish tax dollars make their employees work 55 hours a week, but only pay them for 37. And one in three foreign companies have such a bad working environment that the Norwegian Labor Inspectorate shuts them down. But when people work in Denmark, while they get paid and pay taxes like in an Eastern European country, then someone is scoring the coffers. And believe me. It is not the Latvian truck driver. It is not the Polish carpenter. Behind every eastern worker stands an employer. It is towards the employers that we must collectively set a limit. Employers who can't figure it out with fair and equal conditions may want to find another place to do business. Because whether you come from Poland or Vejle, in Denmark we fight for everyone to work on the same terms. Fair conditions.***But the EU stands in the way of equal conditions. What the EU calls freedom and free movement is in reality freedom for employers and a straitjacket for employees. Employers are given the freedom to say no to collective agreements and shop around Europe thinly for the cheapest labour. The wage earners, on the other hand, are stopped by EU rules when they want to demand employment contracts and come into conflict with the employers who exploit people. My and Enhedslisten's position is clear. In Denmark, we must go all the way to protect our labor market against social dumping. Even if it means a fight with the EU. We will gladly accept that.***The government we have in Denmark right now, L√∏kke, Pape and Samuelsen, they certainly do not get up every morning and think: What can we do today to strengthen the community? Just as an example : At the beginning of the year, I asked Lars L√∏kke about the increasing inequality. He got a slightly distant look in his eyes as he shrugged his shoulders and said: ""Denmark does not have an inequality problem"". But dear Prime Minister. We have that. Inequality does not just cover the fact that some have received more, but also that a great many have received less. And a few weeks ago we could read that the number of poor people in Denmark has doubled since 2002. To this, one of Venstre's members of parliament said , that the explanation could be that perhaps there had simply been more self-employed people who did not earn as much yet. So what they are saying is that even though successive governments have for several decades deteriorated the unemployment benefit system and introduced poverty benefits, when the government's own figures show , that more children have to grow up poor, and a record number of people seek Christmas help every year, then it's all probably just because thousands of people are living out their entrepreneurial dream. It's not just too stupid. It is also extremely far from reality. The increasing inequality is creating a more insecure society for all of us. Everyone who has tried to get a notice of dismissal, everyone who has friends and family members who have been affected by illness knows this. You know that we can all use the community. And we must not allow them to pretend that inequality is not a problem. We must move closer together so we can shout even louder. In a rich country like Denmark, children should not grow up in poverty. In a rich country like Denmark, poverty must be a thing of the past. In a rich country like Denmark, security must be for everyone.***Unfortunately, it is not only the politics of the right wing that has created poverty and more insecurity for ordinary people. The Social Democrats, SF and the Radicals also did this when they had government power. They reduced cash benefits for young people. They made a reform of the early retirement pension that has left many in a desperate situation. They did a tax reform that took from retirees, the sick and the unemployed to give to those who already have the most. Don't get me wrong. I am also happy about the good we did together and that we can now come together to criticize the antisocial politics of the right wing. It is so important for so many. But dear friends in the three parties: We should also be able to get together to clean up after your own reforms that have contributed to poverty, inequality and insecurity. You must say clearly that those reforms must go the same way as the current government's cash assistance cap: In the dustbin.***But we need more than that. We must also bring security back to our nurseries and kindergartens, to our care homes and hospitals. I was recently talking to an old friend, a new mother. She had to drop her little daughter off at daycare for the first time, but she wasn't excited and was looking forward to getting back to work. No, she was worried, actually had a stomach ache, because she was afraid that there weren't enough educators in the new nursery. But parents shouldn't have a stomach ache when they drop their children off at the institution. No one should leave a visit to the grandparents with a lump in their throat because they are not sure if there is enough help. And neither SOSUs, midwives, doctors or nurses should feel bad when they finish a shift. Our welfare should give us security, not a guilty conscience. No, in fact the only ones who should have a guilty conscience are the politicians who, year after year, suck billions out of our welfare. The good news is that there are elections for city councils and regions throughout the country this autumn. And here we can change direction by going down and voting. We need to send a clear message to all local politicians in this country: When the government knocks on your door with their catalog of more pointless cuts, do what you do with an annoying door salesman: Say no clearly, say goodbye politely and slam the door i.***That's really the message to all of us here on May Day. We shouldn't fall for flat salesman tricks. We must not believe the government and its friends when they say that they cannot afford welfare, cannot afford to provide a decent everyday life for people affected by illness or unemployment, cannot afford reasonable conditions in the workplace. We must remember that it is a choice. Whether the money in the common fund should be squandered away on tax rebates for the few at the top. Or whether we would rather invest in security and opportunities for all the rest of us. In a strong common welfare. In a green transition, so that the planet can also be a good home for our children and grandchildren. And then we must never ever forget our common strength. We must never forget that we can stand firm when we stand together. A very happy May Day.

53853.0," Most recently, the prime minister even used the disgusting act of terrorism in Copenhagen to say in Politiken that terrorists will have an easier time if the Danes do not vote <U+0094>yes<U+0094> to remove the reservation of rights by that time. A rather significant message and a way of trying to threaten the Danes into a <U+0094>yes<U+0094>. We've seen it before. In all the previous EU referendums on handing over sovereignty, it has been used: If the Danes do not vote for more EU, then all sorts of misfortunes await! This time it is safe to say that it is even more serious. The chairman of the Social Democratic Party clearly says that if we don't vote as she wants, then we have no <U+0094>effective protection against terror<U+0094>. That must send a chill down anyone's spine! But whoa! The vote on the reservation of rights does not have to take place until some time into 2016, but by that time the Europol cooperation has already changed according to the plan. According to the prime minister, Denmark will therefore for a period of time be outside the cooperation which, in her own words, is an <U+0094>effective defense against terror<U+0094>. So: The government's policy means that Denmark will be outside the Europol cooperation and the effective protection against terror for a period of time! How on earth can the supporter parties take responsibility for that? Thus giving terrorists an easier game? You get the suspicion that it's not about that at all. But, on the other hand, generally getting rid of an annoying reservation of rights. Because otherwise you could do something else: You could make a bilateral agreement between Denmark and the EU on Europol <U+0096> a so-called parallel agreement. And thus solve the case. Both Switzerland and Norway have such an agreement, but the government has consistently refused to even attempt to make such an agreement. Why? What could be the motive other than to use the terrible situation as leverage for something more general <U+0096> to get the reservation completely removed? Do they see here the golden opportunity they have been waiting for? If so, it will be a cold and extremely cynical calculation, the government and others. then conducts. If you follow the prime minister's own logic, it even helps to create a greater threat to Denmark! Put bluntly, one must ask if the Prime Minister is gambling with the security of the Danes? The Danish People's Party is of the opinion that we must participate in Europol cooperation, and that this must be done through a parallel agreement. We must not give a majority in the Danish Parliament the opportunity to join a common EU asylum policy! There is a high probability that the Danes will emphasize this in the upcoming referendum. Will make it clear to the politicians in Christiansborg that there is a limit to what the EU must interfere in. That the Danes simply say no thanks! After that, a parallel agreement can be concluded, and Denmark will then rejoin Europol. But the government and its supporters must in that situation take responsibility for the fact that there may be a period when Denmark is outside. One and only because the consideration of an arm-laying with the reservation of rights more generally weighs more heavily for the prime minister than if Denmark is retained in Europol. D&eacute is the thought-provoking in relation to the statements from the prime minister about the consequences of being outside, which we have heard. Of course, it will not be what we will hear from the <U+0094>yes<U+0094> parties up against the vote. It will be a scare campaign of another world, where Denmark and the safety of the Danes will be threatened if it is not a <U+0094>yes<U+0094>. But it will sound hollow <U+0096> and fool me if the Danes can't hear how false the <U+0094>yes<U+0094> parties' song is basically.

55283.0," Last week's debate on gender-separated parent meetings at Holbergskolen in Copenhagen's North-West quarter has once again clearly exposed the left's difficult dilemma in relation to demands for special treatment for Muslims. As soon as the news that Holbergskolen would hold a parent meeting on bullying on Thursday evening, where only women had access, the chairman of the Socialist People's Party, Villy S√∏vndal, immediately came to the scene with the sharpest condemnations. In Berlingske Tidende on Thursday, he was simply shocked that a school head could make such a decision, and he declared at the same time that we must not sacrifice equality and the fathers' right to participate in their children's school life for the sake of some twisted, religious views. And that's how it continued on both SF's website and Villy S√∏vndal's Facebook profile on Friday. But in the meantime unrest spread in the Socialist People's Party's hinterland, and a Gallup survey in Berlingske Tidende showed that 58 percent of the party's voters disagreed with calling the meeting totally unacceptable. Baglandet also doesn't like words like reactionary and medieval, because it obviously sounds too much like the Danish People's Party. Strange that the hinterland in the Socialist People's Party has become afraid to use these traditional socialist expressions about religion, but saying that Villy S√∏vndal had to turn the tide 180 degrees in a hurry. On Saturday, Ritzau could announce that Villy S√∏vndal is now a warm supporter of events that are about reaching out to the most isolated women. Full music retreat! A chairman who has become afraid of his own shadow! He clarified that his statements were only directed at the Muslim men who would not allow their wives to attend meetings with other men - as if that changes anything about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgender-segregated parenting meetings and as if it has anything to do with integration . Integration is probably Denmark's most misused term. The word has been used as a defense for everything from mother tongue education, to gender-segregated swimming lessons, headscarves, and halal meat in kindergartens to prayer rooms and special considerations for Muslim students during Ramadan ‚Äì yes, strangely enough, integration has become synonymous with a defense of parallel societies. As soon as the magic word integration is brought into play, even the grossest discrimination and oppression of women can be easily defended. After all, we only do it to integrate them, right? But integration is not about being tolerant of intolerance. Nor did the Social Democrats really know which legs the party should stand on, but their confusion was drowned out by the uproar in the Socialist People's Party. Helle Thorning-Schmidt chose to keep a very low profile, and integration rapporteur Henrik Dam suddenly thought on Saturday that the parents' meeting was a good idea - and used the same bland excuse as Villy S√∏vndal as a fig leaf. The social democratic child and youth mayor of Copenhagen Municipality, Anne Vang, took her party's integration rapporteur to task and was able to rejoice in Berlingske Tidende on Sunday that it now sounds as if we are in agreement. But isn't that a completely unimportant detail, whether Muslim men have actually prevented their wives from participating in joint parent meetings, or whether the initiative has come from the management of Holbergskolen based on a presumption that this might be the case? The discrimination is the same. No matter how you turn the case, it is about an unacceptable special treatment of Muslims and discrimination against men - based on the misunderstood position that gender-separated meetings promote integration.<U+0094>There are immigrant women if men do not believe that women must participate if there are other men present,<U+0094> said headmaster S√∏ren Elles√∏e to Berlingske Tidende on Thursday 4 February 2010. The case reveals deep and very serious cracks in the agreement on immigration and integration policy in both the Social Democracy and the Socialist People's Party. While both parties in Christiansborg are trying to reassure the population with messages that they will be tough on foreigners who do not want to integrate, the signals from parts of the hinterland are quite different. I remember how Villy S√∏vndal cleared the front pages of the newspapers with his statement that Hizb-ut-Tahrir could go to hell. Here was the new SF, which would be faithful to the left's original ideals of democracy and equality. A new SF, which boomed in the opinion polls for the same reason. What nobody really wrote about, however, was that Villy S√∏vndal would not lift a finger to get Hizb-ut-Tahrir banned. It was nothing more than bluster and lip service in honor of the media - invented by the army of spin doctors that the Socialist People's Party keeps busy. But not even the best spin doctor can cover up the lack of supply and uniformity on the shelves with the political goods. The voters quickly see that the signals are scattered in all corners of the world and that there is no coherence in the policy. The case of the Holberg School shows what we can expect if the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party together with the Radical Left capture government power. The former party will go to the polls with promises that the current immigration policy will be broadly maintained, but slowly the immigration policy will be dismantled piece by piece. I regret that the Liberals and Conservatives are not more firm in the flesh regarding integration policy, and I am upset that Integration Minister Birthe R√∏nn Hornbech and Education Minister Bertel Haarder refuse to map the extent of all the special considerations that characterize Danes' everyday life around schools and institutions . But the government at least respects the already concluded agreements on immigration policy. With Villy S√∏vndal and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, no one will know what the future may bring.

Strange that the hinterland in the Socialist People's Party has become afraid to use these traditional socialist expressions about religion, but saying that Villy S√∏vndal had to turn the tide 180 degrees in a hurry. On Saturday, Ritzau could announce that Villy S√∏vndal is now a warm supporter of events that are about reaching out to the most isolated women. Full music retreat! A chairman who has become afraid of his own shadow! He clarified that his statements were only directed at the Muslim men who would not allow their wives to attend meetings with other men - as if that changes anything about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgender-segregated parenting meetings and as if it has anything to do with integration . Integration is probably Denmark's most misused term. The word has been used as a defense for everything from mother tongue education, to gender-segregated swimming lessons, headscarves, and halal meat in kindergartens to prayer rooms and special considerations for Muslim students during Ramadan ‚Äì yes, strangely enough, integration has become synonymous with a defense of parallel societies. As soon as the magic word integration is brought into play, even the grossest discrimination and oppression of women can be easily defended. After all, we only do it to integrate them, right? But integration is not about being tolerant of intolerance. Nor did the Social Democrats really know which legs the party should stand on, but their confusion was drowned out by the uproar in the Socialist People's Party. Helle Thorning-Schmidt chose to keep a very low profile, and integration rapporteur Henrik Dam suddenly thought on Saturday that the parents' meeting was a good idea - and used the same bland excuse as Villy S√∏vndal as a fig leaf. The social democratic child and youth mayor of Copenhagen Municipality, Anne Vang, took her party's integration rapporteur to task and was able to rejoice in Berlingske Tidende on Sunday that it now sounds as if we are in agreement. But isn't that a completely unimportant detail, whether Muslim men have actually prevented their wives from participating in joint parent meetings, or whether the initiative has come from the management of Holbergskolen based on a presumption that this might be the case? The discrimination is the same. No matter how you turn the case, it is about an unacceptable special treatment of Muslims and discrimination against men - based on the misunderstood position that gender-separated meetings promote integration.<U+0094>There are immigrant women if men do not believe that women must participate if there are other men present,<U+0094> said headmaster S√∏ren Elles√∏e to Berlingske Tidende on Thursday 4 February 2010. The case reveals deep and very serious cracks in the agreement on immigration and integration policy in both the Social Democracy and the Socialist People's Party. While both parties in Christiansborg are trying to reassure the population with messages that they will be tough on foreigners who do not want to integrate, the signals from parts of the hinterland are quite different. I remember how Villy S√∏vndal cleared the front pages of the newspapers with his statement that Hizb-ut-Tahrir could go to hell. Here was the new SF, which would be faithful to the left's original ideals of democracy and equality. A new SF, which boomed in the opinion polls for the same reason. What nobody really wrote about, however, was that Villy S√∏vndal would not lift a finger to get Hizb-ut-Tahrir banned. It was nothing more than bluster and lip service in honor of the media - invented by the army of spin doctors that the Socialist People's Party keeps busy. But not even the best spin doctor can cover up the lack of supply and uniformity on the shelves with the political goods. The voters quickly see that the signals are scattered in all corners of the world and that there is no coherence in the policy. The case of the Holberg School shows what we can expect if the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party together with the Radical Left capture government power. The former party will go to the polls with promises that the current immigration policy will be broadly maintained, but slowly the immigration policy will be dismantled piece by piece. I regret that the Liberals and Conservatives are not more firm in the flesh regarding integration policy, and I am upset that Integration Minister Birthe R√∏nn Hornbech and Education Minister Bertel Haarder refuse to map the extent of all the special considerations that characterize Danes' everyday life around schools and institutions .

54378.0," The Danish People's Party is today launching a campaign for a Danish referendum on Danish participation in the European Pact. It will last four weeks, and the Danish People's Party's message <U+0094>ask the people<U+0094> will be visible everywhere in the street scene. The motif is the EU squeezing Denmark with its clammy, blue-yellow hand. The red government and the other EU-enthusiastic parties apparently believe that the last word in that matter IS said. Several times, with an echo from the EU, the government has repeated that Denmark is not going to give up sovereignty. But it seems strange, all the while the EU gets the right to turn its thumb up or down to the Danish Finance Act, which is otherwise exclusively a matter for elected Danish politicians. The red government and its EU friends know only too well that a large majority of Danes would vote no if the euro came to a vote in this country. Opinion polls have shown that more than two-thirds of Danes are opposed to the common currency. Maybe because they see how the euro these days is squeezing all the life out of Greece and the hard-pressed Greek population, who are either leaving the country or lining up in front of the soup kitchen. But the EU-enthusiastic Danish parties have, for a lifetime, chosen to turn a blind eye to the Danes' healthy EU skepticism. In the supporters' book, any opposition to the EU is directly dangerous and will inevitably conjure up the specter of nationalism. So when the red government wants the non-euro country Denmark to be made co-responsible for the future of the euro and subject us to a utopian budget discipline that only a small handful of EU countries can live up to, this is political bloodshed. The Danes are simply too stupid, people say. They neither want nor can grasp the importance of the EU. They have not understood that the EU in its current centralist version is our only salvation. This is how the red government and the EU-enthusiastic Left reason. The thought has never occurred to them that the Danes may have had the right gut feeling right from the start. Quite like the little boy in <U+0094>The Emperor's New Clothes<U+0094>. Now it is hard to accuse the Danes of being in possession of the roaring and aggressive form of nationalism that plunged Europe into two devastating world wars. Nevertheless, the scary image of nationalism is always brought out of the moth bag when EU skeptics or opponents allow themselves to cast doubt on the sustainability of the EU project or the democratic mindset of the non-elected commissioners in Brussels. As soon as the conversation turns to the EU, the Danish supporter parties simply pretend that the majority of Danes do not exist at all. They are swept under the carpet <U+0096> at best as foolish ignoramuses, at worst as ungrateful whiners. However, since 1972 we have had a tradition of following the constitution. Not even the most hardened EU fanatics could escape that. Therefore, in contrast to most Europeans, the Danish population has been asked every time Denmark joined a treaty which entailed surrendering sovereignty. However, supporters have rarely disputed the results of these polls. Not at all, when the Danes on 2 June 1992 said no to the Maastricht Treaty <U+0096>, nor when in 2000 they tried to get the Danes to change their minds about one of the four reservations that otherwise caused the union to < U+0094>slide down<U+0094> at the vote on the Edinburgh Treaty on 18 May 1993. The vote on the euro in September 2000 was a crippling blow to supporters. So paralyzing that they haven't really dared to let the Danes vote since. For a while it looked as if we were going to vote on the EU constitution in September 2005, but after the Dutch and French no a few months earlier, the vote was taken off the table. When the cosmetically moderated constitution saw the light of day in the form of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Danes were cleverly omitted to be asked. No, the supporters no longer dare to hear the voice of the people. In doing so, they also indirectly admit that the EU is a highly unpopular project that has nothing to do with the everyday lives of Europeans. But the Danish constitution cannot be manipulated by the supporters. And therefore we still lack an in-depth investigation of the extent of surrender of sovereignty in connection with a Danish accession to the European Charter. The government owes it not only to the Danes, but also to the constitution, which it has signed to comply with. It's no use making vague statements that Denmark <U+0094>enough<U+0094> will not be met with sanctions in case of poor budget discipline <U+0096> and that we will probably come to all the meetings. We demand clear answers. Can Denmark be fined, yes or no? After all, we are talking about fines of up to 0.1 percent of the gross domestic product. Is the government and a majority in the Danish Parliament prepared to take on this responsibility <U+0096> without having explained the consequences? In the Danish People's Party, we clearly say no. The Danes must be heard. This applies to our national self-determination. This applies to our future as an independent nation. I therefore hope that our campaign will give impetus to the debate that the government wants to avoid for all intents and purposes.

56318.0," In 100 days we will all go to the polls. On 26 May there are elections for the European Parliament. In the Social Democracy we are ready for battle. And there is enough to fight for. Around Europe, there are major problems with companies that deliberately circumvent the rules. Often you find employees who are employed in full-time jobs, but without normal employee rights. As a result, ordinary wage earners' pay and working conditions are pressured by unfair competition. It creates inequality and frustration. The problem is that the free movement of labour, services, capital and goods can trump the right to decent wages and working conditions. Here, EU cooperation has acquired a liberal side that damages the interests and conditions of wage earners. The Social Democrats want to do away with that. Meet us on the streets today Therefore, social democrats across the country are taking to the streets today with one common message that the Social Democrats will ensure that free movement also becomes fair movement. In the Social Democracy, we will not find ourselves in wage pressure and unfair working conditions. In Europe, employees must have the same pay for the same work in the same place.

56420.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter Monday 23 June 2014 Life must be made miserable for criminals! Some time ago, Denmark achieved a boring record in the EU. After Greece, Denmark is the most burglary-plagued country in the community. And this weekend it emerged that more than one in four burglaries are committed by visitors. In the first three months of the year, more than 2,000 citizens from 12 countries in Eastern Europe have been charged with violations of the law. This is shown by a report from the National Police. It also shows that the number of offenses committed by Eastern Europeans has grown sharply from 3730 in 2006 to 9632 in 2013. The government has done nothing significant to address this development. With the otherwise logical demand for control at the country's borders, the Danish People's Party has stood almost alone in the Folketing. And the problems do not only exist with car traffic at the border. Virtually no checks are carried out on passengers on international trains who cross the border <U+0096> and when checks are finally done on a random basis, there is often a gain. It does not look better at the country's airports, where the police are understaffed and cannot do much to prevent unwanted persons from entering the country. At the weekend, the Police Association sounded the alarm. The control at Copenhagen Airport does not even meet the requirements set by the Schengen Agreement for the control of persons traveling in and out of the Schengen area, and the police are not able to expand the control with the existing staffing. This means that the border is open to people who, for one reason or another, want to slip into Denmark unnoticed, even if they are unwanted in this country. Over the past 13 years, the number of police officers at the airport has been halved, which stands in stark contrast to the fact that in the same period there have been 30 percent more travelers passing through Copenhagen Airport. These are two different problems. The most urgent thing is the large stream of visiting criminals, who go on burglary tours unhindered and empty Danes' homes of valuables <U+0096> or give it away in the role of trick and pickpockets on the streets and alleys. Eastern Europeans have also proven to be particularly inventive when it comes to cheating with payment cards and manipulating ATMs. It is also easy for the criminals to smuggle large quantities of drugs across the border, and here studies have shown that in Sweden <U+0096> due to the frequent presence of customs officers at the border crossings <U+0096> they are able to confiscate far more drugs than we do in Denmark. The second problem is that the border is open to asylum seekers, who, among other things, can easily and conveniently get to Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia via the airport. And certainly not everyone who comes has the opportunity to get asylum. Many abuse the system to obtain residence in Denmark to commit various types of crime, and if they are finally exposed and go to prison, according to police officers, they often experience a stay that is a <U+0094>four-star hotel<U+0094 > worthy. Not terribly daunting! Border control has long been one of the Danish People's Party's clear demands. Opinion polls have shown that the Danes overwhelmingly support us in the demand, because many have gradually had problems in their lives when, for example, they have come home to a razed house, where all the drawers and cupboards have been turned upside down. Unfortunately, the demand has not had the great responsiveness of the majority in the Danish Parliament. They would much rather talk about all the things you can do in relation to police cooperation across borders. In the same breath, they mockingly claim that <U+0094>border barriers<U+0094> will have no effect. As if it's all a matter of a physical red-white border barrier. No, it's not about <U+0094>either-or<U+0094>. It's about <U+0094>both-and<U+0094>. Naturally, we must have cross-border police cooperation with our neighboring countries, etc., and the Danish People's Party supports the government's efforts to ensure that Denmark can achieve a parallel agreement on Danish participation in Europol cooperation.

56420.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter Monday 23 June 2014 Life must be made miserable for criminals! Some time ago, Denmark achieved a boring record in the EU. After Greece, Denmark is the most burglary-plagued country in the community. And this weekend it emerged that more than one in four burglaries are committed by visitors. In the first three months of the year, more than 2,000 citizens from 12 countries in Eastern Europe have been charged with violations of the law. This is shown by a report from the National Police. It also shows that the number of offenses committed by Eastern Europeans has grown sharply from 3730 in 2006 to 9632 in 2013. The government has done nothing significant to address this development. With the otherwise logical demand for control at the country's borders, the Danish People's Party has stood almost alone in the Folketing. And the problems do not only exist with car traffic at the border. Virtually no checks are carried out on passengers on international trains who cross the border <U+0096> and when checks are finally done on a random basis, there is often a gain. It does not look better at the country's airports, where the police are understaffed and cannot do much to prevent unwanted persons from entering the country. At the weekend, the Police Association sounded the alarm. The control at Copenhagen Airport does not even meet the requirements set by the Schengen Agreement for the control of persons traveling in and out of the Schengen area, and the police are not able to expand the control with the existing staffing. This means that the border is open to people who, for one reason or another, want to slip into Denmark unnoticed, even if they are unwanted in this country. Over the past 13 years, the number of police officers at the airport has been halved, which stands in stark contrast to the fact that in the same period there have been 30 percent more travelers passing through Copenhagen Airport. These are two different problems. The most urgent thing is the large stream of visiting criminals, who go on burglary tours unhindered and empty Danes' homes of valuables <U+0096> or give it away in the role of trick and pickpockets on the streets and alleys. Eastern Europeans have also proven to be particularly inventive when it comes to cheating with payment cards and manipulating ATMs. It is also easy for the criminals to smuggle large quantities of drugs across the border, and here studies have shown that in Sweden <U+0096> due to the frequent presence of customs officers at the border crossings <U+0096> they are able to confiscate far more drugs than we do in Denmark. The second problem is that the border is open to asylum seekers, who, among other things, can easily and conveniently get to Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia via the airport. And certainly not everyone who comes has the opportunity to get asylum. Many abuse the system to obtain residence in Denmark to commit various types of crime, and if they are finally exposed and go to prison, according to police officers, they often experience a stay that is a <U+0094>four-star hotel<U+0094 > worthy. Not terribly daunting! Border control has long been one of the Danish People's Party's clear demands. Opinion polls have shown that the Danes overwhelmingly support us in the demand, because many have gradually had problems in their lives when, for example, they have come home to a razed house, where all the drawers and cupboards have been turned upside down.

55954.0," There is a need more than ever for the Radical Left's voice in the debate. I therefore hope that you will actively contribute to spreading our position and proposals. Give Radikale Venstre a voice in the debate - so we ensure that Denmark's response to the refugee crisis comes from warm hearts and clear-thinking, solution-oriented heads. By Morten √òstergaard, political leader The refugee crisis in Europe simultaneously brings out the best and the worst in us. The Danes have in large numbers opened their homes and hearts to the refugees seeking shelter from the war with us. I am both proud of and happy about the responsibility and humanity that the Danes have shown. This is Denmark when we are at our best. The Danes' response to the refugee crisis is in stark contrast to that of the politicians - and the lack of leadership and realism that the political majority in Christiansborg has shown in recent days, weeks and months. Scary ads in Lebanese newspapers, marginalizing poverty benefits, government confiscation of jewelry, inhumanly harsh tightening of family reunification rules, living in tent camps in the winter cold and cutting foreign aid. These are just some of the initiatives that the government and associated majority have initiated. Not a single one of the measures will solve the challenges we face. But that is hardly the purpose either. The government's measures have not been taken with a view to stopping hostilities in the Middle East, rebuilding the surrounding areas or ensuring proper and dignified reception conditions at Europe's outer borders. They are not intended to ensure a solidary distribution of refugees in Europe or to create a sensible and effective integration at home. The proposals are cast in fear and delivered with a populist touch. It's about voters ‚Äì not people, one is tempted to say. At a time when it is difficult for so many others, it is more important than ever that the Radical Left combines decency and responsibility. As the responsible and humanist party that we are, we have persistently sought concrete, durable solutions in relation to the refugee crisis. Answers that will both make a positive difference for the people who come to us in need - and for Denmark and Europe. Our response to the refugee crisis is simple, humane and responsible. First, we want to stop the accident. It is simply no use for us to watch passively while the conditions in the war-torn countries and the surrounding areas get worse day by day. We will ‚Äì in contrast to the majority in Christiansborg ‚Äì significantly increase aid to the surrounding areas and drop the savings on development aid. In our draft finance law from the autumn, we have shown that such prioritization is possible. The government's savings are historically bad timing ‚Äì not just for the world's refugees, but also if we are to best serve Denmark's interests. We must have stopped the hostilities and rebuilt the surrounding areas in the Middle East. Only in this way will we stop the disaster. Secondly, we will join the fight for European solutions. We do not solve the problems by closing our borders and talking about a European solution for everyone but ourselves. This only makes the challenges greater and the crisis deeper. Instead, we must strengthen the EU's external borders with dignified and effective reception conditions. Here, efforts to distinguish between refugees and migrants must also be strengthened. Refugees must be helped. Migrants must be sent home. At the same time, we want ‚Äì together with an increasingly large proportion of Danes ‚Äì a permanent, common distribution of refugees in the EU, in which Denmark itself of course takes part. Strengthened external borders are an illusion without an internal distribution of solidarity. The solution exists. It has been prepared. And both countries and political leaders work to realize it across borders. Just not in Denmark. Thirdly, we must get the integration going at home. It will probably be many years before the people who have fled can return home. We decide for ourselves whether we meet those who come to Denmark with dignity and the desire that they become a resource rather than a burden. If you as the government impoverish, intern and passivate the refugees, you create fertile ground for a new disaster. We want a different path with integration from day 1. Refugees should not sit in an asylum center and look out the window or into the wall. They have to go to work. And in your own home. So that they can fend for themselves as soon as possible. To the benefit of themselves and for Denmark. There is more need than ever for the Radical Left's voice in the debate. I therefore hope that you will actively contribute to spreading our position and proposals. Give Radikale Venstre a voice in the debate - so we ensure that Denmark's response to the refugee crisis comes from warm hearts and clear-thinking, solution-oriented heads. Take responsibility.

56980.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter Monday 10 December 2012 An exciting Wednesday! The Prime Minister's Office has just <U+0096> as I write this <U+0096> issued a press release that Helle Thorning-Schmidt will give the country the honor of meeting ordinary Danish citizens tomorrow, Tuesday. The Prime Minister has set aside two hours to meet his subjects. Isn't that amazing? Shouldn't we be in deep admiration for this vernacular version of Thorning-Schmidt? And I wonder if the media will show up in large numbers <U+0096> so that the staged folkliness can be turned on its head? I wonder if the TV newspaper and the News on Tuesday evening will fully cover how the prime minister smilingly meets the citizens? Maybe there will also be Christmas lights, peppercorns and other Christmas crunches for those in attendance? Let's see if I'm wrong! But perhaps the media should reflect on the fact that, in addition to the two hours for the citizens, the rest of the week is devoted to running over the same citizens. When the EU shamelessly receives the Nobel Peace Prize later today, Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt will be in place in Oslo. According to a nationwide newspaper, it was a <U+0094>happy<U+0094> and <U+0094>proud<U+0094> prime minister who made the trip to Norway's capital on Sunday evening to participate in the award ceremony. It's hard to understand! It is completely surreal that the EU receives the award precisely at a time when crisis, insecurity and unrest characterize Europe, and where the EU does not seem to be able to solve the problems in any way. Over the years, the Nobel committee has had some incredible misfires, such as when President Obama in 2009 received the peace prize for expected actions, or when the terrorist Arafat received the peace prize in 1994 despite the bloody history of his organization PLO. This year's peace prize is yet another low point in the history of the peace prize, as they choose to give the prize to an EU that, despite its historical opportunities, has not at all managed to be what the citizens of the EU want. And many in southern Europe will look with deep wonder at what is happening in the high north today! The process surrounding the awarding of the award itself has developed into a tedious affair. Yesterday, the EU president paid tribute to the peace prize with his own haiku poem, and the presidents of the EU Commission and the EU Parliament respectively expressed their great enthusiasm. One can understand that somewhere, even if it is not pretty to see and listen to, since all three of them are, so to speak, <U+0094>the men of the system<U+0094>: It is expected of them that they support the EU, even if it looks very bad from the outside. It is not expected, at least not by the Danes, that the Prime Minister of Denmark does the same. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, is staying at home as he finds the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU for <U+0094>unfortunate<U+0094>. A Danish prime minister should also do that. If we had a prime minister who didn't just <U+0094>go along<U+0094>, but really dared to represent the Danes, we wouldn't be showing up in Norway today. Denmark must be a country where we think for ourselves. Where we dare to be critical and ask questions about the development. The British are now the critical <U+0096> ones who question the development. And as has been the case in Denmark in the past, Great Britain has a tradition of good and lively debate on political matters such as the relationship with the EU. We have had the same tradition in Denmark. But the current government is doing everything to avoid the debate on the EU. Until the Danes in September 2000 voted yes to the crown in the referendum, the majority in the Folketinget hoped that they could get the Danes on board with the idea that Denmark should be in the innermost core of EU countries. But the defeat was so severe that the strategy subsequently became to get Denmark involved as much as possible <U+0096> without having to ask the population. You could say that convincing the population was abandoned! This also meant that the debate about the EU and about how Denmark should participate in the EU has since been reduced to the lowest possible level. Now the only obstacle is ¬ß 20 <U+0096> of the Basic Law <U+0096> handing over sovereignty <U+0096> which requires either a 5/6 majority in the Folketing or a referendum. Now it is <U+0094>the sneaky policy<U+0094>, where Denmark must participate in as much of the EU as it possibly can without a referendum being absolutely necessary: ‚Äã‚ÄãBecause of the risk of the people rejecting surrendering sovereignty is simply too great. And one does not behave too well to go to the extreme limits of the law in order to avoid a referendum. We have seen this with the Treaty of Lisbon, where the question of relinquishing sovereignty or not (and thus referendum or not) has now reached the Supreme Court. One could appropriately ask the question whether it would not have been best that it had been the Danes from the start who decided Denmark's relationship with the Treaty of Lisbon? Currently, the government is in full swing negotiating how Denmark can be linked to the EU's future banking union. Such a connection will mean that the European Central Bank will have the opportunity to actually decide which Danish banks will in future be saved or which will have to turn the key. The majority in the Folketing is in favor of Danish accession to the banking union, but this naturally requires that this connection be screwed up in such a way that, in the legal sense, there is no question of a surrender of sovereignty. They'll figure that out. And if it is the same majority in Christiansborg, then the accession must take place with as little debate and publicity as possible. But it shouldn't be like that! If the prime minister seriously dares to meet the Danes <U+0096> and not just for two hours on a Tuesday afternoon <U+0096> she must contribute to a proper debate about what relationship Denmark should have with the EU. The elected representatives must conduct policy on the basis of a mandate from the people! The British Prime Minister David Cameron, the one who has been so sensible as to sign off on today's peace prize farce, will ensure the British a renewed debate on Britain's relationship with the EU. A necessary debate when the Euro countries want a more federalist development to save their currency. The fundamental debate about Denmark and the EU, which we so badly need, can help to ensure that it is the Danes, and not a group of Danish politicians without a popular mandate for their EU policy, who determine Denmark's relationship with the EU. On Wednesday 12 December, the Danish People's Party summoned Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to an urgent inquiry about developments in the EU. A debate that comes just before the EU summit on Thursday and Friday, when the banking union is on the agenda. After all, the Prime Minister has long since announced that she now accepts an EU at several speeds. But what does this mean in practice? What does this mean for Denmark's position? The Danish People's Party wants an open and fair debate about the EU's future <U+0096> and the population must be actively involved. We will try to convince the other parties in the Folketing of that on Wednesday. Citizens should not be eaten up by two hours on a Tuesday afternoon. It could be an exciting Wednesday!

54057.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech at the Danish People's Party's annual meeting 2018 - The spoken word applies - You still know what we stand for! We know what we stand for here in the Danish People's Party. We basically mean the same thing year after year. We have a clear red thread. You want to be able to wake up many Danes in the middle of the night and still get a clear answer to what it is that the Danish People's Party wants. I have occasionally appointed our party to be Denmark's most boring! Because we do not surprise. Because we keep the course. And once in a while I can understand that it can seem completely refreshing that there are other parties that jump and dance. That you have to follow closely - because you want to know what they are saying today? But then. Some sometimes it also happens that it gets so crazy - some would probably say crazy... - that you stop for a moment and think: What the hell is going on in Christiansborg? Like this summer, when all of a sudden everyone wanted to be Prime Minister - or as recently winter, when a party crawled around a tree and threatened not to vote for its own finance bill. When that happens, it always gives me reason to give it all a second thought; What on earth am I doing here? Why am I here? For whom? Is it any use? But I can already say that after a split second I always come to the conclusion that it makes SO much sense to be here! Here in the Danish People's Party .To work for our common cause! And I'm sure you feel the same way! Therefore: A big welcome here in Herning! It's almost the case that at this time of year, on this weekend, Herning Kongrescenter our second home. We feel both very welcome and very much at home here. No one needs to tell us; pretend you are at home. We already do that. Welcome guests, both from Denmark and from abroad. It is great that you are here. And, as always, also welcome to the press. There are many of you this year. It is We are happy with. Some people think that we politicians and you journalists live like cats and dogs, and that we are always at each other's throats. This is not the case. Not always, anyway. We are actually such warm supporters of a free, diverse press with many different approaches to news and events, that in addition to making a media settlement, where we hope to have strengthened the opportunities for many media, we have also decided to finance a new media ourselves. Namely ""ditoverblik.dk"", a online newspaper with a civic-national focus, which everyone can read and subscribe to for free. A good supplement to the daily news.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî An annual meeting like this here is, of course, first and foremost a celebration of the Danish People's Party. A celebration for our community - for that we want together and for what we have achieved. But it is also a celebration of Denmark. Because we are here precisely for this; Denmark and the Danes! You can put it this way that, fundamentally, Denmark is fantastic. And fundamentally, the Danish People's Party was created to keep Denmark fantastic! Our purpose is to ensure Denmark's freedom and independence and the happiness, rights and opportunities of the Danes in their own country. We do this with a sharp eye on our 1,000-year history, the Danish values, our common culture, language, faith and community. As we often remind each other: I have roots there - from there my world goes.* A word that often associated with being particularly Danish, is the word hygge. Hygge is a word that is difficult to translate into other languages. It is so difficult that when the Danish Institute for Happiness Research published an English-language book about Danish hygge a few years ago , the book was called ""The little book of Hygge"". Try to think about how often we use the word hygge... We sprinkle it around; ""it was nice to see you"", ""it's super nice here"", ""it was a nice evening"", ""we enjoyed the whole holiday"". Nice, nice, nice. Foreign countries are envious of our niceness. So what makes , that we have fun in Denmark? It's not just in the family that we do it. It's also when we meet other Danes on the road. When we see compatriots at the campsite in Southern Europe after many hours of driving down through Europe. Or when we get a four-night beer at the workplace. Isn't it because we feel safe? Isn't it because we feel we are with people who basically have the same values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms as ourselves? Do we in Denmark - maybe just because of our history and culture - brought us into a situation where the prerequisites for ""comfort"" are especially present? Is that why you can't just translate the word ""comfort"" into other languages? And if it is in this way, we actually have a special responsibility to ensure that future generations can also feel something particularly Danish about the concept of ""hygge"". Then there is something about cohesion, about national community, that we must hold on to. Perhaps that - without these words necessarily being used in that context - has something to do with us Danes trying to hold on to our national identity. That we are not so easily persuaded to let migrants from distant countries come here. That we are not so easily persuaded to let the EU rule even more over Denmark. Although the threats of what will happen if we are not right are often quite so violent. As with the vote on the Euro in the year 2000! If we did not vote yes, Denmark would not be able to cope economically. We would be left to fend for ourselves. But the Danes said no thanks, and Denmark is still here, stronger and still with our own currency ‚Äì the krone! Or like with the vote on the reservation of rights as recently as the 3 December 2015. Here was the threat that we could not cooperate at all with the other EU countries on cross-border crime if we did not do the right thing and remove the reservation of rights. We would be excluded from Europol cooperation. That threat was then supplemented with , that if you wanted to fight pedophilia, child abuse and drug rings, then you voted yes to the abolition of the legal relationship. If you had, as they said, ""another ambition"", you voted no. Ah yes - how low could you sink We recommended a no thank you, and the Danes said a resounding no thank you with over 53% of the votes. We still have ‚Äì and despite the threats ‚Äì excellent cooperation with the other countries. Also through Europol. We continue to cooperate to fight pedophilia and other deeply unappealing crime. And fortunately we still have our reservation of rights, where at the same time we maintain our sovereignty in relation to the asylum policy. The Denmark I would like to preserve is the Denmark where the Danes decide and where we enjoy ourselves, are safe, take those of us who cannot do it ourselves, take good care of our elderly so that they have a dignified old age and tirelessly ensure that Denmark is as balanced as possible. We do not succumb to the threats. We have heard them too often. And you must know that if the next time it is the defense reservation, which someone now wants to abolish - we are ready again. in advance. That the EU should not have more power over Denmark.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- There is a lot of discussion about what should happen after the next election. Whether it will come this autumn or first at the beginning of the new year. Will the blue bloc win? Will the red bloc win? And what about us in the Danish People's Party? Where do we place ourselves? We have made it very clear: We are going to the election on the assumption that if the four parties that currently have the majority regain the majority, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen can to continue as prime minister. But in any case it will be for a newly formed government. A government where we do not think that the Liberal Alliance should be able to set the course any longer. The last few years have shown us that it is not constructive to ensure a stable leadership of our country. I would like to emphasize that this is not about a party being excluded from influence. Because of course the Liberal Alliance must have an influence corresponding to their support from the Danes. They must be taken seriously and respected. But that must end with the LA being able to dictate what, for example, the Liberals must cooperate with us on. What compromises we must make - where, for example, we can also include the Social Democrats. That is why we must have a change of government after the next election! And I can also say to you : That if we get sufficient support from the Danes ‚Äì support from up to one in five Danes ‚Äì we will then in return be prepared to enter the government instead. I believe that the last few years have shown that it was right of us not to join the government at the time in the summer of 2015. It was ‚Äì and still is clear to me ‚Äì that the Liberals then wanted to go themselves. There were no real negotiations about a government basis where we could sufficiently get our policy .We could forget everything about border control. We could forget everything about borders for more EU. Questions could not be raised at conventions. And there must not be real growth in the public sector that could ensure the elderly, health, security. We reached therefore leading to the conclusion that we could get more through outside a government than inside. I have no doubt that was true. But the situation is changing. Today we have a collaboration with the Social Democrats, which was not at all on the drawing board in 2015. At the time, the Social Democrats had a chairman who swayed with Margrethe Vestager and who at no time involved us. Now Mette Frederiksen has clearly realized that the Social Democrats must take a different course in order not to end up as frayed as many of their sister parties around European countries .And the Liberals have now had a few years to hopefully realize that it probably gives a more stable government to think in our direction. The Liberals should be a few expensive experiences richer. About the EU, about migrants on our highways. About zero growth. About top tax. So that, after an election, we can have a real negotiation about a basis for government. In contrast to the situation after the election in 2015. So therefore: It will never be a goal in itself for us to get into government. But conversely, we must not be afraid of that, if it is through this that we can have the greatest political influence. And there are many indications that the circumstances may be such that after the upcoming election, the influence will be greatest if we show ourselves ready for government responsibility. And that is why I say: If the Danes give us sufficient support, we hereby declare ourselves ready to take responsibility - also as a government party.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì But what if the election turns out in such a way that the parties in the so-called red block have the majority? Skipper proposes himself to the Queen, who will probably end up working a little overtime... It can become quite dramatic and chaotic. , what then? And you know what? If it rings - we'll take it! What will come of it, of course, cannot be said. But I can promise one thing: And that is that the mandates in the Folketing, the Danes assign us, will never sit sullenly in a corner. They will never be used to simply express grievances. We will seek influence - so that the Danes who vote for the Danish People's Party know that they are getting maximum value for their vote. Our plan A ‚Äì our recommendation to the Danes ‚Äì is therefore that at the election we point to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen as continued prime minister, but for a newly formed government where we are also prepared to take on government responsibility ourselves. But if the Danes form the Folketing, then our plan A cannot be done, we will keep all cards open to ensure the greatest possible influence for the Danish People's Party. So if that situation arises, you ‚Äì Mette ‚Äì know my phone number!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì Because it is my opinion that the best and most viable policy will come out of a close collaboration between the Social Democrats, the Left and us. The Social Democrats have changed their immigration policy in the past few years. They now agree in many ways with our policy in the Danish People's Party. them at their word. Hold them firmly. And if they do, we will be the first to thank Mette Frederiksen. Historically, the Social Democrats have fought the Danish People's Party. But we must be prepared when opponents change and realize that we were right in our warnings about their previous policy. And together with our many years of experience in cooperation with the Liberals, I believe that in the future there should be fertile ground for a close and trusting cooperation between us three parties.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî But before general elections and possible government cooperation and everything else , which comes with it, don't we have a finance law that needs to be put in place? I am more hopeful this year than last year. This indicates that we can agree on a good finance law. Hopefully, without anyone, a trip to the treetops again! The government presented its plan for the finance act at the end of August. There are many good measures in the plan and it will also improve in line with all the election promises the government is busy with at the moment. Most recently in relation to the vocational schools that are in the finance act to having to save billions, but who now 14 days later have to get a similar bag of money back. That's how things can go fast sometimes.... But in a number of other areas the government now has to pull a little extra to get things done sensibly. For example when it comes to our pensioners. We have proposed that the ongoing erosion of the pension for both public and early pensioners be stopped. You may have heard about it. give a profit of DKK 43 per month - before tax! In any case, I have heard several people say that if it really is, then we must be able to come up with something better. But was the production right? Does the proposal mean just a gain of DKK 43 per month? Perhaps it gives a better impression of the content of the proposal if we look at how much a single public pensioner who receives full pension supplement and basic amount would have had extra this year if the pension had not been continuously eroded .The answer is DKK 8,000. That's a lot of money for people who already don't have that much. And with that knowledge, most people will certainly say that the proposal is really good. And if we don't do anything, the erosion will continue, and, according to the Elderly Case, mean that pensioners who only have public pension and old-age check to live on will have lost another DKK 6,400 in 10 years. So the proposal is about much more than DKK 43 a month. It is both about a lot of money - and it is about about decency. Because we believe that, as a minimum, pensioners should be regulated so that their pension follows the general wage trend. It's just common sense. And that's why we stick to our proposal!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî I talked before about getting the coffee sore throat. I got that the other day! I thought we had long since abandoned talking about the elderly as a burden. So I couldn't believe my ears when a prominent politician from another party referred to our elderly as - hold on - the burden of the elderly! Where did that come from? I thought I had heard it for the last time. But it must obviously be the term used in the corridors of Christiansborg. So I just have to state - then it is not the corridors of the Danish People's Party come to mind. Because I don't think there is anything more condescending than referring to the people who have toiled and dragged for Denmark for years as a burden! Our elderly deserve a proper old age - and this must apply all around! May we ask for a little respect for these fellow citizens - thank you! In these decades, we also get many older citizens, seniors - who have retired, but who still have a good health and who over the years have ensured that they have saved enough together to be able to have a financially better old age than could be expected in the past. It is really great that we also have this kind of elderly people here in Denmark. The Danish People's Party's elderly policy has after all, it was always first and foremost about ensuring that the pensioners who do not have the largest private pensions - who cannot afford to go on holiday abroad, are protected. Pensioners who often have to turn over every penny to get the finances to hang together. We must pay special attention to them! This was also why we introduced the elderly check in due time. We also have a special responsibility for those who sit in our care homes and who are deeply dependent on proper and dignified care .Those who don't necessarily shout the loudest - but those who need help the most. We must be there for them - we must pay particular attention to them! But we also have the basic position that when things are going well in Denmark, should all Danes want to feel the progress. And that also applies to our pensioners. That is why we want to relax set-off rules, so that the pensioners can also feel the better times.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî In addition to having room for maneuver to use for better welfare, there is certainly also places where we can find money. If I mention the figure 36 billion kroner, you know what I'm thinking of.... The Ministry of Finance has calculated that the public coffers are burdened with between 30 and 40 billion kroner each year for non- Western immigrants in Denmark. And yes. Non-Western immigrants is a broad term. I wonder if it is more of an economic burden because of people from the Middle East and North Africa than because of people from Asia. We know that! And as if that were not enough. Then the policy of Enhedslisten, the Radicals and the Alternatives will lead to even greater immigration from the Middle East and North Africa and even greater expenses in the future. To irreparable damage to our national community and cohesion. Now the radicals are holding a national meeting in Nyborg, while we hold our annual meeting here in Herning. And therefore it is also appropriate to send a greeting. Actually, I do it with a small memory of an episode in Odense last Saturday. Here I was standing at our stand at the Funen people's meeting at side of the Radicals' stand. And Morten √òstergaard and I were then teasing each other when a woman came up to us. She was visibly surprised to see us in a festive and pleasant banter. How on earth could such two fighting cocks be standing next to each other of each other - almost without getting into a fight. And she asked sweetly if she could take a picture of this historic situation. Which she of course agreed to. For Morten √òstergaard! It's not you we're against. It is your policy! It is your policy, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration, that will be deeply harmful to our country. And precisely in this area, we cannot even find faith in the future in blessed Svend Auken's quote about radical politics: ""That it is as hard to get wise about radical politics as nailing pudding to a wall.‚Äù Because in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration, we know exactly what you want. And you knew - even when you were in government last time - what you wanted and got it through. So to you in Nyborg: Have a really good national meeting. We really hope that for you .But we hope at the same time - that the Danes will ensure that you - gathered in Nyborg - will never again have an influence on immigration policy.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- There are so many things we would like to ensure in our Denmark. Fortunately, there is broad agreement on , that our healthcare system must be world class. It MUST work. It MUST be there for us when we need it. We MUST prioritize that. When there are so many people who pay their taxes without much fuss, it hangs among other, together with the fact that we know that we and those we care about can get help and care, care and treatment when we need it, regardless of the size of our wallet. THAT is welfare in our society. We must protect that .And that is what we are doing in the Danish People's Party. Many things are happening in the field of health these years. Big projects - with big ambitions. That is good. But it also challenges our talented staff in our hospitals. They are running really fast. in between. That is why it was also really good that last year we got the annual two-percent saving requirement removed, which hospitals had been subject to for many years. It was something that the Danish People's Party had fought for for years. And in the end it succeeded. But there are more challenges. Things that we simply have to do better. There are maternity wards where staff are under so much pressure that they do not feel they can deliver the care and treatment they would like. Medical wards where overcrowding is still a problem. Where patients too often have to lie in the corridors. It is and there is psychiatry, which lacks resources. Where far too many patients are re-hospitalised and re-hospitalised, and where it too often happens that suddenly it is the police who are left with the task of handling mentally ill. This is not how it should be. In the future, you will spend less time in a hospital bed when you are admitted. And it may be a long way from the hospital where you can get the best treatment .Therefore, we will have to have a greater focus on what happens before you get to the hospital and on the treatment you have to have when you get home again. the municipalities must deliver in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhealth. And therefore, in the coming years, it will be about there being a proper connection between the hospital, the municipality and the general practitioner. That there is control, that the right ones are ready to receive someone who patient when you are discharged from hospital. That you get the right help. On time. That we ensure more closeness in our healthcare system. And when the municipalities take up more space, the regions automatically take up less space. I therefore think also that the time has come to have a serious discussion about whether we even need the regions anymore. Do we really need three administrative layers and three teams of elected politicians to handle the health sector? In a country with the same population like Hamburg with its catchment area? No. I don't mean that. And here I am of course not thinking about all the skilled and dedicated people who work in our hospitals. Of course they will also do that in the future. We need them to that extent .But we don't need regional councils with politicians and civil servants. The state and the municipalities can easily take on the task. And the money we save by abolishing the regional councils, we can invest in an even better healthcare system. Better quality. More time. More proximity. And when we now talk about closeness, I want to return to the closeness we must ensure in Denmark. How we tie Denmark together so that we get a country in balance. Many may remember that we have had the discussion before. In the 1980s , where Copenhagen needed a helping hand from the rest of the country. Buildings in our capital were in disrepair. Houses that had perhaps been emptied by the municipality because the houses were considered uninhabitable. Pests and wild cats had taken over several residential areas. In 80 The population rattled down in the '90s - the economy in Copenhagen suffered and the municipality could not pay its bills. It was not long ago - but then Denmark stood together to get Copenhagen back on the right track. Copenhagen has come to that extent. That is why it has after all, it's also good to see when you drive into Copenhagen how people build and build. New homes for the many, many people who want to live in our capital. Buildings that once stood in disrepair have either been renovated, demolished down or rebuilt. But in a time when the capital is now booming outwards - where the economy is growing strongly, it is also important that we keep an eye on the rest of Denmark. The government made a sensible move after the 2015 election, when the ambitions were high in order to create a balanced Denmark. State workplaces were moved into the country and some education places were moved outside the four largest cities. In addition, together with the government, we presented a good and strong media settlement in the early summer, where thorough DF imprints were put in relation to strengthening the regional media. The media agreement was the latest in a series of initiatives to create a better balance in Denmark. But now it is as if the government is playing on two horses, and doubts are being created about the government's policy. That, I think, is a shame! Because when, according to figures from the organization Denmark on the verge, we can see that some municipalities can have a low tax rate and high welfare, and other municipalities have to fight a battle to ensure welfare for their citizens, at the same time , that they have Denmark's record in municipal taxes, then we have a challenge with our balance sheet. It does no good, after all, that as an elderly person you have to consider moving municipality, simply because the municipality you live in cannot afford decent care for the elderly. So it is better that we ensure that all municipalities have a sensible economy. We don't want more areas of our country to wither away - because we didn't think about it in time. Where you can't mortgage, you can't send your children to school, where shopping opportunities are a city in Russia. We want a Denmark that hangs together. Where it is possible to live your life in a sensible way everywhere on the small piece of land that Denmark is in the world. First time in 100 years we have heard of net migration to our islands. It has not come about by itself! It has come about because of political decisions that we in our party have been at the head of. And we should be proud of, that we fight for a Denmark where it is also possible to live on one of our many islands or in our rural districts. It is actually not in the interests of the big cities that we all move to the big city. This will present even greater challenges than those already fighting there today. So yes - although it can sometimes be difficult to see the course of other parties, you can also count on us in the Danish People's Party here: We stick to the vision of a balanced Denmark!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Since the election in 2015 - and since the refugee and migrant crisis was at its peak, and the migrants poured across the border unhindered and waded up the Danish motorways - we have spent a great deal of effort to slow down the influx of asylum seekers. We have implemented well over 100 austerities. And we have worked! There are far fewer asylum seekers coming here. In 2015, 10,849 asylum seekers received residence permits in this country. A huge number. Way too big. In the first five months of 2018, the number was 581. Still too many. But a rather significant decrease. It's a huge difference. Our policy works! Imagine if it had been Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Morten √òstergaard who had still been in power. A scary thought. I can't bear to think about it at all. Now is the time to to take the next step. And that is to ensure that many of the people who have received asylum and help in Denmark on a temporary basis return home and help rebuild their country. Their future does not lie in Denmark. We has ensured that fewer people come in ‚Äì and of course we must continue to do so. Now we must also ensure that far more people come out. Fewer people in, more people out. That's how it has to be. called a paradigm shift. Not the most appropriate word, I admit. Perhaps it was better to just call it a repatriation policy? At least it is understandable. There is not much to be wrong about. Because repatriations are is needed if we are to stop the trend towards Denmark becoming more and more characterized by Islam. Because that is actually what has happened for many years. A larger and larger part of Denmark's population consists of people with origins in Muslim countries .It's bad. And if the unfortunate thing should happen, that the chaos pilot Uffe Elb√¶k and Morten √òstergaard seriously influence Danish politics again, the influx will increase again. It will be catastrophic. And if you don't think that it will have a big meaning, you can just glance over the √òresund and look at the tragic conditions in Sweden, where gang rapes, gang wars, car burnings, Sharia courts and insecurity are today's disorder. These are the consequences of many years of deeply irresponsible immigration policy. Dear friends, that's it , that is at stake! Elb√¶k, √òstergaard and Skipper and whatever else they are called must not for all intents and purposes be allowed to set the course for Denmark and open the borders wide open again. That must not happen. We must do everything , what we can to prevent. And we WILL do everything we can to prevent that!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- This is also what Jimmie √Ökesson and the Sweden Democrats are doing everything they can to prevent in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats fights for the Swedes' cause. And it resonates. Many Swedes have had enough. The party got a great election last Sunday. 17.6 percent of the votes. A significant improvement from the last election's 12.9 percent. They can be happy and proud of that .And especially in a situation where all the other parties have ganged up against the Sweden Democrats and where the media have also done what they could to make life difficult for the party.We are, on the other hand, happy that Jimmie √Ökesson has chosen to take the time to come here to Herning and deliver a greeting to us later today. We are looking forward to hearing that.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- I am also happy that the government has now finally found out that will do something about the fact that stateless persons have been able to obtain citizenship in this country, EVEN THOUGH PET says that they are a danger to the security of the kingdom. citizenship. It is COMPLETELY absurd. The government thinks so now that they may have found a solution. And that is fine. Better late than never. Basically, I do not understand at all that it has to be so complicated. Because the Constitution says It is clear that the right to citizenship is granted by law. It is the Folketing that decides. And only the Folketing. That is how it should be anyway. And that is how we in the Danish People's Party think it should be. And then we can sort of not care if there are any conventions that might say otherwise. But strangely enough, it is a point of view that we are quite alone with... In general, the whole discussion about citizenship has potential terrorists has been grotesque. It was precisely because, in an advertisement, we alerted the Danish population to the completely insane situation in the Folketing, where a large majority was in the process of granting citizenship to a person who PET had warned could be a danger for the security of the kingdom, that the debate started. It was the advertisement that caused a case to be brought against us. Because we had reproduced quotes from the debate in the parliament hall and had used a picture of a bill. There was someone, who felt violently offended. And lawyers were ready to prosecute the case against us. Of course, with a free process....and costs to the state treasury as a result. It was a worse circus. .Far out. Then it is good that we have a Supreme Court that can cut through. Because we were completely acquitted in the Supreme Court in March this year. 7 unanimous Supreme Court judges put things in place. It was a great victory - not just for us. But also for freedom of speech. And for democracy. Many thanks to the Supreme Court for sweeping both the district court and the district court out of the way and securing freedom of speech in our country!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Well, back to the future. When we have an effective repatriation policy, then will it also mean that in the future we will not have to spend large resources on integrating asylum seekers into Danish society. Their future is in their home country. In the future, it should also be the end of being able to apply for asylum in Denmark, if only you can afford to pay a people smuggler to transport one up here. Simply an asylum stop. And instead of spending 30-40 billion kroner every year to pay for non-western immigrants here in Denmark, we would much rather spend money on helping refugees in their immediate area. Where we can help many more people for the money and where at the same time we free up a lot of money to develop our own welfare society. And quite frankly, dear friends.

56226.0," It is hardly too much to say that the election result sent shock waves through the EU system. The chairman of the EU Commission, Jos&eacute Manuel Barroso, has long scolded the Swiss desire to secure the country's own inhabitants. From the EU's side, this will mean a reconsideration of trade agreements with the EU, says the threat. Now Switzerland is not a member of the EU, but we see here another clear example of the EU system's always strong reactions to national wishes to limit the harmful effects of the free movement of labor, open borders, etc. Seen from there, it is always the EU system that knows best. Not the nation-states and their populations. Switzerland has a good tradition of referenda. They are an ingrained element of Swiss democracy. If 100,000 signatures are collected for a referendum on a particular issue, yes, the Swiss will go to the polls. In recent times, there have therefore been votes in the country on minarets, citizens' wages, executive salaries and now immigration from other EU countries. These are complicated issues, but in the Alpine region it is the inhabitants who decide. Referendums are not seen here as a problem that should preferably be avoided, as there is a risk of citizens voting <U+0094>incorrectly<U+0094>. Here it is quite natural that the people vote and decide. Here, it is hardly heard in the debate that topics such as joining the EU's patent court and thus ceding Danish sovereignty to the EU are a complicated, detailed issue that is not suitable for a referendum. All in all, the EU system and a number of Danish politicians could very well be inspired by the Swiss model. Because if the populations of the EU countries had been listened to and consulted to a greater extent via, for example, referendums, we would hardly be in the situation we are in now. A situation where there is huge skepticism towards the EU among the Germans, French, English, Danes and many other people in the EU countries. Yes, a poll less than six months ago showed, for example, that half of Germans want the next German chancellor to try to decentralize power back to the national, regional and local level. Only a quarter of Germans thought that the EU's current power is ok. The population no longer wants the EU. But the EU system reacts unwisely by implacably attacking any attempt to roll back the power that the EU has gradually taken. Any questions raised about, for example, open borders and the free movement of labor are also frowned upon, even though in practice it has been shown that precisely these cause great anguish for many EU countries. The EU system should know that the EU exists on the background and because of the citizens of the nation states and not the other way around. And therefore the EU summit should be part of a real and broad dialogue about the EU's future. Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the rest of the government should do the same. But any approach to a debate about, for example, a more flexible EU, which British Prime Minister David Cameron has called for, is met with exactly the same tones from Helle Thorning-Schmidt as we hear from the EU system: The EU is not some take-your-own table, it says. The British and Denmark have chosen different tracks, it says. No dialogue, no debate. It can be hoped that May's EU referendums will fuel this necessary debate. But the reluctance to deal with a more flexible Europe has already shown itself to be great. Wonder why? It may be that Thorning and the government fear that a discussion about the British model will show that the Danes want the flexible EU. I think the Danes do! But it could also be that Helle Thorning-Schmidt is keeping the door open to apply for a top post within her beloved EU system this summer. In that case, it is difficult to look towards Switzerland and Great Britain, even if you should.

53677.0," Refugees must only have help and protection in Denmark temporarily. They must return home and help rebuild their homelands as soon as possible. This is the core of the repatriation policy that the Danish People's Party fought through and adopted with the Finance Act for 2019 with votes from both the parties in the then VLAK government AND the Social Democrats. There are numerous examples of leading social democrats ‚Äì including Mette Frederiksen herself ‚Äì loudly and solemnly promising that they are completely behind this policy. Before the election, there was no limit to how certain it would be that they would maintain our immigration policy if they gained power. But now they are running from another crucial point in immigration policy. And again, it is about the fact that as a refugee you should not travel home anyway, even if the conditions in the home country are suitable. The last time was with the Finance Act in the autumn, when De Radikale got through that 2 years of work means that refugees can stay - even if according to our rules they have to go home. This time it is about the fact that the independent Refugee Board has determined that the conditions in Damascus province in Syria are now so safe that rejected asylum seekers can be sent back there. This is of course good news. But even if they said the opposite before the election, the S government will now not send the Syrians home! The reason is that the government will not cooperate with the Assad regime in forcibly repatriating rejected asylum seekers. But Syria has the government they have. We cannot change that here in Denmark. And it wasn't a reservation either, the S people spent time telling the Danes about before the election... In concrete terms, this means that three Syrians, who have had their asylum applications processed according to all the rules of the art and have been refused residence in Denmark, must now stay at an exit center in this country instead of returning home to Syria, where they belong to. And of course it sends a clear signal to all other Syrians who are faced with having to go home, that if they refuse to go voluntarily, the government will allow them to stay here. In 2018, Mattias Tesfaye (S), who has since become Minister of Immigration and Integration, said otherwise: ""We are at the heart of the refugee problem here. If it is not possible to send the Syrians home while they are here on a temporary protection scheme, refugees have effectively become immigrants.‚Äù Totally agree, Mattias Tesfaye! But why have you changed the policy now? Why have you forgotten the promises from before the election? Why not repatriate Syrians to safe areas in their homeland when possible? It may well be that the Social Democrats are trying to avoid discussions about their immigration policy. Too many Danes will be disappointed as they discover what the government is up to. But the rest of us must then take on the task of informing the Danes. Because only pressure from the population can ensure an immigration policy that really suits Denmark!

54107.0," And it's good that the election is coming. We need to vent. Far too many resources are being wasted on election campaigns at a time when, more than ever, there is a need for concrete political solutions for the benefit of the Danes. But that doesn't mean that things haven't been accomplished in 2010. Looking back on the year that has just passed, I'm quite satisfied. Also in 2010, the Danish People's Party has shown that we have the will and the courage to take responsibility, while the left is freewheeling with political announcements in all corners of the world. I remember from my two duel meetings with the Social Democratic Party's chairman Helle Thorning-Schmidt recently, that I was constantly met with the claim that the Danish People's Party should not have <U+0094>taken responsibility<U+0094>. The claim was repeated like a mantra ad infinitum. But that didn't make it any more true. On the contrary. If there is anything the Danish People's Party has done, it is to take responsibility. Even if it hurt, and even if we obviously had to prioritize. I am thinking here particularly of the economic recovery package that the Danish People's Party voted for in May, while the Social Democrats and SF shortly afterwards launched a <U+0094>fair solution<U+0094> which tried to deceive the voters that all our problems can be solved by working one more hour per week. Added to this are announced tax increases of DKK 33 billion in 2011-2013. You can't exactly call it a <U+0094>fair<U+0094> solution. The recovery package, on the other hand, was both a fair and necessary response to the major challenges we were faced with in the wake of the serious global financial crisis, which we are still in. The Danish People's Party refused to follow the government's proposal to expose the municipalities to savings of four billion kroner , just as we rejected a freeze on public pension, early retirement pension, cash assistance, SU and unemployment benefits. In return, we had to cut the unemployment benefit period and put a ceiling on the child family allowance and deductions for professional dues. It was a real <U+0094>fair solution<U+0094>. The weakest groups in society were largely exempt from savings. The recovery package was not a <U+0094>massacre<U+0094> of the welfare society, but rather a necessary safeguard against otherwise inevitable deteriorations in welfare. The Finance Act Agreement for 2011 followed the same track. The government and the Danish People's Party adopted initiatives that ensure growth. We agreed on a de-bureaucratisation of the public sector <U+0096> and most importantly: More money for the health sector in, for example, rehabilitation and rehabilitation. At the same time, we adopted the introduction of a point system for family reunification, because of course we have to make demands on the people who choose to take up residence in Denmark. There is not the shadow of <U+0094>snobbery<U+0094> in this system, as the left has claimed, but rather a range of ways to qualify for residence in Denmark. The point system was necessary. Immigration from non-Western countries has forced the Danish welfare system to its knees in several areas. Action was needed. Welfare and immigration are linked. Qualified immigration is beneficial to Danish society and must <U+0096> quite properly <U+0096> ensure our welfare. But immigration of uneducated and undemocratic people drags us all down. It is thus very significant that most immigrants from Western countries are on average less criminal than the Danes, while immigrants from the Middle East are strongly overrepresented in the statistics. But the New Year is not all about looking back. New Year also gives occasion to look into the crystal ball and try to predict events in the coming year. But when I look at the big crystal ball, unfortunately a very foggy and unclear picture emerges. It flickers and flashes in all sorts of colors <U+0096> also very dark and grey. The coming year will show how the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party will tackle the challenges in the economic field. Very surprisingly, Ole Sohn recently stated that the public sector has become too large. I am curious whether this realization will shape the Socialist People's Party's economic policy, or whether it is just another strategic announcement. I am worried about how the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party will handle immigration policy. Helle Thorning-Schmidt stated in November that now it was <U+0094>enough<U+0094>. Now the immigration policy was never to change again. Oh yes, it would be nice if you could lock everything down like that for time and eternity. No responsible politician can say that <U+0094>now is enough<U+0094>. It is the task of the responsible politician to act when the situation calls for it. Finally, I am very much looking forward to seeing how a possible S-SF government will manage without the Danish People's Party in the field of immigration. Det Radikale Venstre and Enhedslisten will not only reject any point system <U+0096> they will simply roll back the entire immigration policy. It will mean goodbye to all austerity since 2001. Setting aside the flicker in the crystal ball, the 2011 election is really very simple. It is a choice between a responsible policy with coherence and a political lucky bag full of studs. Considering the current crisis, I hope that the Danes will choose what is perhaps a little predictable, but on the other hand familiar and safe.

56371.0,"When you come to Denmark, you get the right to freedom. In return, there is a responsibility to preserve the society that we have built up over generations. When you come to Denmark, you get the right to freedom and the freedoms that come with it. In return, there is a responsibility to preserve the free and open society that we have built up over generations. In the Social Democracy and SF, we will always fight for Denmark to be characterized by a free and open society. That is why we are putting forward 8 concrete measures to put an end to parallel societies and ghetto formations. As a society, we have long believed that integration was about those who came here having a job and learning the Danish language. Then the integration should probably succeed, and they would share our values. And fortunately, there are quite a few who do. But we must also realize that there is a hard core who are ideologically and politically opposed to our democracy, values ‚Äã‚Äãand freedoms, and who oppose it at every opportunity. This means that today we are faced with parallel societies in several places in Denmark, where there is a lack of equality between the sexes, a fatal and flawed view of child-rearing and a deeper distancing from the whole of Danish society and our community of values, because there are deep, anti-democratic strength. We cannot and will not accept parallel societies and ghetto formations where democratic values ‚Äã‚Äãand Danish culture are not dominant. The Social Democrats and SF are ready to do battle with social control and oppression. And we are determined to break the historical development in the composition of residents, which has led to non-Western immigrants forming the majority in more and more residential areas, schools and educational institutions.

53846.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter - Monday 27 May 2013 The government must be confronted with its harmful policy On Wednesday 29 May, the Folketing will hold its annual closing debate. Admittedly, the Norwegian Parliament continues its work after this date, but it is on Wednesday that the traditional marathon debate takes place. It simply happens by the political rapporteurs asking the question: <U+0094>What can the Prime Minister provide about the domestic and foreign policy situation?<U+0094>, and then the debate goes on. There is undeniably enough to deal with. Because right now we have a government that is simply sailing around as if there was no rudder or steering wheel, just as the captain seems to be everywhere but on the bridge. The government has fumbled and zigzagged around the unemployment benefit area, the kickstart and growth issue, about tax breaks for business, on legal policy and so on and so forth. Especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration, the government is in full swing of destroying everything that the previous government, under the strong influence of the Danish People's Party, had built up. Immigration policy is simply running amok. Thorning, Vestager and Vilhelmsen have eased the immigration policy step by step, and it has actually gone stronger than people had thought before the election. After all, Helle Thorning-Schmidt proclaimed in 2010 that she <U+0094>could not dream of moving towards a more relaxed immigration policy<U+0094>, but since she became Prime Minister, we have seen a long series of relaxations that will cost the Danes dearly. The examples of this simply line up. The start-up aid, the cash aid ceiling and the points system have been abolished. The rules for family reunification have been relaxed, asylum seekers have been allowed to live and work outside the asylum centers and last week the government together with Enhedslisten relaxed the requirements for Danish citizenship. Now it is suddenly less important to be able to communicate in Danish, and the requirements for self-support have been relaxed from employment for 4.5 years out of the last five years to 2.5 years out of the last five. It is obvious that if our welfare society is to last, we must and must ensure that the foreigners who come to stay can and will support themselves. The relaxation of the requirements for self-sufficiency is an obvious step backwards in relation to this and in relation to integration as a whole. Unfortunately, the government's series of relaxations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãforeigners have long since been successful in relation to the number of asylum seekers. Thus, it appears that in 2013 Denmark will receive the highest number of asylum seekers since 2001, i.e. the year in which the Danish People's Party gained decisive influence and used it to secure a more reasonable immigration policy. The annual expenses for this area have also long since reached the billion mark, and the expenses naturally increase as the number of asylum seekers grows. There is no doubt that the increased flow of asylum seekers is due to the government's policy. The foreigners who travel thousands of kilometers and through many countries to seek asylum are, to a large extent, quite well aware of which country it is best to seek asylum in. Now Denmark has come up with this negative <U+0094 >positive-list<U+0094>, and we experience the consequences of that. The government denies that this is the case, which in my book is roughly tantamount to denying the existence of gravity. As the former head of research at the Social Research Institute and the Rockwool Foundation, Gunnar Viby Mortensen, has stated: <U+0094>If a country relaxes the asylum conditions, the flows go there<U+0094>, and he adds: <U+0094>It is problematic when we currently have an extensive problem with the employment of non-western immigrants. Half of the men are without a job, and for the women it is more than half<U+0094>. But one thing is the economic aspect, something else is the massive problems that a large group of hard-to-integrate non-Western immigrants bring with them. The many nights of violent trouble, arson and stone-throwing committed by young immigrants and their descendants in Sweden are a clear example of the challenges that a massive immigration of non-Western immigrants brings with it. We have also seen similar riots in Paris and to a lesser extent in Denmark. Is this the kind we will see more of if we don't take immigration and integration very seriously? I am genuinely concerned about it. But why is the government doing the exact opposite of what is sensible? Helle Thorning-Schmidt relaxes, despite the promises made before the election in September 2011, when she should at least keep the rules that she took over from the previous government and the Danish People's Party. Someone could perhaps object that the government, in the form of Minister of Social Affairs Karen H√¶kkerup (S), has just today put on the iron gloves in the form of the announced parental levies, where burdened parents are hit on the wallet. To that, I would first like to say that this is yet another U-turn on the part of the government, because then Social Affairs Minister and current Employment Minister Mette Frederiksen thundered against parental orders when the Danish People's Party demanded increased use of this sanction. Next, I would like to say that everything indicates that the report is a mere parade report on the part of the government. The parental order is used extremely rarely. It was actually for this reason that the Danish People's Party wanted to significantly increase the use of this topping. Karen H√¶kkerup announces that she will set up a Task Force (as a special group must obviously be called in today's Denmark) that will get more municipalities to use parental orders. Now let's see if that actually happens. I doubt it, but I guarantee that the Danish People's Party will follow developments closely. But right now and here it applies to the closing debate on Wednesday, where we in the Danish People's Party are completely and utterly ready to have a fundamental debate with the government. We have many questions about immigration, integration and the government's easing of immigration policy, which we look forward to discussing with the government's ministers! And although the government has not been particularly keen on debate during the parliamentary year <U+0096> I think of the teachers' conflict, the doctors' conflict, the publicity act as examples, I hope that the government, in relation to its more relaxed immigration policy and its consequences, will answer our questions on Wednesday!

55369.0," I think the elderly are being de-prioritized here during the corona crisis. For example, it took a very long time for the social democratic government to realize that resources had to be set aside for the elderly in care homes to be visited. Now, many places are struggling to make the conditions work in practice. Many elderly people are lonely - and if you have dementia, it can even be with the fear that you have been let down by your relatives. Inhuman! But also in relation to the aid packages, it is as if the elderly play no role. A great many seniors are still in work. They have done exactly what society has asked of them: Namely continue even though they have reached retirement age. Many of these elderly people have ‚Äì like many others ‚Äì been fired, but contrary to the rules for unemployment benefits, no help has come to the elderly who are fired. They have been told that they can go on public pension and many have therefore had a large drop in income. Unreasonable! The elderly should be helped just like others who have been affected. Now the debate has started on how the economy can be pushed back into motion after the crisis. There are many suggestions. But don't let the elderly be forgotten again. How about an extra elderly check? And maybe tax free? Or make the public pension tax-free for a number of months? I am sure that if the elderly, who have the least in everyday life, get some extra money, they will go to some much needed purchases. Immigration policy is also progressing during this time. On Friday it went wrong again. The social democratic government with its majority got 1st consideration of the proposal that foreigners who have had asylum and according to our repatriation policy (the paradigm shift) must return to their home country, can still stay in Denmark. And from July 1, the government opens up more immigration of skilled labor from third world countries. Even now - with the corona crisis - at a time when we otherwise have increasing unemployment. Otherwise, we need to stick to the immigration policy instead. We have enough problems with immigrants. On 30 April, PET and the Copenhagen Police carried out a coordinated action, in which a man was arrested. He is now charged under the terrorist section for preparation of terrorist attacks with a militant Islamist motive. The scourge of Corona has not washed away the Islamists' hatred of us. The terrorist threat is still there. Also in Gellerup near Aarhus, we have seen how certain groups during the corona crisis have continued their fight to expand the role of Islam in the public space with Muslim prayer calls from public address systems. It does not belong in Denmark. It must be stopped! Even the development in the spread of infection shows how immigrant environments stand out negatively from the rest of Denmark. Immigrant-dense municipalities on Copenhagen's Vestegn are the hardest hit in the country. The situation is quite bad among younger non-Western immigrants and descendants, where the infection is three times as widespread as among Danes in the same age group. Can a lack of community spirit and irresponsible behavior in certain immigrant environments play a role in this context? We have seen prayer meetings and funerals where groups of Muslims openly flout the authorities' recommendations to keep their distance. A professor and senior physician at the Department of Infection Medicine at Hvidovre Hospital has commented on the infection figures among younger non-Western immigrants and descendants as follows: ""They show that there is a larger proportion of this group who have not taken the instructions seriously"". I see it as yet another example that here is a group of people who do not see themselves as part of Danish society. The Danish community. Which is mentally tuned to a completely different frequency. Where information from imams, social media and the home country's media are weighted higher than instructions from the Danish authorities and consideration for the Danish citizens. So there is a crying need to stick to a strict immigration policy! And that is why it is a tragedy when the Social Democratic government and its supporting parties break through on the repatriation policy, which the DF had to struggle through in the last election period.

54537.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly letter <U+0096> Monday 16 January 2017 This week: Trump and Brexit This week two exciting things are happening. On Friday, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the President of the United States<U+0092>. And a lot can be said about the man, but he does not come across as particularly diplomatic. On the contrary, he has a habit of saying things bluntly. It can create friction, but it can also be refreshing. Like when he called Taiwan's president and thus defied mighty China. Or like now when he tells in an interview how he sees German Chancellor Angela Merkel's handling of the refugee and migrant flows to Europe. He makes it clear that it has been disastrous for Europe, and he believes that it is a decisive reason for the British exit from the EU. And exactly <U+0094>Brexit<U+0094> is the other important thing this week. Because tomorrow, Tuesday, the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will give a long-awaited speech in which she is expected to reveal how she sees Britain leaving the EU. For <U+0094>Brexit<U+0094> means exit from the EU. Naturally. The British people have spoken and voted for the country to leave the EU. Now the process of implementing the decision begins. This is how a democracy works. The speech is eagerly awaited. Until now, the cards have been held close to the body when the questions have been about how the process should take place. A complicated process awaits. There are quite a few political and legal issues that need to be clarified. What about the open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which in future will also be an EU border? What will the reaction be like in Scotland, where those fighting for Scottish secession from the UK will use the situation to try to get another referendum on just that. There is enough to deal with for the British Prime Minister. It is immediately expected that the British government will go for a so-called <U+0094>Hard Brexit<U+0094>, where the country leaves the EU<U+0092>'s Internal Market and the EU<U+0092>'s Customs Union. To ensure that Britain can regain control of immigration policy and British borders. It is also expected that the UK will endeavor to enter into free trade agreements worldwide as soon as possible. The minister responsible for the Brexit process, David Davis, has thus clearly expressed that the British government will first of all respect the result of the British referendum and take back control of the country's laws and immigration policy. Actually, it seems obvious that if the British politicians are to respect the referendum, the control of immigration must return to the British Parliament. Thus ALSO the immigration from Eastern Europe. This also means that it is the EU<U+0092>'s position that a country only participates in the internal market if it accepts free immigration, which is the deciding factor. But this knob should be removed! It is in Denmark's <U+0096> and should also be in the EU<U+0092>'s interest to ensure that the UK continues to participate in the single market. And the issue of free movement should not stand in the way of that. There are two ways to go. The pragmatic path, where Britain continues to participate in the single market, but can regulate immigration itself. Or the EU that has so far decided where to actually punish the British because they have dared to challenge the sacred principle of <U+0094>an ever narrower union<U+0094>, where more EU is always the solution any problem. It is well known in Brussels that the British politicians cannot negotiate an agreement at home which continues to give the EU influence on immigration to Great Britain! Then they would obviously not respect the referendum. I wonder if the EU should speculate a little on the frustration that exists in many populations. If the EU wants to retain any relevance in relation to the European population, it is crucial that one takes advantage of this and adjusts the policy accordingly. Otherwise, popular support for the EU will further decline. We may already see signs of this in the spring in the French presidential election. Or in the autumn at the German Bundestag election? Great Britain is a close and important ally and an important export market for Denmark. This should also be the case in the future. I believe that Denmark should take the lead in ensuring that any thought of <U+0094>punishing<U+0094> the British is completely dropped. The EU summit has tried to tie a Gordian knot towards the UK - to avoid a country successfully opting out. The former Liberal government unfortunately took part in tying the knot. The question now is whether the entry of the Conservatives and the Liberal Alliance into the government has changed anything on that point. Or they want to participate in the <U+0094>adult bullying<U+0094> that is supposed to take place against the British. I believe, of course, that the Danish government must first and foremost secure Denmark's interests. And I have no doubt: A good Brexit deal for the British is also a good deal for Denmark!

55506.0," In Berlingske's <U+0094>Groft sagt<U+0094> yesterday, Klaus Kj√∏ller wrote under the heading <U+0094>Iraqi people's meeting<U+0094> among other things: <U+0094>The people's meeting is proof that we have a well-functioning democracy. The Folkem√∏det clearly shows to everyone what it is that makes real democracy possible: comradeship. This common understanding that democracy is only possible if you are also good comrades is totally missing in so-called democracies such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Egypt. If Iraq held a People's Meeting in Allinge, then the whole of Bornholm would be transformed into a war zone after a few minutes, solely because the participants are unable to gossip and laugh together over a draft beer.<U+0094> ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The just finished People's Meeting on Bornholm was definitely a positive experience. I want to say that very loudly. I would also like to say thank you to all those who helped make the Folkem√∏det a pleasure to participate in. Thank you to the Danish Association of the Blind for the fun bike ride on a tandem with your chairman. Thanks to the Danish Nature Conservation Society and the Cancer Society for the good run on Friday morning. Thanks to Annette Heick for the duet on stage on Saturday (<U+0094>Bornholm, Bornholm, Bornholm<U+0094>), it was an unforgettable experience! And thanks to the teachers for the talk about the primary school, the good people of the Elderly Association about the conditions of the elderly in Denmark in 2014 and many, many more! Around Allinge and the surrounding area, many good talks and discussions took place. They took place in completely different ways than they would have done if people had met at a table in a meeting room at Christiansborg. Without using too many words, I would say that it is democratic dialogue at its best. The <U+0094>political workshop<U+0094> which the People's Meeting really is is functioning. Discussions are held in a relaxed atmosphere and people listen to each other. It creates community and cohesion and is largely one of the things that is so wonderful about Danish democracy and people's government. It is thought-provoking that something will happen on Thursday in N√∏rrebro in Copenhagen, which may have great significance for the future cohesion <U+0096> of our future people's government. Denmark's first large mosque with minaret, dome and everything will be inaugurated. Unfortunately, I believe that such a large mosque and the several of its kind that are predicted to be on the way will tend to reinforce the formation of parallel societies in Denmark. It is important to bear in mind that a large part of the funds for the great mosque, which has cost approximately 150 million to build, comes from Qatar. Qatar in particular is known for a particularly strict version of Islam, just as some of the main donors to the extreme Salafists come from Qatar. If you combine this with the fact that the association behind the great mosque, the Danish Islamic Council, is, according to the media, closely linked to the organization The Muslim Brotherhood, yes, then there is serious cause for concern. Imam Youssef al-Qaradawi has a key position in the Muslim Brotherhood, and one must understand that here you have a person who, among other things, believes that the Holocaust was Allah's punishment for the Jews, that apostates from Islam must be executed and many other disgusting things . There is no shortage of warnings against the Muslim Brotherhood in particular. This is how it sounded from the recognized expert in Islamism and political violence, Lorenzo G. Vidino, barely a year ago in Ekstra Bladet: <U+0094>Many aspects of the Brotherhood's ideology are negative and controversial in a Western society, e.g. their view on integration, women, religious freedom and homosexuality. If you follow them in Europe, it will lead to parallel societies and increased radicalization<U+0094>. Naturally, the people behind the great mosque reject any accusation that on Thursday we will experience the inauguration of a bridgehead for the spread of an extreme version of Islam in Denmark. It's not surprising, and it's almost in their job description that they have to say that, regardless of their intentions. That does not change the fact that there is a lot to be worried about. And I do not at all like the risk of rabid imams preaching on Danish soil and thus having the opportunity to draw Muslims living here towards Islamism and away from Denmark and Danish values. Danish politicians are well aware that there may be cause for concern about the upcoming large mosque. This is probably why they largely stay away from the opening on Thursday. It is all the more disappointing that there has been no political will to stop this large mosque. In the Danish People's Party, we believe that there are a number of options that must be investigated and possibly used to stop the construction of large mosques in Denmark, but we cannot get the other parties to join us. Instead, they wash their hands in advance by not showing up to the opening, so that they are not in a pinch if it turns out that the Great Mosque will not be what the originators express at all. It's not impressive. If we are to ensure integration and cohesion, it is not enough for the country's politicians to run around the Folkem√∏det on Bornholm and participate in democratic dialogue, although that is of course important. It also requires the same politicians to show courage. Courage to speak out when there is a great risk that Islamists are on their way to gaining a stronger platform here in Denmark. We do not want that. We love our democracy and people's government, as it was expressed on Bornholm!

55520.0," I would like to say a big thank you to all our candidates, volunteers and generally all those who have worked hard for the great result! And then, of course, a big thank you must go to all the Danes who voted for us! I can promise that we will do everything to ensure that the votes are managed with great humility and gratitude. We also know very well that there are Danes who in this election have voted for DF for the first time <U+0096> also some who do not normally do so in general elections. Therefore, the result of this election cannot be transferred to a parliamentary situation either. But we certainly also feel obliged by that. Because it means that there are Danes who, when it comes to the EU, see the Danish People's Party as the party that best expresses their position. Danes who have asked us to manage their interests in relation to the EU case! Although we in DF probably walk around and smile a little more today than we usually do, we are already in full swing with work. Thus, our leading candidate and vote-getter Morten Messerschmidt is already going to Brussels today, where he will negotiate which group in the European Parliament DF's four mandates will be a part of for the next five years. With the election, the Danes have sent a clear signal that they want a different path in EU politics. They want more Denmark and less EU. Moreover, the election results in a number of other countries clearly show that more and more Europeans want a different course for the EU. It is really high time that the European politicians listen to the people of Europe. I guess it's safe to say that they should have done this a long time ago! Speaking of listening, I also really hope that certain parties do a thorough analysis of their campaigns. Because it shows to a great extent that the Danes have not been influenced by the so-called negative campaigns. The Danes would rather hear what the parties' policies are and what the politicians stand for than they want to hear negative scare pictures of and mudslinging against the other parties and their politicians. I believe that, on the part of the Danish People's Party, we have conducted a serious and sober election campaign and it should also be such that you win the trust of the Danes. But unfortunately I fear that certain other parties and organizations are not learning. For example, last night we saw Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, again and again, use her speaking time to long for the Danish People's Party instead of talking about her own policy. Just as she suddenly blamed the Left <U+0094> for the DF's great election. Unbelievable! But it is therefore gratifying that the negative campaigns have not worked. Thus, yesterday's election was another defeat in a long series for the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt's leadership. One thing, however, you have to give Helle Thorning-Schmidt. That regardless of the number of electoral defeats, she can pretend that everything is fine. As she said to Ritzau last night: <U+0094>Within a short time we have now had two elections, and twice we have now shown that the rumors about the demise and misery of the Social Democrats are greatly exaggerated<U+0094>. No, of course the Social Democrats have not gone away, but the misery is there! Thus it probably speaks for itself that the election is the seventh election in a row with a decline for the Social Democrats with Helle Thorning-Schmidt as chairman. For the Danes, it is primarily about politics. About knowing what the parties and candidates stand for, and then we put our cross next to the party and the candidate with which we most agree. That's how it is, and that's how it should be. Especially when it comes to EU policy, many are happily aligned with the Danish People's Party, and this was reflected in the great election yesterday.

53678.0," Today is May 1st. International Workers' Day. You can also say wage earners' day. I hope that all of you who celebrate May 1 and use the day to participate in various events have a good and fruitful day. Even if it will be a little different this year due to the corona. I think there is reason for us to send a special thank you today to all the people in the healthcare system, elderly care and elsewhere who work more directly with the vulnerable and the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to the corona. We face a colossal challenge. Both health-wise and financially. For all of us, it is about limiting the spread of infection. But a lot of people are also nervous about losing their jobs. Many have become unemployed, and the fear is that many more will become unemployed in the coming months. Therefore, we must do everything we can to ensure that Danish society gets through the crisis as gently as possible. We have already made large aid packages with salary compensation etc., but more aid packages will definitely be needed - and to continuously convert the aid packages into something else that works in the slightly longer term. We have a special responsibility to ensure that we use Danish labor in Denmark. Therefore, it is completely incomprehensible to me that from 1 July the government wants to open up the Danish labor market to more skilled foreign labor from third world countries. It is the completely wrong way to go at a time of increasing unemployment at home. My clear appeal to the government is: Put those plans away! Instead, let's focus on getting the unemployed Danes back to work. And finally, I would like to say that on a day like today there must also be room to discuss other things than what is solely corona-related. One thing that is quite obvious to discuss is Arne and the issue of earlier pensions for worn-out people. It has been over a year since the Social Democrats launched the idea that Arne and other downtrodden people should have the right to an earlier pension. But here on 1 May 2020, we still haven't been allowed to see what the government wants to implement. But we have heard that the government has a finished proposal lying in the drawer. A finished model. My appeal to Mette Frederiksen and the government is: Take the proposal out of the drawer. Let's see it. Let's discuss together whether it is the right demarcation you have made and whether it is the right way to set up a pension system for the downtrodden. Although it is not certain that we can get it done this spring, we can discuss together whether you have hit the target, or whether we should come up with something else. It is an important agenda. Let's get the proposal on the table. With these words, I would like to wish everyone a happy May Day.

56691.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly letter ‚Äì Monday 1 July 2013 Reform frenzy <U+0096> No, take it easy! A quite eventful parliamentary year has come to an end. Lots and lots happened in Danish politics. I think that the historians end up using the word <U+0094>reforms<U+0094> quite a few times when they have to summarize both this year <U+0096> but also the previous three or four years. And it is true that many of the changes that S and SF were staunch opponents of before the 2011 election have now been implemented with the very same parties at the helm. However, the political season also offered other things. For example, change of chairman in two parties. Each in their very own way. After a turbulent time in the autumn, we got a finance law, where the government's support party Enhedslisten, after the negotiations had ended, refused to stand by the finance minister. It has probably never happened before that you have been so embarrassed by an agreement that you have not been able to present it together out in front of the famous glass door. A radical culture minister resigned, a former party chairman joined. Mining in Greenland suddenly became a hot topic, which the government is still trying hard to avoid getting close to. A teacher conflict, in which the teachers were eventually beaten, also happened, and I wonder if most people had and still have the clear opinion that the script for the conflict was written by the government and KL long before the conflict was even close to begin? This meant, among other things, that the otherwise traditional celebration day for the left wing, May 1, ended up being a day that most people in the government would rather just forget. Denmark got a new, but definitely not better, publicity act. The Darkening Act was renamed! And then we again got a number of relaxations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãforeigners, which means that even more foreigners are now applying to Denmark. Already in 2012, the number of asylum seekers broke a record compared to 2002, when VOK tightened the rules. And in 2013, the number looks set to grow further. After more asylum seekers usually come more family reunifications. It will cost Denmark and the Danes. Both in relation to conflicts, when we cannot manage to get the immigrants integrated sufficiently, but also financially in relation to the large amount of money it costs Danish society. Speaking of money, despite the many events mentioned above, and I have even left out many, the parliamentary year will most likely be remembered for the word <U+0094>reform-amok<U+0094>. According to a dictionary, the word <U+0094>amok<U+0094> means either <U+0094>furious<U+0094> or <U+0094>crazy<U+0094>. The exact opposite of <U+0094>calm<U+0094> or <U+0094>wise<U+0094>. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (S) declared at a world economic summit in Davos in Switzerland back in January that Denmark had gone <U+0094>reform-amok<U+0094>. Contrary to popular belief, Thorning actually thought it was a good thing. And it went fast. It did it. Maybe too strong? Shortly after the meeting in Davos, the government presented proposals for an SU reform, a cash assistance reform, a job creation package and a plan for faster train traffic in the space of two weeks. If ordinary Danes with busy everyday lives found it difficult to keep up, there was not the least to say about it. Because the journalists and politicians were busy, and a DR editor stated that <U+0094>The government has had a crazy pace of reform<U+0094>. The editor's words are completely correct, because it is not a wise way in which the government has run the reform race. In part, far from all the government's reforms have been equally wise. In part, it has simply gone too fast. The problem is that the Danes are currently holding on to the money, and this means that the wheels turn slowly, so to speak. The Danes buy less, and that means less in the order books of the companies, which in turn need less labour. So we are talking about a negative spiral, and the right way to reverse the trend is no more reform frenzy that makes Danes insecure about what the politicians are up to. Politicians should keep that in mind before they come forward again with reforms, reforms and yet more reforms. In the Danish People's Party, we believe that the welfare society must be continuously adjusted so that we can maintain a safe welfare society in the time to come. But it requires timely care, and it should be done at a pace that is fair to the population. It is important that we give the Danes security in a time of low growth and economic crisis. And we do that by giving the Danes an assurance that, from a political point of view, we are not fundamentally changing society every two months.

55250.0," The gap between politicians and the population must be narrowed! The gap is expressed in many areas. But i.a. in the EU area, there is a huge democratic deficit. For many years, an overwhelming majority in the Folketing almost could not get enough of the EU, while the population has had a somewhat more realistic and pragmatic view of how EU cooperation should develop. For example, think back to the vote on the euro in September 2000. A large majority for the euro in the Folketing, but a clear majority of the Danish population to keep the krone. A decision that more and more have become supporters of as the years have gone by. Or simply look back to the month of December, when a majority said no thanks to abolishing the reservation of rights - although here too there was a large majority in favor in the Folketing. But the above does not only apply in Denmark. In many EU countries, there is a big difference between how the politicians and the population view the EU. Last week, the Dutch voted no to an EU agreement with Ukraine. The Dutch could because of a new law which allows for indicative referendums to be required. A satirical magazine seized that opportunity and, via a campaign on the Internet, secured the 300,000 signatures needed to trigger a referendum. A vote that neither the Dutch government nor the EU system really cared about. Of course, the President of the EU Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, found it right to interfere in the Dutch vote and warn against the consequences of a no vote, and probably also confirmed many Dutch's suspicions about an EU elite far removed from the reality of the people's everyday life. Despite the many warnings, it was a no. And I wonder if it was a result of the fact that when a population finally gets the opportunity to vote for the EU, yes, this opportunity is used to show dissatisfaction with the course that the EU is leading. The Netherlands (also France, by the way) actually voted no thanks to the EU's constitutional treaty in 2005. The vote at the time sent shockwaves through the EU system, but the shock was not used to narrow the gap ‚Äì rather to consider how to convince the population that they were wrong. Later, the content of the treaty also came through. Under a different name and bypassing the populations! There really is a need for a fundamental recognition that our democracy rests on a shared understanding of the direction in which Denmark should go. If this understanding is not present, tensions will arise which undermine the cohesion of our society. This applies in the EU area as in other areas. For example, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration, where many Danes also feel that there is a development underway which consistently undermines the Denmark that is cherished. Everyone who cares about our country with its democracy and people's government must have the same interest. So let's get started and thereby reduce the gap between politicians and the population. It is urgent! ",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The speech demands that state policies favor native Danes and accuses mainstream institutions of bias.

56873.0," The temporary border control has been extended several times since it was first introduced on 4 January 2016. But at the latest in just over three months, on 12 November, it must be over, if it is up to the EU Commission. The Greek EU Commissioner for Migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, confirmed this in connection with the latest extension in May: ""This will be the last extension. I repeat: This is the last extension‚Äù. With the EU commissioner's blunt announcement, it is to be expected that border control will be the subject of another heated debate this autumn. The Danish People's Party's point of view is well known. We want a permanent and more comprehensive border control. A check where there are sufficient manpower assisted by modern technology present at the borders and where asylum seekers can be rejected at the border itself. Border control is crucial to ensure the security of Denmark and the Danes, and so it marks where Denmark begins and ends. Border control is an indispensable safeguard against migration pressure on Europe, the pending terrorist threat and cross-border crime. A new investigation by Radio24syv has shown that one in four who were remanded in custody for crime and produced in Copenhagen's Dommervagt in March 2017 already had an entry ban. 28 of those remanded in custody were Eastern European citizens, nine of whom had an entry ban. It illustrates with all desirable clarity that we need more and not less border control. The Danes must be able to feel secure in the fact that the authorities have control over who is allowed in. And if a foreigner has an entry ban, it must of course be enforced. I therefore also do not have the imagination to imagine that any Danish government will abolish border control, which has proved its worth to that extent. The discussion about border control is actually quite strange. In the time that preceded the abolition of border controls in 2001, people did not question whether passport control worked or not. It was considered a matter of course, on the same level as locking your front door, i.e. as common sense. An argument that is often heard from opponents of border controls is that there is no point in having controls. It must be understood that illegal immigrants and criminals will find their way to Denmark regardless. This ""bankruptcy argument"" is hard to take seriously. Should we also drop precautions against burglars, referring to the fact that there will always be burglars? It's absurd. Another argument opponents of border control often use is that border barriers are old-fashioned and must be replaced entirely by international police cooperation. But why is it an either or? In the Danish People's Party, we want both. For that reason, among other things, we recommended that the Danes vote no to the abolition of the reservation of rights on 3 December 2015 and instead go for a special agreement regarding Europol. It succeeded, and therefore Denmark is still only in Schengen on an intergovernmental basis, which means that we ourselves decide whether we want to leave Schengen and establish permanent border controls. That's how it was before we made the special agreement on Europol. That's how it is after as well. And that's why it was a good deal we made here this year. Every country should have the right and the benefit of both border control and the reasonable exchange of information about the behavior of criminals. Just because Great Britain has opted out of the EU, one does not imagine that they will be left out of international police cooperation. In the same way, the Schengen cooperation should be flexible enough that we can both introduce permanent border controls and be associated with Europol, if we so wish. A Danish government should at all times defend the Danes' right to self-determination and to protect themselves from external dangers. The Danish People's Party will continue to remind the government of this.

55070.0,"(The spoken word applies.) Thank you very much for turning up in large numbers again this year. It's something that feels good. You should know that. Won't the sun peek out again in a little while? We are gathered here at Lykkesholm Castle. The castle's history goes back a full 600 years. In 1391, Queen Margrethe 1 owned the castle for a short period. H.C. Andersen spent many summers here. In 1835, he described the place as follows: ""The romantic Lykkesholm, the most beautiful place I know in Funen, where you eat quite excellently, and you can have as much wine and sweet cream as you want..."" Or how about this quote: ‚ÄúMy stomach says; what food can't you get at Lykkesholm! Hot lunch, wonderful wine and good beds. Shouldn't you listen to your stomach? It's the centre, though!"". Mage for a positive outlook on life!‚Äî‚Äî Well. Before I get too started... I have to remember that! A special welcome to all the girls today. Were you busy this morning? Did you remember that? I can ask the men. Did you have breakfast in bed? A small gift perhaps? Yes, yes... it's dad's today. And aren't there many fathers present? So girls! Can you just turn to the men and wish them luck. Give them a hug. Yes, now this shouldn't develop into the Alternative... And to you, who haven't reached it: The day is still long.... So the gift can still be reached. It's Father's Day all day.‚Äî‚Äî We're having a good time here. H.C. Andersen had a good time here. Hygge! It's really Danish. In these years, other countries are trying to translate the Danish hygge to their country. Many are trying to copy Denmark. Quite difficult. , that we basically feel good here in our country. Therefore it is also natural that many others would like to copy our ""comfort"". The strange thing is, in reality, that while other countries look enviously at Denmark, there are parties here in the country that wants to fundamentally change Denmark. Liberal Alliance is such a party. They want a fundamental economic change. A much more unequal society. People must fend for themselves. Much less must be managed via our common welfare society. Enhedslisten, Radikale Venstre and Alternativet .They will open the door to tens of thousands of migrants every year, who must be allowed to immigrate to Denmark. This will decisively change the community we otherwise feel with each other here in Denmark. Up through the 90s, in Denmark we had years of up to 20,000 migrants who came. From 2001 we achieved a dramatic decrease, so that significantly fewer migrants came to Denmark in the years up to 2011. But then she came - what is her name now? You know, the one who immediately applied abroad after she lost the election? Well - yes. Of course....Helle Thorning-Schmidt... It's like bad weather, you forget it quickly. And then she came in 2011. And then the numbers increased again year by year and exploded in the autumn of 2015 with over 21,000 migrants immigrating to our country. In 2016 and here in 2017, immigration has been controlled again. 1. quarter this year is thus the lowest since the third quarter of 2008.‚Äî‚Äî And it is quite simple: In the 90s, the Danish People's Party had no influence. From 2001 to 2011 we had a decisive influence. a side track. In 2016 and here in 2017, we again have the decisive influence. Recovery after decades of failed immigration policy takes time. The Ministry of Finance recently calculated that non-Western immigration to Denmark burdens the public coffers with DKK 33 billion annually. This is where the decisive factor problem is! So when we discuss 2025 plans. So-called room for maneuver until 2025 of DKK 35 billion. So a burden every single year of DKK 33 billion is clearly a far greater challenge than what the room for maneuver can perhaps be expanded a clue. The Rockwall Foundation has documented in an analysis that tightening immigration policy actually works. We know that well. But there are politicians in Christiansborg who do not listen to us, but would rather listen to so-called experts. But these politicians can now read in black and white partly the Ministry of Finance's calculation of the costs for primarily the people who have come to Denmark via the asylum system and the family reunification system - partly the Rockwall Foundation's analysis that austerity measures work in relation to how many come here. That is why there is a difference in how many come when the Danish People's Party has influence and when we don't. That there is a difference in how many come when the radicals, the Alternative and Enhedslisten have influence and when they don't. And let me make it absolutely clear: As a country, we cannot tolerate that there will be new 4-year periods in which the Danish People's Party is excluded from influence. Where again an increasing number will come to Denmark primarily from the Middle East and North Africa. That is why we must also have wrested the Social Democracy out of the clutches of the radicals, the alternative and the unity list. And the Social Democracy must guarantee the Danes that, regardless of the political price, these three parties will never again have an influence on Danish immigration policy! We simply must have ensured that the immigration policy is ALWAYS made in the future with us. Only in this way can we ensure that we hand over a decent Denmark to future generations!‚Äî‚Äî There is a lot to do. And we know very well that it takes time. There are simply too grotesque examples of a wrong policy. That the courts considered that Levakovic could not be extradited from Denmark because of his human rights was grotesque. It is also grotesque that the Supreme Court reached the conclusion last week that 4 Romanians could not be repatriated for a trial on human trafficking. These 4 EU citizens from the EU country Romania is considered to be involved in a huge case of human trafficking. They should have exploited some of the most vulnerable in the most despicable way. But when the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that they cannot be deported, it is because they become convicted of their misdeeds, there will be no guarantee that they will have a large enough private room available in the prison while they serve their sentence. Yes ‚Äì you heard right! Human rights therefore protect these people from prosecution in their own country. An EU country. Because the room in the prison - AFTER they have been sentenced, if applicable - is not considered to be large enough. That is grotesque. And I must strongly urge the government to step up and get that matter resolved .These Romanians MUST be deported by Denmark. They have absolutely NOTHING to do in this country. And quite frankly. If they have done what they are accused of, I don't care how much private space they subsequently have in a Romanian prison! These people should not be a burden to Danish taxpayers. These people should be sent home. ‚Äî‚Äî It seems completely wrong that we should have free movement of citizens from countries to which we cannot deport them when they are accused of serious crime. It doesn't work! It is also examples like these that have caused the British to say stop. To want to opt out of the EU. The anger at an EU summit that does not hear the signals from the people. There is far from an English working in north-west England, who has lost his job to an Eastern European, and then to the EU Commission in the palace in Brussels. But Brexit should be an eye-opener. Should make all the alarm bells ring. Make the EU change its saddle decisively. But no On the contrary. In the EU, there is serious talk now that the pace can be increased - now that the stubborn British are on their way out. And the arrogance continues to shine from the top of the EU. For example, Jean-Claude Juncker. Chairman of the EU Commission. He said with great joy in the voice after Brexit: ""Slowly but surely English is losing its importance in Europe."" That probably around 1 billion people in the world speak English. That it is the common language when people meet across national borders - also in Europe Also in the European Parliament. And in the EU in general. It was passed over. The desire to say something negative about the recalcitrant British was so great that such nonsense came out of his mouth.‚Äî‚Äî- At the same time, EU Commission President Juncker has sought to undermine support for British Prime Minister Theresa May here before the election on Thursday by leaking from a confidential dinner conversation. After the dinner, Juncker and his people had leaked that he considered Theresa May a woman ""who lives in a distant galaxy"". It was an attempt to undermine the most central person, which is otherwise expected to negotiate Brexit on behalf of Great Britain. But it was a distasteful way of doing it. I think we should make a clear call to the non-elected EU commissioners: Get involved outside of the British election Thursday. The British do it best themselves. Concentrate on how you get out of your own distant galaxy so that you can better serve the populations of Europe you were put in the world to serve. ‚Äî‚Äî- Speaking of the British .On Brexit. What is the Danish interest? What should Denmark fight for here? We must ensure continued free trade with the British. We have many companies that have great interests in Great Britain. For example, our entire agricultural sector actually has very great interests in being able to sell to Great Britain. That is why we must ask the question: What is more important to us? Free trade or free movement of EU citizens. The answer is screamingly simple! It is free trade! Yet the EU has decided that there should only be free trade if the British at the same time accept free immigration from, among other things, Eastern Europe. That is the really big problem. This linking of free trade and free immigration. The EU summit already decided 6 days after the British vote on 23 June last year to stand firm on this interconnection. And it is this that has led the British to go for a so-called ""hard Brexit"", where they then opt out of the single market as well. But from here the message is clear: Denmark should change course. Denmark should announce the other EU countries that we want to remove this linkage. That we want maximum free trade with our British friends - and that we do not link this with a demand for free movement of Eastern Europeans among others. Because of course the British themselves have to decide on their own border and who they want into their country. That is every country's right, by the way.‚Äî‚Äî- Brexit must not be used to turbocharge the EU towards ""an ever narrower union"", as the treaty otherwise states. It will bring the EU even further away from the people. Even a super-European and federalist supporter like Professor Uffe √òstergaard has seen the writing on the wall. In Berlingske at the beginning of May, one could read: ""It has been a big problem for the EU that the EU have spoken as if you were a state without being one. And there I have great respect for the voters. They can obviously see through the false tone when the government leaders come out and say they have a plan that everyone can hear is pure wishful thinking. Uffe √òstergaard describes it as a ""shock"" for optimists like himself, when they realized how big the differences between societies in Western and Eastern Europe really are. He points out, for example, that the minimum wage in Bulgaria is lower than the child benefit in Denmark. He says in the article, ""In particular, the free movement of labor turned out to be a revolutionary principle. Originally it was thought that it would concern men aged 20-40, but then it also included women, who became families, who became unemployed , which led to illegal immigrants gaining social rights. There is an overall clash between the populations, which have become more national.‚Äù If the EU leaders don't want to listen to us, can they not listen to someone like Uffe √òstergaard? An ardent supporter of the EU. A man who has understood that the current development is completely unsustainable! So from here it should read: Thank you, Uffe √òstergaard .Thank you for finally taking the leaf out of your mouth.‚Äî‚Äî- We must stick together in our country. In Denmark. I began with considerations about the word ""hygge"". Hygge in Danish. Like here at Lykkesholm Castle today. Like in those nursing homes around the country, where from now on the smell of delicious food will be wanted, while the table is covered with a tablecloth and candles. Like when I visited a nursing home in Aalborg recently and my sidekick at the lunch table answered Nordjutske's journalist's question about why it was now so important with all this around food. And the good nursing home resident replied: Yes ‚Äì because when it's nice, then a mouthful more smoke goes down. That answer said it all!‚Äî‚Äì Or the coziness at the police station, when we've been trained so many more officers that at the station after a long shift they have time to sit down with a lemon moon and a cup of coffee and give each other a smile. Before they go out again to ensure the safety of all of us. And the German tourist on his way over the border to Denmark, heading towards the summer house on the west coast, meets the friendly border guard, who nods and welcomes to a Denmark that offers security in a world unfortunately full of the opposite. And when we ensure that the hospital staff have time to also provide care and presence for those of our fellow citizens who fall ill and have to be treated in a hospital. And have the small surplus in everyday life that is needed to create a little ""joy"" - the little smile - even in a situation, even in that situation where you are otherwise uneasy about what lies ahead.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì It requires a long, tough move to secure the Denmark we care about. There are forces both within and outside the country's borders that want to destroy the Denmark we know. And we have just seen it again in London. A few weeks ago we saw it in Manchester. Before that, Stockholm, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Brussels. For many, it is the beginning of daily life. There is dismay, yes of course. There is distancing .But at the same time: Well, where was it this time? It creeps into our lives. We live on. Not as if nothing has happened. But still, in a strange way, a bit as if... Maybe that's the really scary thing. It was reported from the English embassy in Copenhagen yesterday that there were not that many flowers. There were a few more after the terror in Manchester. Many more after the previous terrorist attacks. Politicians and opinion leaders distance themselves from terror. Of course. At the same time it means that we have to live on as we usually do. Otherwise the terrorists will have won, it is said. And of course there is something to be said. But what is decisive for people in general to be able to live on as they usually do is that we politicians make the decisions that in the future can help ensure our security. It is typically fanatical Islamists who threaten our security. Some of them come as travelers to our countries. But we have seen that the terrorists often come from the parallel societies , which has unfortunately arisen in the Western countries. Areas where it is difficult to rediscover Western culture and our values. Areas where Middle Eastern medieval customs are allowed to be decisive. We saw it ourselves in the documentary program TV2 broadcast a year ago since ""Mosques behind the veil"". Such a broadcast could undoubtedly be made again today. It is a huge problem. These people are so inspired by people abroad. Both by the Islamic State's call for death and destruction on the so-called ""infidels"". But also by travelers. We must have fought that evil. Both where the Islamic State has tried to gain a foothold, in Syria and Iraq, where our soldiers are making a huge effort. But also by making it more difficult for these people to travel around. And we do that, among other things, with border control. And then we must have fought the parallel societies. We do that, among other things, by the fact that for decades there will be very few new migrants. At the same time that we tighten the course towards those who already are here. Criminals must be deported. People who, for example, preach death to Jews must be stopped. They must not be allowed to incite new terrorist attacks against innocents. Innocents such as the children and young people who in Manchester never came out to their waiting parents after the concert. The young people who became victims of the terror. There is enough to be done. There is enough to be done to secure our society. Our way of life. So it just doesn't come by itself. The generations before us have built a fantastically nice country to live in. This little spot on mother earth. We must not accept that this place will be destroyed in a few decades. The Constitution that we celebrate today is a good foundation for our nation. A good foundation for our country ‚Äì for our Commonwealth. But the Constitution also only provides the foundation. It is what is built on top of it in everyday life that determines our future. Whether there is also to be fun in Denmark in the future. As I have discussed, things can progress, if not we in the Danish People's Party have the decisive influence on the development of our country. That is why you are important! Because you are our ambassadors. You carry the message around the country. You have a large part of the credit for the fact that the Danish People's Party today is to be avoided. A party that the others are forced to listen to. Let's celebrate it today. Together with the birthday of the Constitution. A good birthday for a proud nation, where we together secure the future of that country, which we love so much. Will you get up and together with me live a threefold life for the Constitution and for our lovely country, which we will fight for is also a pleasant place to be in the future.

It was an attempt to undermine the most central person, which is otherwise expected to negotiate Brexit on behalf of Great Britain. But it was a distasteful way of doing it. I think we should make a clear call to the non-elected EU commissioners: Get involved outside of the British election Thursday. The British do it best themselves. Concentrate on how you get out of your own distant galaxy so that you can better serve the populations of Europe you were put in the world to serve. ‚Äî‚Äî- Speaking of the British .On Brexit. What is the Danish interest? What should Denmark fight for here? We must ensure continued free trade with the British. We have many companies that have great interests in Great Britain. For example, our entire agricultural sector actually has very great interests in being able to sell to Great Britain. That is why we must ask the question: What is more important to us? Free trade or free movement of EU citizens. The answer is screamingly simple! It is free trade! Yet the EU has decided that there should only be free trade if the British at the same time accept free immigration from, among other things, Eastern Europe. That is the really big problem. This linking of free trade and free immigration. The EU summit already decided 6 days after the British vote on 23 June last year to stand firm on this interconnection. And it is this that has led the British to go for a so-called ""hard Brexit"", where they then opt out of the single market as well. But from here the message is clear: Denmark should change course. Denmark should announce the other EU countries that we want to remove this linkage. That we want maximum free trade with our British friends - and that we do not link this with a demand for free movement of Eastern Europeans among others. Because of course the British themselves have to decide on their own border and who they want into their country. That is every country's right, by the way.‚Äî‚Äî- Brexit must not be used to turbocharge the EU towards ""an ever narrower union"", as the treaty otherwise states. It will bring the EU even further away from the people. Even a super-European and federalist supporter like Professor Uffe √òstergaard has seen the writing on the wall. In Berlingske at the beginning of May, one could read: ""It has been a big problem for the EU that the EU have spoken as if you were a state without being one. And there I have great respect for the voters. They can obviously see through the false tone when the government leaders come out and say they have a plan that everyone can hear is pure wishful thinking. Uffe √òstergaard describes it as a ""shock"" for optimists like himself, when they realized how big the differences between societies in Western and Eastern Europe really are. He points out, for example, that the minimum wage in Bulgaria is lower than the child benefit in Denmark. He says in the article, ""In particular, the free movement of labor turned out to be a revolutionary principle. Originally it was thought that it would concern men aged 20-40, but then it also included women, who became families, who became unemployed , which led to illegal immigrants gaining social rights. There is an overall clash between the populations, which have become more national.‚Äù If the EU leaders don't want to listen to us, can they not listen to someone like Uffe √òstergaard? An ardent supporter of the EU. A man who has understood that the current development is completely unsustainable! So from here it should read: Thank you, Uffe √òstergaard .Thank you for finally taking the leaf out of your mouth.‚Äî‚Äî- We must stick together in our country. In Denmark. I began with considerations about the word ""hygge"". Hygge in Danish. Like here at Lykkesholm Castle today. Like in those nursing homes around the country, where from now on the smell of delicious food will be wanted, while the table is covered with a tablecloth and candles. Like when I visited a nursing home in Aalborg recently and my sidekick at the lunch table answered Nordjutske's journalist's question about why it was now so important with all this around food. And the good nursing home resident replied: Yes ‚Äì because when it's nice, then a mouthful more smoke goes down. That answer said it all!‚Äî‚Äì Or the coziness at the police station, when we've been trained so many more officers that at the station after a long shift they have time to sit down with a lemon moon and a cup of coffee and give each other a smile. Before they go out again to ensure the safety of all of us. And the German tourist on his way over the border to Denmark, heading towards the summer house on the west coast, meets the friendly border guard, who nods and welcomes to a Denmark that offers security in a world unfortunately full of the opposite. And when we ensure that the hospital staff have time to also provide care and presence for those of our fellow citizens who fall ill and have to be treated in a hospital. And have the small surplus in everyday life that is needed to create a little ""joy"" - the little smile - even in a situation, even in that situation where you are otherwise uneasy about what lies ahead.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì It requires a long, tough move to secure the Denmark we care about. There are forces both within and outside the country's borders that want to destroy the Denmark we know. And we have just seen it again in London. A few weeks ago we saw it in Manchester. Before that, Stockholm, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Brussels. For many, it is the beginning of daily life. There is dismay, yes of course. There is distancing .But at the same time: Well, where was it this time? It creeps into our lives. We live on. Not as if nothing has happened. But still, in a strange way, a bit as if... Maybe that's the really scary thing. It was reported from the English embassy in Copenhagen yesterday that there were not that many flowers. There were a few more after the terror in Manchester. Many more after the previous terrorist attacks. Politicians and opinion leaders distance themselves from terror. Of course. At the same time it means that we have to live on as we usually do. Otherwise the terrorists will have won, it is said. And of course there is something to be said. But what is decisive for people in general to be able to live on as they usually do is that we politicians make the decisions that in the future can help ensure our security. It is typically fanatical Islamists who threaten our security. Some of them come as travelers to our countries. But we have seen that the terrorists often come from the parallel societies , which has unfortunately arisen in the Western countries. Areas where it is difficult to rediscover Western culture and our values. Areas where Middle Eastern medieval customs are allowed to be decisive. We saw it ourselves in the documentary program TV2 broadcast a year ago since ""Mosques behind the veil"". Such a broadcast could undoubtedly be made again today. It is a huge problem. These people are so inspired by people abroad. Both by the Islamic State's call for death and destruction on the so-called ""infidels"". But also by travelers. We must have fought that evil. Both where the Islamic State has tried to gain a foothold, in Syria and Iraq, where our soldiers are making a huge effort. But also by making it more difficult for these people to travel around. And we do that, among other things, with border control. And then we must have fought the parallel societies. We do that, among other things, by the fact that for decades there will be very few new migrants. At the same time that we tighten the course towards those who already are here. Criminals must be deported. People who, for example, preach death to Jews must be stopped. They must not be allowed to incite new terrorist attacks against innocents. Innocents such as the children and young people who in Manchester never came out to their waiting parents after the concert. The young people who became victims of the terror. There is enough to be done. There is enough to be done to secure our society. Our way of life. So it just doesn't come by itself. The generations before us have built a fantastically nice country to live in. This little spot on mother earth. We must not accept that this place will be destroyed in a few decades. The Constitution that we celebrate today is a good foundation for our nation. A good foundation for our country ‚Äì for our Commonwealth. But the Constitution also only provides the foundation. It is what is built on top of it in everyday life that determines our future. Whether there is also to be fun in Denmark in the future. As I have discussed, things can progress, if not we in the Danish People's Party have the decisive influence on the development of our country. That is why you are important! Because you are our ambassadors. You carry the message around the country. You have a large part of the credit for the fact that the Danish People's Party today is to be avoided. A party that the others are forced to listen to. Let's celebrate it today. Together with the birthday of the Constitution. A good birthday for a proud nation, where we together secure the future of that country, which we love so much. Will you get up and together with me live a threefold life for the Constitution and for our lovely country, which we will fight for is also a pleasant place to be in the future.

55070.0,"(The spoken word applies.) Thank you very much for turning up in large numbers again this year. It's something that feels good. You should know that. Won't the sun peek out again in a little while? We are gathered here at Lykkesholm Castle. The castle's history goes back a full 600 years. In 1391, Queen Margrethe 1 owned the castle for a short period. H.C. Andersen spent many summers here. In 1835, he described the place as follows: ""The romantic Lykkesholm, the most beautiful place I know in Funen, where you eat quite excellently, and you can have as much wine and sweet cream as you want..."" Or how about this quote: ‚ÄúMy stomach says; what food can't you get at Lykkesholm! Hot lunch, wonderful wine and good beds. Shouldn't you listen to your stomach? It's the centre, though!"". Mage for a positive outlook on life!‚Äî‚Äî Well. Before I get too started... I have to remember that! A special welcome to all the girls today. Were you busy this morning? Did you remember that? I can ask the men. Did you have breakfast in bed? A small gift perhaps? Yes, yes... it's dad's today. And aren't there many fathers present? So girls! Can you just turn to the men and wish them luck. Give them a hug. Yes, now this shouldn't develop into the Alternative... And to you, who haven't reached it: The day is still long.... So the gift can still be reached. It's Father's Day all day.‚Äî‚Äî We're having a good time here. H.C. Andersen had a good time here. Hygge! It's really Danish. In these years, other countries are trying to translate the Danish hygge to their country. Many are trying to copy Denmark. Quite difficult. , that we basically feel good here in our country. Therefore it is also natural that many others would like to copy our ""comfort"". The strange thing is, in reality, that while other countries look enviously at Denmark, there are parties here in the country that wants to fundamentally change Denmark. Liberal Alliance is such a party. They want a fundamental economic change. A much more unequal society. People must fend for themselves. Much less must be managed via our common welfare society. Enhedslisten, Radikale Venstre and Alternativet .They will open the door to tens of thousands of migrants every year, who must be allowed to immigrate to Denmark. This will decisively change the community we otherwise feel with each other here in Denmark. Up through the 90s, in Denmark we had years of up to 20,000 migrants who came. From 2001 we achieved a dramatic decrease, so that significantly fewer migrants came to Denmark in the years up to 2011. But then she came - what is her name now? You know, the one who immediately applied abroad after she lost the election? Well - yes. Of course....Helle Thorning-Schmidt... It's like bad weather, you forget it quickly. And then she came in 2011. And then the numbers increased again year by year and exploded in the autumn of 2015 with over 21,000 migrants immigrating to our country. In 2016 and here in 2017, immigration has been controlled again. 1. quarter this year is thus the lowest since the third quarter of 2008.‚Äî‚Äî And it is quite simple: In the 90s, the Danish People's Party had no influence. From 2001 to 2011 we had a decisive influence. a side track. In 2016 and here in 2017, we again have the decisive influence. Recovery after decades of failed immigration policy takes time. The Ministry of Finance recently calculated that non-Western immigration to Denmark burdens the public coffers with DKK 33 billion annually. This is where the decisive factor problem is! So when we discuss 2025 plans. So-called room for maneuver until 2025 of DKK 35 billion. So a burden every single year of DKK 33 billion is clearly a far greater challenge than what the room for maneuver can perhaps be expanded a clue. The Rockwall Foundation has documented in an analysis that tightening immigration policy actually works. We know that well. But there are politicians in Christiansborg who do not listen to us, but would rather listen to so-called experts. But these politicians can now read in black and white partly the Ministry of Finance's calculation of the costs for primarily the people who have come to Denmark via the asylum system and the family reunification system - partly the Rockwall Foundation's analysis that austerity measures work in relation to how many come here. That is why there is a difference in how many come when the Danish People's Party has influence and when we don't. That there is a difference in how many come when the radicals, the Alternative and Enhedslisten have influence and when they don't. And let me make it absolutely clear: As a country, we cannot tolerate that there will be new 4-year periods in which the Danish People's Party is excluded from influence. Where again an increasing number will come to Denmark primarily from the Middle East and North Africa. That is why we must also have wrested the Social Democracy out of the clutches of the radicals, the alternative and the unity list. And the Social Democracy must guarantee the Danes that, regardless of the political price, these three parties will never again have an influence on Danish immigration policy! We simply must have ensured that the immigration policy is ALWAYS made in the future with us. Only in this way can we ensure that we hand over a decent Denmark to future generations!‚Äî‚Äî There is a lot to do. And we know very well that it takes time. There are simply too grotesque examples of a wrong policy. That the courts considered that Levakovic could not be extradited from Denmark because of his human rights was grotesque. It is also grotesque that the Supreme Court reached the conclusion last week that 4 Romanians could not be repatriated for a trial on human trafficking. These 4 EU citizens from the EU country Romania is considered to be involved in a huge case of human trafficking. They should have exploited some of the most vulnerable in the most despicable way. But when the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that they cannot be deported, it is because they become convicted of their misdeeds, there will be no guarantee that they will have a large enough private room available in the prison while they serve their sentence. Yes ‚Äì you heard right! Human rights therefore protect these people from prosecution in their own country. An EU country. Because the room in the prison - AFTER they have been sentenced, if applicable - is not considered to be large enough. That is grotesque. And I must strongly urge the government to step up and get that matter resolved .These Romanians MUST be deported by Denmark. They have absolutely NOTHING to do in this country. And quite frankly. If they have done what they are accused of, I don't care how much private space they subsequently have in a Romanian prison! These people should not be a burden to Danish taxpayers. These people should be sent home. ‚Äî‚Äî It seems completely wrong that we should have free movement of citizens from countries to which we cannot deport them when they are accused of serious crime. It doesn't work! It is also examples like these that have caused the British to say stop. To want to opt out of the EU. The anger at an EU summit that does not hear the signals from the people. There is far from an English working in north-west England, who has lost his job to an Eastern European, and then to the EU Commission in the palace in Brussels. But Brexit should be an eye-opener. Should make all the alarm bells ring. Make the EU change its saddle decisively. But no On the contrary. In the EU, there is serious talk now that the pace can be increased - now that the stubborn British are on their way out. And the arrogance continues to shine from the top of the EU. For example, Jean-Claude Juncker. Chairman of the EU Commission. He said with great joy in the voice after Brexit: ""Slowly but surely English is losing its importance in Europe."" That probably around 1 billion people in the world speak English. That it is the common language when people meet across national borders - also in Europe Also in the European Parliament. And in the EU in general. It was passed over. The desire to say something negative about the recalcitrant British was so great that such nonsense came out of his mouth.‚Äî‚Äî- At the same time, EU Commission President Juncker has sought to undermine support for British Prime Minister Theresa May here before the election on Thursday by leaking from a confidential dinner conversation.

It was an attempt to undermine the most central person, which is otherwise expected to negotiate Brexit on behalf of Great Britain. But it was a distasteful way of doing it. I think we should make a clear call to the non-elected EU commissioners: Get involved outside of the British election Thursday. The British do it best themselves. Concentrate on how you get out of your own distant galaxy so that you can better serve the populations of Europe you were put in the world to serve. ‚Äî‚Äî- Speaking of the British .On Brexit. What is the Danish interest? What should Denmark fight for here? We must ensure continued free trade with the British. We have many companies that have great interests in Great Britain.

But there are politicians in Christiansborg who do not listen to us, but would rather listen to so-called experts. But these politicians can now read in black and white partly the Ministry of Finance's calculation of the costs for primarily the people who have come to Denmark via the asylum system and the family reunification system - partly the Rockwall Foundation's analysis that austerity measures work in relation to how many come here. That is why there is a difference in how many come when the Danish People's Party has influence and when we don't. That there is a difference in how many come when the radicals, the Alternative and Enhedslisten have influence and when they don't. And let me make it absolutely clear: As a country, we cannot tolerate that there will be new 4-year periods in which the Danish People's Party is excluded from influence. Where again an increasing number will come to Denmark primarily from the Middle East and North Africa. That is why we must also have wrested the Social Democracy out of the clutches of the radicals, the alternative and the unity list. And the Social Democracy must guarantee the Danes that, regardless of the political price, these three parties will never again have an influence on Danish immigration policy! We simply must have ensured that the immigration policy is ALWAYS made in the future with us. Only in this way can we ensure that we hand over a decent Denmark to future generations!‚Äî‚Äî There is a lot to do. And we know very well that it takes time. There are simply too grotesque examples of a wrong policy. That the courts considered that Levakovic could not be extradited from Denmark because of his human rights was grotesque. It is also grotesque that the Supreme Court reached the conclusion last week that 4 Romanians could not be repatriated for a trial on human trafficking. These 4 EU citizens from the EU country Romania is considered to be involved in a huge case of human trafficking. They should have exploited some of the most vulnerable in the most despicable way. But when the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that they cannot be deported, it is because they become convicted of their misdeeds, there will be no guarantee that they will have a large enough private room available in the prison while they serve their sentence. Yes ‚Äì you heard right! Human rights therefore protect these people from prosecution in their own country. An EU country. Because the room in the prison - AFTER they have been sentenced, if applicable - is not considered to be large enough. That is grotesque. And I must strongly urge the government to step up and get that matter resolved .These Romanians MUST be deported by Denmark. They have absolutely NOTHING to do in this country. And quite frankly. If they have done what they are accused of, I don't care how much private space they subsequently have in a Romanian prison! These people should not be a burden to Danish taxpayers. These people should be sent home. ‚Äî‚Äî It seems completely wrong that we should have free movement of citizens from countries to which we cannot deport them when they are accused of serious crime. It doesn't work! It is also examples like these that have caused the British to say stop. To want to opt out of the EU. The anger at an EU summit that does not hear the signals from the people. There is far from an English working in north-west England, who has lost his job to an Eastern European, and then to the EU Commission in the palace in Brussels. But Brexit should be an eye-opener. Should make all the alarm bells ring. Make the EU change its saddle decisively. But no On the contrary. In the EU, there is serious talk now that the pace can be increased - now that the stubborn British are on their way out. And the arrogance continues to shine from the top of the EU. For example, Jean-Claude Juncker. Chairman of the EU Commission. He said with great joy in the voice after Brexit: ""Slowly but surely English is losing its importance in Europe."" That probably around 1 billion people in the world speak English. That it is the common language when people meet across national borders - also in Europe Also in the European Parliament. And in the EU in general. It was passed over. The desire to say something negative about the recalcitrant British was so great that such nonsense came out of his mouth.‚Äî‚Äî- At the same time, EU Commission President Juncker has sought to undermine support for British Prime Minister Theresa May here before the election on Thursday by leaking from a confidential dinner conversation. After the dinner, Juncker and his people had leaked that he considered Theresa May a woman ""who lives in a distant galaxy"". It was an attempt to undermine the most central person, which is otherwise expected to negotiate Brexit on behalf of Great Britain. But it was a distasteful way of doing it. I think we should make a clear call to the non-elected EU commissioners: Get involved outside of the British election Thursday. The British do it best themselves. Concentrate on how you get out of your own distant galaxy so that you can better serve the populations of Europe you were put in the world to serve. ‚Äî‚Äî- Speaking of the British .On Brexit. What is the Danish interest? What should Denmark fight for here? We must ensure continued free trade with the British. We have many companies that have great interests in Great Britain. For example, our entire agricultural sector actually has very great interests in being able to sell to Great Britain. That is why we must ask the question: What is more important to us? Free trade or free movement of EU citizens. The answer is screamingly simple! It is free trade! Yet the EU has decided that there should only be free trade if the British at the same time accept free immigration from, among other things, Eastern Europe. That is the really big problem. This linking of free trade and free immigration. The EU summit already decided 6 days after the British vote on 23 June last year to stand firm on this interconnection. And it is this that has led the British to go for a so-called ""hard Brexit"", where they then opt out of the single market as well. But from here the message is clear: Denmark should change course. Denmark should announce the other EU countries that we want to remove this linkage. That we want maximum free trade with our British friends - and that we do not link this with a demand for free movement of Eastern Europeans among others. Because of course the British themselves have to decide on their own border and who they want into their country. That is every country's right, by the way.‚Äî‚Äî- Brexit must not be used to turbocharge the EU towards ""an ever narrower union"", as the treaty otherwise states. It will bring the EU even further away from the people. Even a super-European and federalist supporter like Professor Uffe √òstergaard has seen the writing on the wall. In Berlingske at the beginning of May, one could read: ""It has been a big problem for the EU that the EU have spoken as if you were a state without being one. And there I have great respect for the voters. They can obviously see through the false tone when the government leaders come out and say they have a plan that everyone can hear is pure wishful thinking. Uffe √òstergaard describes it as a ""shock"" for optimists like himself, when they realized how big the differences between societies in Western and Eastern Europe really are. He points out, for example, that the minimum wage in Bulgaria is lower than the child benefit in Denmark. He says in the article, ""In particular, the free movement of labor turned out to be a revolutionary principle. Originally it was thought that it would concern men aged 20-40, but then it also included women, who became families, who became unemployed , which led to illegal immigrants gaining social rights. There is an overall clash between the populations, which have become more national.‚Äù If the EU leaders don't want to listen to us, can they not listen to someone like Uffe √òstergaard? An ardent supporter of the EU. A man who has understood that the current development is completely unsustainable! So from here it should read: Thank you, Uffe √òstergaard .Thank you for finally taking the leaf out of your mouth.‚Äî‚Äî- We must stick together in our country. In Denmark. I began with considerations about the word ""hygge"". Hygge in Danish. Like here at Lykkesholm Castle today. Like in those nursing homes around the country, where from now on the smell of delicious food will be wanted, while the table is covered with a tablecloth and candles. Like when I visited a nursing home in Aalborg recently and my sidekick at the lunch table answered Nordjutske's journalist's question about why it was now so important with all this around food. And the good nursing home resident replied: Yes ‚Äì because when it's nice, then a mouthful more smoke goes down. That answer said it all!‚Äî‚Äì Or the coziness at the police station, when we've been trained so many more officers that at the station after a long shift they have time to sit down with a lemon moon and a cup of coffee and give each other a smile. Before they go out again to ensure the safety of all of us. And the German tourist on his way over the border to Denmark, heading towards the summer house on the west coast, meets the friendly border guard, who nods and welcomes to a Denmark that offers security in a world unfortunately full of the opposite. And when we ensure that the hospital staff have time to also provide care and presence for those of our fellow citizens who fall ill and have to be treated in a hospital. And have the small surplus in everyday life that is needed to create a little ""joy"" - the little smile - even in a situation, even in that situation where you are otherwise uneasy about what lies ahead.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì It requires a long, tough move to secure the Denmark we care about. There are forces both within and outside the country's borders that want to destroy the Denmark we know. And we have just seen it again in London. A few weeks ago we saw it in Manchester. Before that, Stockholm, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Brussels. For many, it is the beginning of daily life. There is dismay, yes of course. There is distancing .But at the same time: Well, where was it this time? It creeps into our lives. We live on. Not as if nothing has happened. But still, in a strange way, a bit as if... Maybe that's the really scary thing. It was reported from the English embassy in Copenhagen yesterday that there were not that many flowers. There were a few more after the terror in Manchester. Many more after the previous terrorist attacks. Politicians and opinion leaders distance themselves from terror. Of course. At the same time it means that we have to live on as we usually do. Otherwise the terrorists will have won, it is said. And of course there is something to be said. But what is decisive for people in general to be able to live on as they usually do is that we politicians make the decisions that in the future can help ensure our security. It is typically fanatical Islamists who threaten our security. Some of them come as travelers to our countries. But we have seen that the terrorists often come from the parallel societies , which has unfortunately arisen in the Western countries. Areas where it is difficult to rediscover Western culture and our values. Areas where Middle Eastern medieval customs are allowed to be decisive. We saw it ourselves in the documentary program TV2 broadcast a year ago since ""Mosques behind the veil"". Such a broadcast could undoubtedly be made again today. It is a huge problem. These people are so inspired by people abroad. Both by the Islamic State's call for death and destruction on the so-called ""infidels"". But also by travelers. We must have fought that evil. Both where the Islamic State has tried to gain a foothold, in Syria and Iraq, where our soldiers are making a huge effort. But also by making it more difficult for these people to travel around. And we do that, among other things, with border control. And then we must have fought the parallel societies. We do that, among other things, by the fact that for decades there will be very few new migrants. At the same time that we tighten the course towards those who already are here. Criminals must be deported. People who, for example, preach death to Jews must be stopped. They must not be allowed to incite new terrorist attacks against innocents. Innocents such as the children and young people who in Manchester never came out to their waiting parents after the concert. The young people who became victims of the terror. There is enough to be done. There is enough to be done to secure our society. Our way of life. So it just doesn't come by itself. The generations before us have built a fantastically nice country to live in. This little spot on mother earth. We must not accept that this place will be destroyed in a few decades. The Constitution that we celebrate today is a good foundation for our nation. A good foundation for our country ‚Äì for our Commonwealth. But the Constitution also only provides the foundation. It is what is built on top of it in everyday life that determines our future. Whether there is also to be fun in Denmark in the future. As I have discussed, things can progress, if not we in the Danish People's Party have the decisive influence on the development of our country. That is why you are important! Because you are our ambassadors. You carry the message around the country. You have a large part of the credit for the fact that the Danish People's Party today is to be avoided. A party that the others are forced to listen to. Let's celebrate it today. Together with the birthday of the Constitution. A good birthday for a proud nation, where we together secure the future of that country, which we love so much. Will you get up and together with me live a threefold life for the Constitution and for our lovely country, which we will fight for is also a pleasant place to be in the future.

54329.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech to DF's annual meeting 2017. The spoken word applies. Currently we can see an advertisement with Mads Mikkelsen cycling through Copenhagen. The advertisement is about why we in Denmark are one of the happiest people in the world. Why are we? Mads Mikkelsen cycling through the streets - over a well-laid table with happy people to end up in Valby. Inside the old brewer Jacobsen's brewery. The advertisement ends by stating that the happiness of the Danes could also be about a single important thing: Beer! Carlsberg. The best beer in the world! Probably. This advertisement is just one example of Denmark selling! Selling well! We can do it! We're happy! yes, almost wherever you turn, it's about all the good things Denmark can achievers. So we are simply one of the best countries in the world. In the American presidential election campaign we were highlighted. Everyone is looking to see if there is something they can learn from ‚Äì copy. Lots of people want to come here. even if it is for minimum wages. Whether it is other Europeans who want to study at our educational institutions. People from the Middle East and Africa who want to come here and share in our welfare. They all look at Denmark and think; if only we could live in such a country - then all problems would be solved! We - that is, primarily the generations before us - have created a fantastic country. We should be proud of that. Happy for it. But every responsible politician must keep quiet themselves the question: How can we ensure that we can say the same in 20 years. In 50 years. In 100 years? That Denmark is the best country in the world. How can we hand over what we have received to future generations with pride and say; we have managed our heritage well - and we can now pass it on to you in at least the same condition as when we received it. What does it take? About a year ago, Jyllands-Posten had a rather interesting manager. Ok - it has they also had since. But this particular one is worth sticking with. I have saved it. The leader quotes the American commentator and journalist Christopher Caldwell, who in a book from 2009 asked the simple, but according to Jyllands-Posten absolutely central question: Can Europe will remain the Europe we know, with a different population than the current one. Culturally, politically and economically? Caldwell's answer was ""hardly"". The leader goes on to explain that Europe should be aware of the reasons for the continent's success in the half century after The Second World War. In order to ensure peace, after the First and Second World Wars, the Europeans set about building homogeneous nation-states, so that the cause of civil war and discord in the past was minimized. Therefore - the leader continues - it is perfectly legitimate and in accordance with expensively bought experience , if the European societies want to maintain a certain homogeneity. Diversity is not a value in itself.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì Homogeneity! Isn't this precisely the prerequisite for a country to stick together? Cohesion. Feeling of true community. It is in every that's what former professor ‚Äì even Jean Monnet professor ‚Äì Uffe √òstergaard has come to after many years. Uffe √òstergaard has previously been a sharp opponent for us. Was close to former Venstre chairman Uffe Ellemann's EU socks. So you know like, what type we are dealing with... But he has come up with other ideas. And good for that! Now he says this: ""I thought for many years that the cohesion of our society could easily hold up to immigration. But I have recognized, that our social model is more fragile than I thought. We must not be so modest. It is not enough that the people who come to Denmark with a different culture and religion than ours comply with the country's laws. They must stand up for our society, and they must assimilate, otherwise we cannot maintain cohesion. We must dare to say that we demand assimilation."" And he continues: ""It is our triumph that we are so homogeneous, and we must protect that. We have not paid attention to this historical difference here at home."" When the media and leading figures in this way realize that the previously significant immigration to Denmark has undermined our country, we can of course raise our eyebrows and say; what did we say! But instead of hovering, I would much rather embrace. I am glad that there are more and more behind the basic analysis of Denmark's challenges, which we have always had in the Danish People's Party. Because if we put ourselves the question: Why are we here? Why is DF necessary? Is it not precisely to ensure a greater understanding of what makes Denmark a unique country? Is it not precisely to ensure greater support for Denmark as a safe environment for future generations too? And when more and more people - including people who previously believed in multiculturalism and multireligiousness - now realize that they were wrong, we should not welcome them to a common fight for the country that we care so much about. at 10 minutes past 12. A lot has gone wrong. But we can still save our country. But it requires determination. Purpose. Consistency. We have it! Welcome to the 2017 annual meeting here in Herning! We are gathered again in these lovely, warm surroundings .Here in Herning Midtby.Where over a few days we will enjoy each other's company.Have many political discussions - but also have time to party.We have a reputation for having the best party among the parties - shall we not show tonight, that it fits? I'm already looking forward to it!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- In June I was in the beautiful Haderslev Cathedral, where we marked the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. A completely decisive milestone in our history. In many ways a foundation for that society , we know today. The Reformation actually paved the way for us today to have a so-called secular society. Where we can rest in our religion. Know our point of view. But don't use the priest in church on Sunday to tell us how we on Tuesday will vote in the Folketing. It actually works very well! But Islam stands against this as a religion of law. Which is hardly compatible with a society like ours. Where a so-called ""absolute truth"" is defined to a much greater extent. I think that is a little over a month ago, one day I was driving in a car - and heard on the radio - a professor talking about a large study that had been carried out in a number of countries. They had asked different populations if they believed that there is a absolute truth. The results were telling. In Pakistan - which you know is a strictly Islamic country - 95 percent answered YES! There is an absolute truth. In Turkey, just outside the border with the EU, 85 percent answered yes. In Great Britain the figure was down to 45 per cent. And here in Denmark? Well... Five per cent. I think that is telling in many ways. We have a healthy skepticism here at home. The Danes - we have progressed! Not least because of this, the combination of a secular western people's government like ours and Islam so difficult. An almost insurmountable problem. But we deal with problems. Or challenges as we call them. Even if they seem terribly big. We have suggestions for solutions - I will come back to them.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Since we met a year ago, quite a lot has happened. The narrow Liberal government has become the VLAK government. Ultimate demands for top tax reductions have been replaced by seats in ministerial cars. The Danish People's Party has gained an even greater role. We can now alone majority with the government. But we can also in many situations choose to create a majority outside the government when we find it necessary. Having more paths to take gives greater influence. Therefore, in the situation last year, it was good that the Liberals expanded the government with LA and K. It certainly hasn't made life harder for us. But it hasn't made life harder for us either, that the Social Democratic Party with Mette Frederiksen at the helm has chosen to replace previous hate campaigns against DF with an outstretched hand for cooperation. That hand we have accepted. And since the Social Democratic Party is holding a congress in Aalborg at the same time as our annual meeting here in Herning, I think we should send a greeting north. With the hope that the Social Democratic Party's hinterland will support their party leadership's change of course regarding immigration policy and thus cooperate with us. I read at one point that the party had given Henrik Sass Larsen a ""roaring ban"". But quite frankly: Dear Social Democrats. If you want to show that you have taken the full step, then let Henrik Sass roar at the top of his lungs blow out! And then one more thing... Because there is one more party that is holding a national meeting this weekend. The wing party The Radical Left. This party stands together with Alternativet and Enhedslisten for everything that the previously mentioned Uffe √òstergaard has abandoned. About the multi-cultural, the multi-religious. In reality, about everything that breaks down the community and the cohesion that we care about in our country. If I could get Aladdin's lamp - if I could get the spirit of the lamp out and grant me one wish. Yes - then it would be that the Social Democrats guarantee this weekend from Aalborg that the radicals in Nyborg will have absolutely no influence on immigration policy in the future. Guarantees that regardless of whether the so-called red bloc wins a forthcoming general election, the radicals, Alternativet, Enhedslisten will have no influence on immigration policy. Because just as I do not think that the last mandate of the Liberal Alliance should dictate tax policy, I also do not think that it the last mandate of the radicals or of the Alternative must dictate the immigration policy. On the contrary, I think that the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Danish People's Party across the blocs must guarantee the Danes that from now on immigration will be kept under control. That we will not let it go wrong again. That it is now the border guards who have taken power - and that the border guards have been given time off. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- We are busy. There are a lot of things we have to manage! We have, among other things, witnessed completely absurd situations in Copenhagen in particular. Innocents have been shot. Hard-boiled criminals have completely disregarded all Danish rules and norms. The police have had to advise young people to stay indoors to avoid being hit. The gangs have been wreaking havoc. One of these gangs is the so-called Loyal to Familia. The leader is Pakistani. His name is Shuaib Khan. He is not a Danish citizen - and he has been in prison several times. Among other things for fatal violence against a man in Jomfru Ane Gade in Aalborg. The 21-year-old man received 14 deep stab wounds, as well as being kicked and beaten with broken bottles, chairs and fists. He died from it. Shuaib Khan, together with a group of others, received a sentence for the death penalty, Shuaib Khan was released on parole after only four years. He has not been deported from Denmark! What do you think we should put up with such a man? Don't you just think that he should be thrown out of our country? I mean it! Next, we must have closed the gangs that cause violence and insecurity. Loyal to familia, Brothas, Black Army and whatever else they are all called. Their only purpose is violence, drug dealing, extortion and everything else that we cannot or must accept here in Denmark. That it has also just come to light that 63 percent of the gang members who per.1. May 2017 was registered in the police's special gang register, received cash assistance during 2016, alongside their crime, is absolutely wrong. But don't we have our good, old constitution to stop such things! You would think so. Section 78 of the Basic Law says precisely that associations that work through violence can be banned. Then we wouldn't see to start. No more words about iron fists and zero tolerance. Shut down those gangs! They have done that in several places in Germany. With good results as a result. This must also happen here in Denmark! And then the gangs have to take the case to the courts afterwards if they want to try to get the ban lifted again. But a ban gives the police more powers to stop the gangs' rampage. And our task is to ensure the security of the Danes. So it's just a matter of getting started. We must have created a state of law where it is possible to send criminals like Levakovic and Shuaib Khan out of Denmark. We must decide for ourselves how many and which migrants we want to enter our country. We must make sure that potential terrorists are denied citizenship in Denmark. Exactly these examples show areas where there is still a majority in the Folketing to put the conventions above common sense. One has to ask himself: Have the conventions kept up with the times? Or do the conventions ‚Äì as they are interpreted today ‚Äì prevent common sense from taking place. The answer is self-evident... The conventions are precisely to blame for the fact that Levakovic, who has 28 convictions behind him and who also has never contributed positively to Danish society, has not smoked on a plane home to Croatia for a long time. We can thank the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights for that. The same convention that protects Shuaib Khan from smoking home to Pakistan. in that a Syrian refugee could have the family reunification of his ‚Äì hold on tight ‚Äì 17 children, whom he has with three different wives. The interpretation of conventions was also the reason why a majority in the Danish Parliament in 2014 granted citizenship to a foreigner, even though the person concerned The police's intelligence service was assessed to be a danger to Denmark's security. As recently as this summer, the Supreme Court assessed that the European Convention on Human Rights prevented a group of Romanians from being sent home for prosecution in a case of serious human trafficking. The Supreme Court assessed , that if they were found guilty - GUILTY - they would have a room in prison that would be too small in relation to their human rights. Therefore, these people may not now be held accountable for their deeds in Romania. But we hang on them here in Denmark. Completely absurd! I am getting tired of the fact that criminal foreigners can seek shelter behind international conventions. That simply cannot have been the intention of the conventions. That is why we must keep the government on its promise to seek the conventions changed. But also make it clear that if this cannot be done, then Denmark must be prepared to challenge the conventions - and if that is not enough, then make reservations for the parts of the conventions that prevent us from expelling criminal aliens of the country. We no longer want to be laughed at for our own money.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The people we allow into our country must want to be a positive contribution to Denmark. People we would like to see come. People who come with an honest heart to contribute - not to undermine our country. Such people - whether it is to work or as tourists, must be warmly welcomed. And don't the populations of most countries think like that? I think so! But to ensure that, of course, you have to have control at your borders. At the front door. Control at a country's borders is natural. It is Schengen's borderless Europe that is unnatural .I really find it difficult to understand why it should be a discussion whether to guard one's border or not. Regardless of whether one day the EU should succeed in getting control of the EU's external borders - and I doubt that it ever will happen - then we want to take the view that Denmark must guard its border. Friendly, but firm. Open to the good guests, closed to those we don't want in. So therefore to the rest of the Parliament: Don't leave it to a Greek EU Commissioner to decide whether Denmark must have border control. Let's state that border control is here to stay. Now let's get that border control expanded and made permanent!_ One of our slogans is: There is so much we have to watch out! I think that fits so well with what it's all about. We have so much we want to watch out for. And there are so many dangers out there that we have to watch out for! What do you think if I mention‚Ä¶ Paris Copenhagen Brussels Nice Berlin Stockholm Manchester Barcelona London Yes ‚Äì You have probably guessed it. Cities in Europe where Islamic terrorists have committed terrorist attacks. We have a hard time dealing with how to react when once again are told that terrorists have mowed down a crowd with a truck, or stabbed innocent bystanders with knives, or as we saw yesterday, tried to detonate a bomb on the London Underground. We HAVE to open our eyes to this one new world and the enemy who wants us to die. We must recognize that many of the terrorists are people who grew up in the countries themselves. Perhaps they got inspiration from outside but also got a hatred for the country they grew up in, which can cause them to commit terrorism. Therefore we will have to ask: What do Muslim children learn at the Muslim free schools? against the infidels? When it is necessary to have a quarter of the Muslim free schools under strict supervision. Should our free mind accommodate such schools? Or is it too naive to let it stand. I mean the latter! Or when we hear about mosques that invite preachers of hate on the pulpits who call for violence, killing and stoning. Where you do not want to distance yourself from Islamic State - where you pay tribute to terrorists, as we have seen in, for example, the Grimh√∏j Mosque in Aarhus. No. We must not be naive. Take the money away them. Stress them so that it is difficult for them to recruit more fanatics. It is completely crazy that we spend taxpayers' money on schools that teach jihad and on mosques that preach hate right here in the middle of our own Denmark. We must speak up. We have to say stop. And for those who don't like the smell in the bakery here - then go to your like-minded people in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East. But don't destroy our young people with your twisted medieval nonsense.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî - One of the really big political issues in these years is called Brexit. On 23 June 2016, the British voted for continued membership of the EU. There was a majority in favor of ""Leave"" - ‚Äã‚Äãto make Britain independent again. Great Britain is an important ally for Denmark. Our soldiers are some of those who work most closely together in international missions. The British and the Danes have been close for generations. It was British Field Marshal Montgomery who issued the legendary announcement that the German troops in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark had surrendered. Who doesn't remember that particular scene from Matador? The one where bank director Varn√¶s surprises the fine company by tearing down the hated blackout curtains after they have heard the wonderful news over the radio from England? Fantastic. The British are our friends. The British are our allies. The British are our close trading partners. They should be in the future as well. But the next few years will be decisive in terms of how the close bond can be maintained. The question the British asked themselves in their referendum on 23 June 2016, was basically whether they saw the EU as part of the solution or as part of the problem. The answer was that the EU was mostly part of the problem. I understand the British answer. The EU has, for example, asked the member states to remove their border controls under the pretext that the so-called external borders were under control. But the truth is that the external borders will never be controlled. When you saw the outcry when Hungary actually wanted to enforce its border, you know that the political will is not present. The EU has adopted a forced distribution of up to 120,000 migrants. Although Hungary and Slovenia have tried to have the decision overturned at the European Court of Justice, it has been established that the EU has the right to require migrants to be forcibly distributed to certain countries in the EU. After this judgment, haven't many Danes been confirmed that it is good that we have the reservation of rights? It is precisely this reservation that means that the EU cannot force these migrants to Denmark! But the thinking itself in this forced placement is absurd. And of course undermines the countries' sovereignty quite violently. And then the German Chancellor Merkel showed in autumn 2015 that in the EU it is the right of the strongest. When Germany wants, our common rules are irrelevant. Because then Merkel agreed that 1 million people could migrate up through Europe, which at this time was without internal border controls, she looked big on the common rules, which is otherwise the main argument that the EU is especially good for small countries. With these examples - and many more could be mentioned - it is completely understandable that the UK has had enough. Now it is about how to make a good agreement between the EU and the UK. A good agreement is an agreement where both parties stand as winners .Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Brussels for the British to come out badly. That there must be a penalty in opting out of the EU. This is completely unsympathetic. Perhaps for Brussels it is also about being afraid of , that a good agreement ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãalso for the British ‚Äì will make others (Denmark) see possibilities for a new association with the EU? members to by using fear and threats about all the terrible things that will happen if you don't want to join in. The EU must not look like one of the rock gangs that ravage our streets in that respect. So we will insist that work is being done loyally and dutifully to make a good agreement for the British and for the EU - including Denmark. And what is a good agreement? The most important thing is free trade. That our companies can sell goods as freely as possible in the other countries. Denmark has a colossal interest in having free market access ‚Äì also to Great Britain. Just think of our entire food cluster. It is an old truth that if you want the best Danish bacon, you have to go to England. set it aside. But why is free trade between Denmark and Great Britain threatened? Between the EU and Great Britain threatened? Simply for one reason only: Namely that the EU has set as a requirement for free trade that Great Britain accepts continued free immigration from, for example, the Eastern European countries. is a hoot! When you have followed the British debate, you know that this is exactly where the British must regain full control. On the issue of immigration! The British are simply so tired of being able to move around in large parts of, among other things, London and having endless difficulty finding a Brit. I was in London the day former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died. There were extra editions of the newspapers, which were distributed around that afternoon. TV broadcast extras. It was really big. But most of the people I met on my way were Eastern Europeans. So when I asked what they thought about the death, which was all over the front of the newspapers, everywhere on TV, they replied that they had never heard of it the lady. They simply didn't know who she was and many of them were also numbingly indifferent. That doesn't make them bad people. But it destroys the cohesion of a country when there is no shared history. Shared memory. So the British want control immigration. And I ask: Is it in our interest ‚Äì is it in Denmark's interest that the British are kept as much as possible in the internal market with free trade ‚Äì and in return get full rights to control immigration to their country? The answer is quite simple. Of course it is! But is that the position of the Danish government in the EU? No. And exactly here I would like to make a request to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. Make it clear to the other countries in the EU that we want a new negotiating line from the EU's side. That we want the EU to tell the British that if they stay in our free trade area, they will of course decide on immigration themselves. This is the only logical thing! Because why should the condition that you can trade with each other at the same time be that Roma can travel freely to beg and create insecurity. Or that you are obliged to send child benefits to children in Romania and Poland. Children who may never have set foot in the country that has to pay the bill. Why do we have to put up with migrant workers undermining the conditions on our labor market. Why do we have to put up with wage suppression and worse working conditions - in order to be able to trade with each other? Of course we don't have to either. The EU's rules have distanced themselves from common sense .It must be changed. And let's use the Brexit negotiations to ensure just that!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì By the way, it is worrying to watch the coverage of Brexit in the media. Great Britain is a democracy. They have had a referendum. Their politicians then discusses what is wise for them to do. Is it healthy? Yes ‚Äì one would think so. But when it is transmitted back home to Denmark by DR and TV2 and the written press, it always turns out that in Great Britain is chaos. That they don't know what they want. That there is political arm-twisting that is tearing the country apart. Negative negative negative. And all stories are turned around so that it seems like doomsday. If a survey shows that 30-35 percent are considering leaving the UK over the coming years, it will be people fleeing because of Brexit. Nevermind that 65-70 percent won't. Or an assessment that there are people coming and going all the time, why the number may be close to what it usually is. And their economy is in tatters, we must understand! If it is an expression of the press that is also in Great Britain, it is particularly interesting that many measurements show that the majority for Brexit is intact. Conversely with the media's coverage of the EU's negotiating position. References are made as if it were the EU's own press department that briefed. And usually we are simply told that such and such is the EU's position. No critical questions about why. Or whether the EU's position is reasonable! The completely deadlocked connection of the question of whether one must accept free immigration in order to be part of the free trade area was, for example, established in the EU at a meeting just a few days after the British referendum in June 2016. that's in place! But no journalists in the major national media have asked critical questions about it. It's just been interpreted as a fact. So the highly critical journalism is wild and bloody when it comes to the coverage in London. But it disappears completely in the mists when it comes to Brussels. This is not just sad. It is harmful to our democracy. So, dear journalists. Can we make an agreement? Before the next annual meeting, you must promise to ask just one critical question to Brussels, for every time you doing 5 critical features from London. Think - could we just get there... ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- It has become autumn in Denmark. And autumn has obviously become synonymous with discussions about tax. Now it is at least the second year in a row, that we must put our hands on the tax policy. The course is chalked up. The government has played out with big plans. Both in relation to tax, business and financial law. The coming two months will show what a majority can be made for. And let me just hit fixed: In DF, we have nothing against the Danes keeping more of their money in their own pockets. But we have two crucial prerequisites for this to be possible. The first is that there is sufficient money in our common coffers to the challenges we have ahead of us. The second is that there is a reasonableness between top and bottom. We lack hands in our elderly care. In the future, there will be more elderly people. Also more elderly people who manage themselves. It is absolutely only positive. But there are also more elderly people - including those with dementia who need help and care. Only people with their hearts in the right place can provide it. And that requires resources. So we know that we must prioritize the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly more than we do today. No one should tremble at the thought of a care home where you have to spend the night on the floor if you have fallen out of bed. Or fear sitting forgotten on the toilet for hours or not having a shower, as you have otherwise been used to. We must ensure dignity for our elderly. Our healthcare system runs on the pumps in many places. In Denmark, we have thousands of super-skilled doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and all the other groups we have on our hospitals, doctors' offices, etc. But for many years we have also demanded that they run stronger. For over 15 years we have had a so-called productivity requirement - in the past many years of 2 percent per year. The hospitals have delivered. Thank you for that .This has meant, among other things, that we do not talk about waiting lists at all today, as we did years ago. But we now say clearly that time has run out from the rigid demand for increased productivity, as it has been formulated. It is working our staff down. It's no longer the right way to do it. That's why we want it gone! And the sooner the better. There are plenty of people in the health care system who have been shouting guard for a long time. The most recent was a professor and senior physician Liselotte H√∏jgaard, head of clinic at Rigshospitalet. In a new debate book, she makes a harsh criticism of the conditions in the healthcare system. ""The system is chronically ill and lies in a bed in intensive care because someone is standing on the oxygen tube,"" she says. We needs committed employees in the healthcare system. And therefore we must take the concerns of the healthcare staff seriously and show them that we are both listening and acting. In the same way, we have a police force that is pushed to the limit. More and more tasks - but not more officers. The resources have been prioritized for people at the desks, but to that extent there is also a need for skilled visible police officers on the streets throughout the country. We saw the need early on. Actually went to the polls in 2015 on a plan for a net 2,000 more officers over the following 10 years. And it is going the right way with training more officers, but it takes time. Most recently, we have trained first team of police cadets, who must relieve the police, e.g. at the border. Unfortunately, a dispute over their terms of employment has meant that they are not functioning yet. A strong call from here to get this resolved quickly. Decisive for many of the right good people, we have in care for the elderly, in the hospitals, the police don't know whether they think it's too busy right now. It's whether there is a perspective of better conditions. More resources. Whether people really listen from the political side .But if there is no money left, when tax cuts have been given, the hope for better conditions disappears. Then the solid - capable - people will lose courage. Then they will find other places to work. And then we will find it even more difficult to deliver a proper welfare society. That must not happen. That is why there must be money in the coffers to strengthen our welfare society when the autumn agreements have been concluded.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì And when we talk about taxes. Then we also talk about top and bottom. About people who earn a lot of money and people with low incomes. The government got off a bit wrong with the director and the HK on minimum wage. They based the calculations on the fact that a director and a HK had the same expenditure on housing. And what was their plan for greatest benefit for the HK. I wonder if we have become wiser there? But that followed on the heels of a statement from Anders Samuelsen that the government had now dropped top tax relief. Because people in the government had read that it was probably not right what we thought was highest on the list of wishes. But when the proposal came, it was with a proposal to remove the so-called ceiling on the employment deduction. It may sound a bit dry. But whoa: Doesn't it have exactly the same effect as reducing The top tax? Yes. The proposal means that a very large proportion of the tax relief will be given to precisely those who earn the most. And the higher the income ‚Äì the higher the relief. One must quietly ask our friends in the government: Don't you think your policy will be discovered?

54329.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech to DF's annual meeting 2017. The spoken word applies. Currently we can see an advertisement with Mads Mikkelsen cycling through Copenhagen. The advertisement is about why we in Denmark are one of the happiest people in the world. Why are we? Mads Mikkelsen cycling through the streets - over a well-laid table with happy people to end up in Valby. Inside the old brewer Jacobsen's brewery. The advertisement ends by stating that the happiness of the Danes could also be about a single important thing: Beer! Carlsberg. The best beer in the world! Probably. This advertisement is just one example of Denmark selling! Selling well! We can do it! We're happy! yes, almost wherever you turn, it's about all the good things Denmark can achievers. So we are simply one of the best countries in the world. In the American presidential election campaign we were highlighted. Everyone is looking to see if there is something they can learn from ‚Äì copy. Lots of people want to come here. even if it is for minimum wages. Whether it is other Europeans who want to study at our educational institutions. People from the Middle East and Africa who want to come here and share in our welfare. They all look at Denmark and think; if only we could live in such a country - then all problems would be solved! We - that is, primarily the generations before us - have created a fantastic country. We should be proud of that. Happy for it. But every responsible politician must keep quiet themselves the question: How can we ensure that we can say the same in 20 years. In 50 years. In 100 years? That Denmark is the best country in the world. How can we hand over what we have received to future generations with pride and say; we have managed our heritage well - and we can now pass it on to you in at least the same condition as when we received it. What does it take? About a year ago, Jyllands-Posten had a rather interesting manager. Ok - it has they also had since. But this particular one is worth sticking with. I have saved it. The leader quotes the American commentator and journalist Christopher Caldwell, who in a book from 2009 asked the simple, but according to Jyllands-Posten absolutely central question: Can Europe will remain the Europe we know, with a different population than the current one. Culturally, politically and economically? Caldwell's answer was ""hardly"". The leader goes on to explain that Europe should be aware of the reasons for the continent's success in the half century after The Second World War. In order to ensure peace, after the First and Second World Wars, the Europeans set about building homogeneous nation-states, so that the cause of civil war and discord in the past was minimized. Therefore - the leader continues - it is perfectly legitimate and in accordance with expensively bought experience , if the European societies want to maintain a certain homogeneity. Diversity is not a value in itself.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì Homogeneity! Isn't this precisely the prerequisite for a country to stick together? Cohesion. Feeling of true community. It is in every that's what former professor ‚Äì even Jean Monnet professor ‚Äì Uffe √òstergaard has come to after many years. Uffe √òstergaard has previously been a sharp opponent for us. Was close to former Venstre chairman Uffe Ellemann's EU socks. So you know like, what type we are dealing with... But he has come up with other ideas. And good for that! Now he says this: ""I thought for many years that the cohesion of our society could easily hold up to immigration. But I have recognized, that our social model is more fragile than I thought. We must not be so modest. It is not enough that the people who come to Denmark with a different culture and religion than ours comply with the country's laws. They must stand up for our society, and they must assimilate, otherwise we cannot maintain cohesion. We must dare to say that we demand assimilation."" And he continues: ""It is our triumph that we are so homogeneous, and we must protect that. We have not paid attention to this historical difference here at home."" When the media and leading figures in this way realize that the previously significant immigration to Denmark has undermined our country, we can of course raise our eyebrows and say; what did we say! But instead of hovering, I would much rather embrace. I am glad that there are more and more behind the basic analysis of Denmark's challenges, which we have always had in the Danish People's Party. Because if we put ourselves the question: Why are we here? Why is DF necessary? Is it not precisely to ensure a greater understanding of what makes Denmark a unique country? Is it not precisely to ensure greater support for Denmark as a safe environment for future generations too? And when more and more people - including people who previously believed in multiculturalism and multireligiousness - now realize that they were wrong, we should not welcome them to a common fight for the country that we care so much about. at 10 minutes past 12. A lot has gone wrong. But we can still save our country. But it requires determination. Purpose. Consistency. We have it! Welcome to the 2017 annual meeting here in Herning! We are gathered again in these lovely, warm surroundings .Here in Herning Midtby.Where over a few days we will enjoy each other's company.Have many political discussions - but also have time to party.We have a reputation for having the best party among the parties - shall we not show tonight, that it fits? I'm already looking forward to it!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- In June I was in the beautiful Haderslev Cathedral, where we marked the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. A completely decisive milestone in our history. In many ways a foundation for that society , we know today. The Reformation actually paved the way for us today to have a so-called secular society. Where we can rest in our religion. Know our point of view. But don't use the priest in church on Sunday to tell us how we on Tuesday will vote in the Folketing. It actually works very well! But Islam stands against this as a religion of law. Which is hardly compatible with a society like ours. Where a so-called ""absolute truth"" is defined to a much greater extent. I think that is a little over a month ago, one day I was driving in a car - and heard on the radio - a professor talking about a large study that had been carried out in a number of countries. They had asked different populations if they believed that there is a absolute truth. The results were telling. In Pakistan - which you know is a strictly Islamic country - 95 percent answered YES! There is an absolute truth. In Turkey, just outside the border with the EU, 85 percent answered yes. In Great Britain the figure was down to 45 per cent. And here in Denmark? Well... Five per cent. I think that is telling in many ways. We have a healthy skepticism here at home. The Danes - we have progressed! Not least because of this, the combination of a secular western people's government like ours and Islam so difficult. An almost insurmountable problem. But we deal with problems. Or challenges as we call them. Even if they seem terribly big. We have suggestions for solutions - I will come back to them.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Since we met a year ago, quite a lot has happened. The narrow Liberal government has become the VLAK government. Ultimate demands for top tax reductions have been replaced by seats in ministerial cars. The Danish People's Party has gained an even greater role. We can now alone majority with the government. But we can also in many situations choose to create a majority outside the government when we find it necessary. Having more paths to take gives greater influence. Therefore, in the situation last year, it was good that the Liberals expanded the government with LA and K. It certainly hasn't made life harder for us. But it hasn't made life harder for us either, that the Social Democratic Party with Mette Frederiksen at the helm has chosen to replace previous hate campaigns against DF with an outstretched hand for cooperation. That hand we have accepted. And since the Social Democratic Party is holding a congress in Aalborg at the same time as our annual meeting here in Herning, I think we should send a greeting north. With the hope that the Social Democratic Party's hinterland will support their party leadership's change of course regarding immigration policy and thus cooperate with us. I read at one point that the party had given Henrik Sass Larsen a ""roaring ban"". But quite frankly: Dear Social Democrats. If you want to show that you have taken the full step, then let Henrik Sass roar at the top of his lungs blow out! And then one more thing... Because there is one more party that is holding a national meeting this weekend. The wing party The Radical Left. This party stands together with Alternativet and Enhedslisten for everything that the previously mentioned Uffe √òstergaard has abandoned. About the multi-cultural, the multi-religious. In reality, about everything that breaks down the community and the cohesion that we care about in our country. If I could get Aladdin's lamp - if I could get the spirit of the lamp out and grant me one wish. Yes - then it would be that the Social Democrats guarantee this weekend from Aalborg that the radicals in Nyborg will have absolutely no influence on immigration policy in the future. Guarantees that regardless of whether the so-called red bloc wins a forthcoming general election, the radicals, Alternativet, Enhedslisten will have no influence on immigration policy. Because just as I do not think that the last mandate of the Liberal Alliance should dictate tax policy, I also do not think that it the last mandate of the radicals or of the Alternative must dictate the immigration policy. On the contrary, I think that the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Danish People's Party across the blocs must guarantee the Danes that from now on immigration will be kept under control. That we will not let it go wrong again. That it is now the border guards who have taken power - and that the border guards have been given time off. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- We are busy. There are a lot of things we have to manage! We have, among other things, witnessed completely absurd situations in Copenhagen in particular. Innocents have been shot. Hard-boiled criminals have completely disregarded all Danish rules and norms. The police have had to advise young people to stay indoors to avoid being hit. The gangs have been wreaking havoc. One of these gangs is the so-called Loyal to Familia. The leader is Pakistani. His name is Shuaib Khan. He is not a Danish citizen - and he has been in prison several times. Among other things for fatal violence against a man in Jomfru Ane Gade in Aalborg. The 21-year-old man received 14 deep stab wounds, as well as being kicked and beaten with broken bottles, chairs and fists. He died from it. Shuaib Khan, together with a group of others, received a sentence for the death penalty, Shuaib Khan was released on parole after only four years. He has not been deported from Denmark! What do you think we should put up with such a man? Don't you just think that he should be thrown out of our country? I mean it! Next, we must have closed the gangs that cause violence and insecurity. Loyal to familia, Brothas, Black Army and whatever else they are all called. Their only purpose is violence, drug dealing, extortion and everything else that we cannot or must accept here in Denmark. That it has also just come to light that 63 percent of the gang members who per.1. May 2017 was registered in the police's special gang register, received cash assistance during 2016, alongside their crime, is absolutely wrong. But don't we have our good, old constitution to stop such things! You would think so. Section 78 of the Basic Law says precisely that associations that work through violence can be banned. Then we wouldn't see to start. No more words about iron fists and zero tolerance. Shut down those gangs! They have done that in several places in Germany. With good results as a result. This must also happen here in Denmark! And then the gangs have to take the case to the courts afterwards if they want to try to get the ban lifted again. But a ban gives the police more powers to stop the gangs' rampage. And our task is to ensure the security of the Danes. So it's just a matter of getting started. We must have created a state of law where it is possible to send criminals like Levakovic and Shuaib Khan out of Denmark. We must decide for ourselves how many and which migrants we want to enter our country. We must make sure that potential terrorists are denied citizenship in Denmark. Exactly these examples show areas where there is still a majority in the Folketing to put the conventions above common sense. One has to ask himself: Have the conventions kept up with the times? Or do the conventions ‚Äì as they are interpreted today ‚Äì prevent common sense from taking place. The answer is self-evident... The conventions are precisely to blame for the fact that Levakovic, who has 28 convictions behind him and who also has never contributed positively to Danish society, has not smoked on a plane home to Croatia for a long time. We can thank the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights for that. The same convention that protects Shuaib Khan from smoking home to Pakistan. in that a Syrian refugee could have the family reunification of his ‚Äì hold on tight ‚Äì 17 children, whom he has with three different wives. The interpretation of conventions was also the reason why a majority in the Danish Parliament in 2014 granted citizenship to a foreigner, even though the person concerned The police's intelligence service was assessed to be a danger to Denmark's security. As recently as this summer, the Supreme Court assessed that the European Convention on Human Rights prevented a group of Romanians from being sent home for prosecution in a case of serious human trafficking. The Supreme Court assessed , that if they were found guilty - GUILTY - they would have a room in prison that would be too small in relation to their human rights. Therefore, these people may not now be held accountable for their deeds in Romania. But we hang on them here in Denmark. Completely absurd! I am getting tired of the fact that criminal foreigners can seek shelter behind international conventions. That simply cannot have been the intention of the conventions. That is why we must keep the government on its promise to seek the conventions changed. But also make it clear that if this cannot be done, then Denmark must be prepared to challenge the conventions - and if that is not enough, then make reservations for the parts of the conventions that prevent us from expelling criminal aliens of the country. We no longer want to be laughed at for our own money.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The people we allow into our country must want to be a positive contribution to Denmark. People we would like to see come. People who come with an honest heart to contribute - not to undermine our country. Such people - whether it is to work or as tourists, must be warmly welcomed. And don't the populations of most countries think like that? I think so! But to ensure that, of course, you have to have control at your borders. At the front door. Control at a country's borders is natural. It is Schengen's borderless Europe that is unnatural .I really find it difficult to understand why it should be a discussion whether to guard one's border or not. Regardless of whether one day the EU should succeed in getting control of the EU's external borders - and I doubt that it ever will happen - then we want to take the view that Denmark must guard its border. Friendly, but firm. Open to the good guests, closed to those we don't want in. So therefore to the rest of the Parliament: Don't leave it to a Greek EU Commissioner to decide whether Denmark must have border control. Let's state that border control is here to stay. Now let's get that border control expanded and made permanent!_ One of our slogans is: There is so much we have to watch out! I think that fits so well with what it's all about. We have so much we want to watch out for. And there are so many dangers out there that we have to watch out for! What do you think if I mention‚Ä¶ Paris Copenhagen Brussels Nice Berlin Stockholm Manchester Barcelona London Yes ‚Äì You have probably guessed it. Cities in Europe where Islamic terrorists have committed terrorist attacks. We have a hard time dealing with how to react when once again are told that terrorists have mowed down a crowd with a truck, or stabbed innocent bystanders with knives, or as we saw yesterday, tried to detonate a bomb on the London Underground. We HAVE to open our eyes to this one new world and the enemy who wants us to die. We must recognize that many of the terrorists are people who grew up in the countries themselves. Perhaps they got inspiration from outside but also got a hatred for the country they grew up in, which can cause them to commit terrorism. Therefore we will have to ask: What do Muslim children learn at the Muslim free schools? against the infidels? When it is necessary to have a quarter of the Muslim free schools under strict supervision. Should our free mind accommodate such schools? Or is it too naive to let it stand. I mean the latter! Or when we hear about mosques that invite preachers of hate on the pulpits who call for violence, killing and stoning. Where you do not want to distance yourself from Islamic State - where you pay tribute to terrorists, as we have seen in, for example, the Grimh√∏j Mosque in Aarhus. No. We must not be naive. Take the money away them. Stress them so that it is difficult for them to recruit more fanatics. It is completely crazy that we spend taxpayers' money on schools that teach jihad and on mosques that preach hate right here in the middle of our own Denmark. We must speak up. We have to say stop. And for those who don't like the smell in the bakery here - then go to your like-minded people in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East. But don't destroy our young people with your twisted medieval nonsense.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî - One of the really big political issues in these years is called Brexit. On 23 June 2016, the British voted for continued membership of the EU. There was a majority in favor of ""Leave"" - ‚Äã‚Äãto make Britain independent again. Great Britain is an important ally for Denmark. Our soldiers are some of those who work most closely together in international missions. The British and the Danes have been close for generations. It was British Field Marshal Montgomery who issued the legendary announcement that the German troops in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark had surrendered. Who doesn't remember that particular scene from Matador? The one where bank director Varn√¶s surprises the fine company by tearing down the hated blackout curtains after they have heard the wonderful news over the radio from England? Fantastic. The British are our friends. The British are our allies. The British are our close trading partners. They should be in the future as well. But the next few years will be decisive in terms of how the close bond can be maintained. The question the British asked themselves in their referendum on 23 June 2016, was basically whether they saw the EU as part of the solution or as part of the problem. The answer was that the EU was mostly part of the problem. I understand the British answer. The EU has, for example, asked the member states to remove their border controls under the pretext that the so-called external borders were under control. But the truth is that the external borders will never be controlled. When you saw the outcry when Hungary actually wanted to enforce its border, you know that the political will is not present. The EU has adopted a forced distribution of up to 120,000 migrants. Although Hungary and Slovenia have tried to have the decision overturned at the European Court of Justice, it has been established that the EU has the right to require migrants to be forcibly distributed to certain countries in the EU. After this judgment, haven't many Danes been confirmed that it is good that we have the reservation of rights? It is precisely this reservation that means that the EU cannot force these migrants to Denmark! But the thinking itself in this forced placement is absurd. And of course undermines the countries' sovereignty quite violently. And then the German Chancellor Merkel showed in autumn 2015 that in the EU it is the right of the strongest. When Germany wants, our common rules are irrelevant. Because then Merkel agreed that 1 million people could migrate up through Europe, which at this time was without internal border controls, she looked big on the common rules, which is otherwise the main argument that the EU is especially good for small countries. With these examples - and many more could be mentioned - it is completely understandable that the UK has had enough. Now it is about how to make a good agreement between the EU and the UK. A good agreement is an agreement where both parties stand as winners .Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Brussels for the British to come out badly. That there must be a penalty in opting out of the EU. This is completely unsympathetic. Perhaps for Brussels it is also about being afraid of , that a good agreement ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãalso for the British ‚Äì will make others (Denmark) see possibilities for a new association with the EU? members to by using fear and threats about all the terrible things that will happen if you don't want to join in. The EU must not look like one of the rock gangs that ravage our streets in that respect. So we will insist that work is being done loyally and dutifully to make a good agreement for the British and for the EU - including Denmark. And what is a good agreement? The most important thing is free trade. That our companies can sell goods as freely as possible in the other countries. Denmark has a colossal interest in having free market access ‚Äì also to Great Britain. Just think of our entire food cluster. It is an old truth that if you want the best Danish bacon, you have to go to England. set it aside. But why is free trade between Denmark and Great Britain threatened? Between the EU and Great Britain threatened? Simply for one reason only: Namely that the EU has set as a requirement for free trade that Great Britain accepts continued free immigration from, for example, the Eastern European countries. is a hoot! When you have followed the British debate, you know that this is exactly where the British must regain full control. On the issue of immigration! The British are simply so tired of being able to move around in large parts of, among other things, London and having endless difficulty finding a Brit. I was in London the day former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died. There were extra editions of the newspapers, which were distributed around that afternoon. TV broadcast extras. It was really big. But most of the people I met on my way were Eastern Europeans. So when I asked what they thought about the death, which was all over the front of the newspapers, everywhere on TV, they replied that they had never heard of it the lady. They simply didn't know who she was and many of them were also numbingly indifferent. That doesn't make them bad people. But it destroys the cohesion of a country when there is no shared history. Shared memory. So the British want control immigration. And I ask: Is it in our interest ‚Äì is it in Denmark's interest that the British are kept as much as possible in the internal market with free trade ‚Äì and in return get full rights to control immigration to their country? The answer is quite simple. Of course it is! But is that the position of the Danish government in the EU? No. And exactly here I would like to make a request to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. Make it clear to the other countries in the EU that we want a new negotiating line from the EU's side. That we want the EU to tell the British that if they stay in our free trade area, they will of course decide on immigration themselves. This is the only logical thing! Because why should the condition that you can trade with each other at the same time be that Roma can travel freely to beg and create insecurity. Or that you are obliged to send child benefits to children in Romania and Poland. Children who may never have set foot in the country that has to pay the bill. Why do we have to put up with migrant workers undermining the conditions on our labor market. Why do we have to put up with wage suppression and worse working conditions - in order to be able to trade with each other? Of course we don't have to either. The EU's rules have distanced themselves from common sense .It must be changed. And let's use the Brexit negotiations to ensure just that!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì By the way, it is worrying to watch the coverage of Brexit in the media. Great Britain is a democracy. They have had a referendum. Their politicians then discusses what is wise for them to do. Is it healthy? Yes ‚Äì one would think so. But when it is transmitted back home to Denmark by DR and TV2 and the written press, it always turns out that in Great Britain is chaos. That they don't know what they want. That there is political arm-twisting that is tearing the country apart. Negative negative negative. And all stories are turned around so that it seems like doomsday. If a survey shows that 30-35 percent are considering leaving the UK over the coming years, it will be people fleeing because of Brexit. Nevermind that 65-70 percent won't. Or an assessment that there are people coming and going all the time, why the number may be close to what it usually is. And their economy is in tatters, we must understand! If it is an expression of the press that is also in Great Britain, it is particularly interesting that many measurements show that the majority for Brexit is intact. Conversely with the media's coverage of the EU's negotiating position. References are made as if it were the EU's own press department that briefed. And usually we are simply told that such and such is the EU's position. No critical questions about why. Or whether the EU's position is reasonable! The completely deadlocked connection of the question of whether one must accept free immigration in order to be part of the free trade area was, for example, established in the EU at a meeting just a few days after the British referendum in June 2016. that's in place! But no journalists in the major national media have asked critical questions about it. It's just been interpreted as a fact. So the highly critical journalism is wild and bloody when it comes to the coverage in London. But it disappears completely in the mists when it comes to Brussels. This is not just sad. It is harmful to our democracy. So, dear journalists. Can we make an agreement? Before the next annual meeting, you must promise to ask just one critical question to Brussels, for every time you doing 5 critical features from London. Think - could we just get there... ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- It has become autumn in Denmark. And autumn has obviously become synonymous with discussions about tax. Now it is at least the second year in a row, that we must put our hands on the tax policy. The course is chalked up. The government has played out with big plans. Both in relation to tax, business and financial law. The coming two months will show what a majority can be made for. And let me just hit fixed: In DF, we have nothing against the Danes keeping more of their money in their own pockets. But we have two crucial prerequisites for this to be possible. The first is that there is sufficient money in our common coffers to the challenges we have ahead of us. The second is that there is a reasonableness between top and bottom. We lack hands in our elderly care. In the future, there will be more elderly people. Also more elderly people who manage themselves. It is absolutely only positive. But there are also more elderly people - including those with dementia who need help and care. Only people with their hearts in the right place can provide it. And that requires resources. So we know that we must prioritize the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly more than we do today. No one should tremble at the thought of a care home where you have to spend the night on the floor if you have fallen out of bed. Or fear sitting forgotten on the toilet for hours or not having a shower, as you have otherwise been used to. We must ensure dignity for our elderly. Our healthcare system runs on the pumps in many places. In Denmark, we have thousands of super-skilled doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and all the other groups we have on our hospitals, doctors' offices, etc. But for many years we have also demanded that they run stronger. For over 15 years we have had a so-called productivity requirement - in the past many years of 2 percent per year. The hospitals have delivered. Thank you for that .This has meant, among other things, that we do not talk about waiting lists at all today, as we did years ago. But we now say clearly that time has run out from the rigid demand for increased productivity, as it has been formulated. It is working our staff down. It's no longer the right way to do it. That's why we want it gone! And the sooner the better. There are plenty of people in the health care system who have been shouting guard for a long time. The most recent was a professor and senior physician Liselotte H√∏jgaard, head of clinic at Rigshospitalet. In a new debate book, she makes a harsh criticism of the conditions in the healthcare system. ""The system is chronically ill and lies in a bed in intensive care because someone is standing on the oxygen tube,"" she says. We needs committed employees in the healthcare system. And therefore we must take the concerns of the healthcare staff seriously and show them that we are both listening and acting. In the same way, we have a police force that is pushed to the limit. More and more tasks - but not more officers. The resources have been prioritized for people at the desks, but to that extent there is also a need for skilled visible police officers on the streets throughout the country. We saw the need early on. Actually went to the polls in 2015 on a plan for a net 2,000 more officers over the following 10 years. And it is going the right way with training more officers, but it takes time. Most recently, we have trained first team of police cadets, who must relieve the police, e.g. at the border. Unfortunately, a dispute over their terms of employment has meant that they are not functioning yet. A strong call from here to get this resolved quickly. Decisive for many of the right good people, we have in care for the elderly, in the hospitals, the police don't know whether they think it's too busy right now. It's whether there is a perspective of better conditions. More resources. Whether people really listen from the political side .But if there is no money left, when tax cuts have been given, the hope for better conditions disappears. Then the solid - capable - people will lose courage. Then they will find other places to work. And then we will find it even more difficult to deliver a proper welfare society. That must not happen. That is why there must be money in the coffers to strengthen our welfare society when the autumn agreements have been concluded.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì And when we talk about taxes. Then we also talk about top and bottom. About people who earn a lot of money and people with low incomes. The government got off a bit wrong with the director and the HK on minimum wage. They based the calculations on the fact that a director and a HK had the same expenditure on housing. And what was their plan for greatest benefit for the HK. I wonder if we have become wiser there? But that followed on the heels of a statement from Anders Samuelsen that the government had now dropped top tax relief. Because people in the government had read that it was probably not right what we thought was highest on the list of wishes. But when the proposal came, it was with a proposal to remove the so-called ceiling on the employment deduction. It may sound a bit dry. But whoa: Doesn't it have exactly the same effect as reducing The top tax? Yes. The proposal means that a very large proportion of the tax relief will be given to precisely those who earn the most. And the higher the income ‚Äì the higher the relief. One must quietly ask our friends in the government: Don't you think your policy will be discovered?

54329.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech to DF's annual meeting 2017. The spoken word applies. Currently we can see an advertisement with Mads Mikkelsen cycling through Copenhagen. The advertisement is about why we in Denmark are one of the happiest people in the world. Why are we? Mads Mikkelsen cycling through the streets - over a well-laid table with happy people to end up in Valby. Inside the old brewer Jacobsen's brewery. The advertisement ends by stating that the happiness of the Danes could also be about a single important thing: Beer! Carlsberg. The best beer in the world! Probably. This advertisement is just one example of Denmark selling! Selling well! We can do it! We're happy! yes, almost wherever you turn, it's about all the good things Denmark can achievers. So we are simply one of the best countries in the world. In the American presidential election campaign we were highlighted. Everyone is looking to see if there is something they can learn from ‚Äì copy. Lots of people want to come here. even if it is for minimum wages. Whether it is other Europeans who want to study at our educational institutions. People from the Middle East and Africa who want to come here and share in our welfare. They all look at Denmark and think; if only we could live in such a country - then all problems would be solved! We - that is, primarily the generations before us - have created a fantastic country. We should be proud of that. Happy for it. But every responsible politician must keep quiet themselves the question: How can we ensure that we can say the same in 20 years. In 50 years. In 100 years? That Denmark is the best country in the world. How can we hand over what we have received to future generations with pride and say; we have managed our heritage well - and we can now pass it on to you in at least the same condition as when we received it. What does it take? About a year ago, Jyllands-Posten had a rather interesting manager. Ok - it has they also had since. But this particular one is worth sticking with. I have saved it. The leader quotes the American commentator and journalist Christopher Caldwell, who in a book from 2009 asked the simple, but according to Jyllands-Posten absolutely central question: Can Europe will remain the Europe we know, with a different population than the current one. Culturally, politically and economically? Caldwell's answer was ""hardly"". The leader goes on to explain that Europe should be aware of the reasons for the continent's success in the half century after The Second World War. In order to ensure peace, after the First and Second World Wars, the Europeans set about building homogeneous nation-states, so that the cause of civil war and discord in the past was minimized. Therefore - the leader continues - it is perfectly legitimate and in accordance with expensively bought experience , if the European societies want to maintain a certain homogeneity. Diversity is not a value in itself.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì Homogeneity! Isn't this precisely the prerequisite for a country to stick together? Cohesion. Feeling of true community. It is in every that's what former professor ‚Äì even Jean Monnet professor ‚Äì Uffe √òstergaard has come to after many years. Uffe √òstergaard has previously been a sharp opponent for us. Was close to former Venstre chairman Uffe Ellemann's EU socks. So you know like, what type we are dealing with... But he has come up with other ideas. And good for that! Now he says this: ""I thought for many years that the cohesion of our society could easily hold up to immigration. But I have recognized, that our social model is more fragile than I thought. We must not be so modest. It is not enough that the people who come to Denmark with a different culture and religion than ours comply with the country's laws. They must stand up for our society, and they must assimilate, otherwise we cannot maintain cohesion. We must dare to say that we demand assimilation."" And he continues: ""It is our triumph that we are so homogeneous, and we must protect that. We have not paid attention to this historical difference here at home."" When the media and leading figures in this way realize that the previously significant immigration to Denmark has undermined our country, we can of course raise our eyebrows and say; what did we say! But instead of hovering, I would much rather embrace. I am glad that there are more and more behind the basic analysis of Denmark's challenges, which we have always had in the Danish People's Party. Because if we put ourselves the question: Why are we here? Why is DF necessary? Is it not precisely to ensure a greater understanding of what makes Denmark a unique country? Is it not precisely to ensure greater support for Denmark as a safe environment for future generations too? And when more and more people - including people who previously believed in multiculturalism and multireligiousness - now realize that they were wrong, we should not welcome them to a common fight for the country that we care so much about. at 10 minutes past 12. A lot has gone wrong. But we can still save our country. But it requires determination. Purpose. Consistency. We have it! Welcome to the 2017 annual meeting here in Herning! We are gathered again in these lovely, warm surroundings .Here in Herning Midtby.Where over a few days we will enjoy each other's company.Have many political discussions - but also have time to party.We have a reputation for having the best party among the parties - shall we not show tonight, that it fits? I'm already looking forward to it!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- In June I was in the beautiful Haderslev Cathedral, where we marked the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. A completely decisive milestone in our history. In many ways a foundation for that society , we know today. The Reformation actually paved the way for us today to have a so-called secular society. Where we can rest in our religion. Know our point of view. But don't use the priest in church on Sunday to tell us how we on Tuesday will vote in the Folketing. It actually works very well! But Islam stands against this as a religion of law. Which is hardly compatible with a society like ours. Where a so-called ""absolute truth"" is defined to a much greater extent. I think that is a little over a month ago, one day I was driving in a car - and heard on the radio - a professor talking about a large study that had been carried out in a number of countries. They had asked different populations if they believed that there is a absolute truth. The results were telling. In Pakistan - which you know is a strictly Islamic country - 95 percent answered YES! There is an absolute truth. In Turkey, just outside the border with the EU, 85 percent answered yes. In Great Britain the figure was down to 45 per cent. And here in Denmark? Well... Five per cent. I think that is telling in many ways. We have a healthy skepticism here at home. The Danes - we have progressed! Not least because of this, the combination of a secular western people's government like ours and Islam so difficult. An almost insurmountable problem. But we deal with problems. Or challenges as we call them. Even if they seem terribly big. We have suggestions for solutions - I will come back to them.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Since we met a year ago, quite a lot has happened. The narrow Liberal government has become the VLAK government. Ultimate demands for top tax reductions have been replaced by seats in ministerial cars. The Danish People's Party has gained an even greater role. We can now alone majority with the government. But we can also in many situations choose to create a majority outside the government when we find it necessary. Having more paths to take gives greater influence. Therefore, in the situation last year, it was good that the Liberals expanded the government with LA and K. It certainly hasn't made life harder for us. But it hasn't made life harder for us either, that the Social Democratic Party with Mette Frederiksen at the helm has chosen to replace previous hate campaigns against DF with an outstretched hand for cooperation. That hand we have accepted. And since the Social Democratic Party is holding a congress in Aalborg at the same time as our annual meeting here in Herning, I think we should send a greeting north. With the hope that the Social Democratic Party's hinterland will support their party leadership's change of course regarding immigration policy and thus cooperate with us. I read at one point that the party had given Henrik Sass Larsen a ""roaring ban"". But quite frankly: Dear Social Democrats. If you want to show that you have taken the full step, then let Henrik Sass roar at the top of his lungs blow out! And then one more thing... Because there is one more party that is holding a national meeting this weekend. The wing party The Radical Left. This party stands together with Alternativet and Enhedslisten for everything that the previously mentioned Uffe √òstergaard has abandoned. About the multi-cultural, the multi-religious. In reality, about everything that breaks down the community and the cohesion that we care about in our country. If I could get Aladdin's lamp - if I could get the spirit of the lamp out and grant me one wish. Yes - then it would be that the Social Democrats guarantee this weekend from Aalborg that the radicals in Nyborg will have absolutely no influence on immigration policy in the future. Guarantees that regardless of whether the so-called red bloc wins a forthcoming general election, the radicals, Alternativet, Enhedslisten will have no influence on immigration policy. Because just as I do not think that the last mandate of the Liberal Alliance should dictate tax policy, I also do not think that it the last mandate of the radicals or of the Alternative must dictate the immigration policy. On the contrary, I think that the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Danish People's Party across the blocs must guarantee the Danes that from now on immigration will be kept under control. That we will not let it go wrong again. That it is now the border guards who have taken power - and that the border guards have been given time off. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- We are busy. There are a lot of things we have to manage! We have, among other things, witnessed completely absurd situations in Copenhagen in particular. Innocents have been shot. Hard-boiled criminals have completely disregarded all Danish rules and norms. The police have had to advise young people to stay indoors to avoid being hit. The gangs have been wreaking havoc. One of these gangs is the so-called Loyal to Familia. The leader is Pakistani. His name is Shuaib Khan. He is not a Danish citizen - and he has been in prison several times. Among other things for fatal violence against a man in Jomfru Ane Gade in Aalborg. The 21-year-old man received 14 deep stab wounds, as well as being kicked and beaten with broken bottles, chairs and fists. He died from it. Shuaib Khan, together with a group of others, received a sentence for the death penalty, Shuaib Khan was released on parole after only four years. He has not been deported from Denmark! What do you think we should put up with such a man? Don't you just think that he should be thrown out of our country? I mean it! Next, we must have closed the gangs that cause violence and insecurity. Loyal to familia, Brothas, Black Army and whatever else they are all called. Their only purpose is violence, drug dealing, extortion and everything else that we cannot or must accept here in Denmark. That it has also just come to light that 63 percent of the gang members who per.1. May 2017 was registered in the police's special gang register, received cash assistance during 2016, alongside their crime, is absolutely wrong. But don't we have our good, old constitution to stop such things! You would think so. Section 78 of the Basic Law says precisely that associations that work through violence can be banned. Then we wouldn't see to start. No more words about iron fists and zero tolerance. Shut down those gangs! They have done that in several places in Germany. With good results as a result. This must also happen here in Denmark! And then the gangs have to take the case to the courts afterwards if they want to try to get the ban lifted again. But a ban gives the police more powers to stop the gangs' rampage. And our task is to ensure the security of the Danes. So it's just a matter of getting started. We must have created a state of law where it is possible to send criminals like Levakovic and Shuaib Khan out of Denmark. We must decide for ourselves how many and which migrants we want to enter our country. We must make sure that potential terrorists are denied citizenship in Denmark. Exactly these examples show areas where there is still a majority in the Folketing to put the conventions above common sense. One has to ask himself: Have the conventions kept up with the times? Or do the conventions ‚Äì as they are interpreted today ‚Äì prevent common sense from taking place. The answer is self-evident... The conventions are precisely to blame for the fact that Levakovic, who has 28 convictions behind him and who also has never contributed positively to Danish society, has not smoked on a plane home to Croatia for a long time. We can thank the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights for that. The same convention that protects Shuaib Khan from smoking home to Pakistan. in that a Syrian refugee could have the family reunification of his ‚Äì hold on tight ‚Äì 17 children, whom he has with three different wives. The interpretation of conventions was also the reason why a majority in the Danish Parliament in 2014 granted citizenship to a foreigner, even though the person concerned The police's intelligence service was assessed to be a danger to Denmark's security. As recently as this summer, the Supreme Court assessed that the European Convention on Human Rights prevented a group of Romanians from being sent home for prosecution in a case of serious human trafficking. The Supreme Court assessed , that if they were found guilty - GUILTY - they would have a room in prison that would be too small in relation to their human rights. Therefore, these people may not now be held accountable for their deeds in Romania. But we hang on them here in Denmark. Completely absurd! I am getting tired of the fact that criminal foreigners can seek shelter behind international conventions. That simply cannot have been the intention of the conventions. That is why we must keep the government on its promise to seek the conventions changed. But also make it clear that if this cannot be done, then Denmark must be prepared to challenge the conventions - and if that is not enough, then make reservations for the parts of the conventions that prevent us from expelling criminal aliens of the country. We no longer want to be laughed at for our own money.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The people we allow into our country must want to be a positive contribution to Denmark. People we would like to see come. People who come with an honest heart to contribute - not to undermine our country. Such people - whether it is to work or as tourists, must be warmly welcomed. And don't the populations of most countries think like that? I think so! But to ensure that, of course, you have to have control at your borders. At the front door. Control at a country's borders is natural. It is Schengen's borderless Europe that is unnatural .I really find it difficult to understand why it should be a discussion whether to guard one's border or not. Regardless of whether one day the EU should succeed in getting control of the EU's external borders - and I doubt that it ever will happen - then we want to take the view that Denmark must guard its border. Friendly, but firm. Open to the good guests, closed to those we don't want in. So therefore to the rest of the Parliament: Don't leave it to a Greek EU Commissioner to decide whether Denmark must have border control. Let's state that border control is here to stay. Now let's get that border control expanded and made permanent!_ One of our slogans is: There is so much we have to watch out! I think that fits so well with what it's all about. We have so much we want to watch out for. And there are so many dangers out there that we have to watch out for! What do you think if I mention‚Ä¶ Paris Copenhagen Brussels Nice Berlin Stockholm Manchester Barcelona London Yes ‚Äì You have probably guessed it. Cities in Europe where Islamic terrorists have committed terrorist attacks. We have a hard time dealing with how to react when once again are told that terrorists have mowed down a crowd with a truck, or stabbed innocent bystanders with knives, or as we saw yesterday, tried to detonate a bomb on the London Underground. We HAVE to open our eyes to this one new world and the enemy who wants us to die. We must recognize that many of the terrorists are people who grew up in the countries themselves. Perhaps they got inspiration from outside but also got a hatred for the country they grew up in, which can cause them to commit terrorism. Therefore we will have to ask: What do Muslim children learn at the Muslim free schools? against the infidels? When it is necessary to have a quarter of the Muslim free schools under strict supervision. Should our free mind accommodate such schools? Or is it too naive to let it stand. I mean the latter! Or when we hear about mosques that invite preachers of hate on the pulpits who call for violence, killing and stoning. Where you do not want to distance yourself from Islamic State - where you pay tribute to terrorists, as we have seen in, for example, the Grimh√∏j Mosque in Aarhus. No. We must not be naive. Take the money away them. Stress them so that it is difficult for them to recruit more fanatics. It is completely crazy that we spend taxpayers' money on schools that teach jihad and on mosques that preach hate right here in the middle of our own Denmark. We must speak up. We have to say stop. And for those who don't like the smell in the bakery here - then go to your like-minded people in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East. But don't destroy our young people with your twisted medieval nonsense.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî - One of the really big political issues in these years is called Brexit. On 23 June 2016, the British voted for continued membership of the EU. There was a majority in favor of ""Leave"" - ‚Äã‚Äãto make Britain independent again. Great Britain is an important ally for Denmark. Our soldiers are some of those who work most closely together in international missions. The British and the Danes have been close for generations. It was British Field Marshal Montgomery who issued the legendary announcement that the German troops in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark had surrendered. Who doesn't remember that particular scene from Matador? The one where bank director Varn√¶s surprises the fine company by tearing down the hated blackout curtains after they have heard the wonderful news over the radio from England? Fantastic. The British are our friends. The British are our allies. The British are our close trading partners. They should be in the future as well. But the next few years will be decisive in terms of how the close bond can be maintained. The question the British asked themselves in their referendum on 23 June 2016, was basically whether they saw the EU as part of the solution or as part of the problem. The answer was that the EU was mostly part of the problem. I understand the British answer. The EU has, for example, asked the member states to remove their border controls under the pretext that the so-called external borders were under control. But the truth is that the external borders will never be controlled. When you saw the outcry when Hungary actually wanted to enforce its border, you know that the political will is not present. The EU has adopted a forced distribution of up to 120,000 migrants. Although Hungary and Slovenia have tried to have the decision overturned at the European Court of Justice, it has been established that the EU has the right to require migrants to be forcibly distributed to certain countries in the EU. After this judgment, haven't many Danes been confirmed that it is good that we have the reservation of rights? It is precisely this reservation that means that the EU cannot force these migrants to Denmark! But the thinking itself in this forced placement is absurd. And of course undermines the countries' sovereignty quite violently. And then the German Chancellor Merkel showed in autumn 2015 that in the EU it is the right of the strongest. When Germany wants, our common rules are irrelevant. Because then Merkel agreed that 1 million people could migrate up through Europe, which at this time was without internal border controls, she looked big on the common rules, which is otherwise the main argument that the EU is especially good for small countries. With these examples - and many more could be mentioned - it is completely understandable that the UK has had enough. Now it is about how to make a good agreement between the EU and the UK. A good agreement is an agreement where both parties stand as winners .Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Brussels for the British to come out badly. That there must be a penalty in opting out of the EU. This is completely unsympathetic. Perhaps for Brussels it is also about being afraid of , that a good agreement ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãalso for the British ‚Äì will make others (Denmark) see possibilities for a new association with the EU? members to by using fear and threats about all the terrible things that will happen if you don't want to join in. The EU must not look like one of the rock gangs that ravage our streets in that respect. So we will insist that work is being done loyally and dutifully to make a good agreement for the British and for the EU - including Denmark. And what is a good agreement? The most important thing is free trade. That our companies can sell goods as freely as possible in the other countries. Denmark has a colossal interest in having free market access ‚Äì also to Great Britain. Just think of our entire food cluster. It is an old truth that if you want the best Danish bacon, you have to go to England. set it aside. But why is free trade between Denmark and Great Britain threatened? Between the EU and Great Britain threatened? Simply for one reason only: Namely that the EU has set as a requirement for free trade that Great Britain accepts continued free immigration from, for example, the Eastern European countries. is a hoot! When you have followed the British debate, you know that this is exactly where the British must regain full control. On the issue of immigration! The British are simply so tired of being able to move around in large parts of, among other things, London and having endless difficulty finding a Brit. I was in London the day former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died. There were extra editions of the newspapers, which were distributed around that afternoon. TV broadcast extras. It was really big. But most of the people I met on my way were Eastern Europeans. So when I asked what they thought about the death, which was all over the front of the newspapers, everywhere on TV, they replied that they had never heard of it the lady. They simply didn't know who she was and many of them were also numbingly indifferent. That doesn't make them bad people. But it destroys the cohesion of a country when there is no shared history. Shared memory. So the British want control immigration. And I ask: Is it in our interest ‚Äì is it in Denmark's interest that the British are kept as much as possible in the internal market with free trade ‚Äì and in return get full rights to control immigration to their country? The answer is quite simple. Of course it is! But is that the position of the Danish government in the EU? No. And exactly here I would like to make a request to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. Make it clear to the other countries in the EU that we want a new negotiating line from the EU's side. That we want the EU to tell the British that if they stay in our free trade area, they will of course decide on immigration themselves. This is the only logical thing! Because why should the condition that you can trade with each other at the same time be that Roma can travel freely to beg and create insecurity. Or that you are obliged to send child benefits to children in Romania and Poland. Children who may never have set foot in the country that has to pay the bill. Why do we have to put up with migrant workers undermining the conditions on our labor market. Why do we have to put up with wage suppression and worse working conditions - in order to be able to trade with each other? Of course we don't have to either. The EU's rules have distanced themselves from common sense .It must be changed. And let's use the Brexit negotiations to ensure just that!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì By the way, it is worrying to watch the coverage of Brexit in the media. Great Britain is a democracy. They have had a referendum. Their politicians then discusses what is wise for them to do. Is it healthy? Yes ‚Äì one would think so. But when it is transmitted back home to Denmark by DR and TV2 and the written press, it always turns out that in Great Britain is chaos. That they don't know what they want. That there is political arm-twisting that is tearing the country apart. Negative negative negative. And all stories are turned around so that it seems like doomsday. If a survey shows that 30-35 percent are considering leaving the UK over the coming years, it will be people fleeing because of Brexit. Nevermind that 65-70 percent won't. Or an assessment that there are people coming and going all the time, why the number may be close to what it usually is. And their economy is in tatters, we must understand! If it is an expression of the press that is also in Great Britain, it is particularly interesting that many measurements show that the majority for Brexit is intact. Conversely with the media's coverage of the EU's negotiating position. References are made as if it were the EU's own press department that briefed. And usually we are simply told that such and such is the EU's position. No critical questions about why. Or whether the EU's position is reasonable! The completely deadlocked connection of the question of whether one must accept free immigration in order to be part of the free trade area was, for example, established in the EU at a meeting just a few days after the British referendum in June 2016. that's in place! But no journalists in the major national media have asked critical questions about it. It's just been interpreted as a fact. So the highly critical journalism is wild and bloody when it comes to the coverage in London. But it disappears completely in the mists when it comes to Brussels. This is not just sad. It is harmful to our democracy. So, dear journalists. Can we make an agreement? Before the next annual meeting, you must promise to ask just one critical question to Brussels, for every time you doing 5 critical features from London. Think - could we just get there... ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- It has become autumn in Denmark. And autumn has obviously become synonymous with discussions about tax. Now it is at least the second year in a row, that we must put our hands on the tax policy. The course is chalked up. The government has played out with big plans. Both in relation to tax, business and financial law. The coming two months will show what a majority can be made for. And let me just hit fixed: In DF, we have nothing against the Danes keeping more of their money in their own pockets. But we have two crucial prerequisites for this to be possible. The first is that there is sufficient money in our common coffers to the challenges we have ahead of us. The second is that there is a reasonableness between top and bottom. We lack hands in our elderly care. In the future, there will be more elderly people. Also more elderly people who manage themselves. It is absolutely only positive. But there are also more elderly people - including those with dementia who need help and care. Only people with their hearts in the right place can provide it. And that requires resources. So we know that we must prioritize the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly more than we do today. No one should tremble at the thought of a care home where you have to spend the night on the floor if you have fallen out of bed. Or fear sitting forgotten on the toilet for hours or not having a shower, as you have otherwise been used to. We must ensure dignity for our elderly. Our healthcare system runs on the pumps in many places. In Denmark, we have thousands of super-skilled doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and all the other groups we have on our hospitals, doctors' offices, etc. But for many years we have also demanded that they run stronger. For over 15 years we have had a so-called productivity requirement - in the past many years of 2 percent per year. The hospitals have delivered. Thank you for that .This has meant, among other things, that we do not talk about waiting lists at all today, as we did years ago. But we now say clearly that time has run out from the rigid demand for increased productivity, as it has been formulated. It is working our staff down. It's no longer the right way to do it. That's why we want it gone! And the sooner the better. There are plenty of people in the health care system who have been shouting guard for a long time. The most recent was a professor and senior physician Liselotte H√∏jgaard, head of clinic at Rigshospitalet. In a new debate book, she makes a harsh criticism of the conditions in the healthcare system. ""The system is chronically ill and lies in a bed in intensive care because someone is standing on the oxygen tube,"" she says. We needs committed employees in the healthcare system. And therefore we must take the concerns of the healthcare staff seriously and show them that we are both listening and acting. In the same way, we have a police force that is pushed to the limit. More and more tasks - but not more officers. The resources have been prioritized for people at the desks, but to that extent there is also a need for skilled visible police officers on the streets throughout the country. We saw the need early on. Actually went to the polls in 2015 on a plan for a net 2,000 more officers over the following 10 years. And it is going the right way with training more officers, but it takes time. Most recently, we have trained first team of police cadets, who must relieve the police, e.g. at the border. Unfortunately, a dispute over their terms of employment has meant that they are not functioning yet. A strong call from here to get this resolved quickly. Decisive for many of the right good people, we have in care for the elderly, in the hospitals, the police don't know whether they think it's too busy right now. It's whether there is a perspective of better conditions. More resources. Whether people really listen from the political side .But if there is no money left, when tax cuts have been given, the hope for better conditions disappears. Then the solid - capable - people will lose courage. Then they will find other places to work. And then we will find it even more difficult to deliver a proper welfare society. That must not happen. That is why there must be money in the coffers to strengthen our welfare society when the autumn agreements have been concluded.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì And when we talk about taxes. Then we also talk about top and bottom. About people who earn a lot of money and people with low incomes. The government got off a bit wrong with the director and the HK on minimum wage. They based the calculations on the fact that a director and a HK had the same expenditure on housing. And what was their plan for greatest benefit for the HK. I wonder if we have become wiser there? But that followed on the heels of a statement from Anders Samuelsen that the government had now dropped top tax relief. Because people in the government had read that it was probably not right what we thought was highest on the list of wishes. But when the proposal came, it was with a proposal to remove the so-called ceiling on the employment deduction. It may sound a bit dry. But whoa: Doesn't it have exactly the same effect as reducing The top tax? Yes. The proposal means that a very large proportion of the tax relief will be given to precisely those who earn the most. And the higher the income ‚Äì the higher the relief. One must quietly ask our friends in the government: Don't you think your policy will be discovered?

54329.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech to DF's annual meeting 2017. The spoken word applies. Currently we can see an advertisement with Mads Mikkelsen cycling through Copenhagen. The advertisement is about why we in Denmark are one of the happiest people in the world. Why are we? Mads Mikkelsen cycling through the streets - over a well-laid table with happy people to end up in Valby. Inside the old brewer Jacobsen's brewery. The advertisement ends by stating that the happiness of the Danes could also be about a single important thing: Beer! Carlsberg. The best beer in the world! Probably. This advertisement is just one example of Denmark selling! Selling well! We can do it! We're happy! yes, almost wherever you turn, it's about all the good things Denmark can achievers. So we are simply one of the best countries in the world. In the American presidential election campaign we were highlighted. Everyone is looking to see if there is something they can learn from ‚Äì copy. Lots of people want to come here. even if it is for minimum wages. Whether it is other Europeans who want to study at our educational institutions. People from the Middle East and Africa who want to come here and share in our welfare. They all look at Denmark and think; if only we could live in such a country - then all problems would be solved! We - that is, primarily the generations before us - have created a fantastic country. We should be proud of that. Happy for it. But every responsible politician must keep quiet themselves the question: How can we ensure that we can say the same in 20 years. In 50 years. In 100 years? That Denmark is the best country in the world. How can we hand over what we have received to future generations with pride and say; we have managed our heritage well - and we can now pass it on to you in at least the same condition as when we received it. What does it take? About a year ago, Jyllands-Posten had a rather interesting manager. Ok - it has they also had since. But this particular one is worth sticking with. I have saved it. The leader quotes the American commentator and journalist Christopher Caldwell, who in a book from 2009 asked the simple, but according to Jyllands-Posten absolutely central question: Can Europe will remain the Europe we know, with a different population than the current one. Culturally, politically and economically? Caldwell's answer was ""hardly"". The leader goes on to explain that Europe should be aware of the reasons for the continent's success in the half century after The Second World War. In order to ensure peace, after the First and Second World Wars, the Europeans set about building homogeneous nation-states, so that the cause of civil war and discord in the past was minimized. Therefore - the leader continues - it is perfectly legitimate and in accordance with expensively bought experience , if the European societies want to maintain a certain homogeneity. Diversity is not a value in itself.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì Homogeneity! Isn't this precisely the prerequisite for a country to stick together? Cohesion. Feeling of true community. It is in every that's what former professor ‚Äì even Jean Monnet professor ‚Äì Uffe √òstergaard has come to after many years. Uffe √òstergaard has previously been a sharp opponent for us. Was close to former Venstre chairman Uffe Ellemann's EU socks. So you know like, what type we are dealing with... But he has come up with other ideas. And good for that! Now he says this: ""I thought for many years that the cohesion of our society could easily hold up to immigration. But I have recognized, that our social model is more fragile than I thought. We must not be so modest. It is not enough that the people who come to Denmark with a different culture and religion than ours comply with the country's laws. They must stand up for our society, and they must assimilate, otherwise we cannot maintain cohesion. We must dare to say that we demand assimilation."" And he continues: ""It is our triumph that we are so homogeneous, and we must protect that. We have not paid attention to this historical difference here at home."" When the media and leading figures in this way realize that the previously significant immigration to Denmark has undermined our country, we can of course raise our eyebrows and say; what did we say! But instead of hovering, I would much rather embrace. I am glad that there are more and more behind the basic analysis of Denmark's challenges, which we have always had in the Danish People's Party. Because if we put ourselves the question: Why are we here? Why is DF necessary? Is it not precisely to ensure a greater understanding of what makes Denmark a unique country? Is it not precisely to ensure greater support for Denmark as a safe environment for future generations too? And when more and more people - including people who previously believed in multiculturalism and multireligiousness - now realize that they were wrong, we should not welcome them to a common fight for the country that we care so much about. at 10 minutes past 12. A lot has gone wrong. But we can still save our country. But it requires determination. Purpose. Consistency. We have it! Welcome to the 2017 annual meeting here in Herning! We are gathered again in these lovely, warm surroundings .Here in Herning Midtby.Where over a few days we will enjoy each other's company.Have many political discussions - but also have time to party.We have a reputation for having the best party among the parties - shall we not show tonight, that it fits? I'm already looking forward to it!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- In June I was in the beautiful Haderslev Cathedral, where we marked the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. A completely decisive milestone in our history. In many ways a foundation for that society , we know today. The Reformation actually paved the way for us today to have a so-called secular society. Where we can rest in our religion. Know our point of view. But don't use the priest in church on Sunday to tell us how we on Tuesday will vote in the Folketing. It actually works very well! But Islam stands against this as a religion of law. Which is hardly compatible with a society like ours. Where a so-called ""absolute truth"" is defined to a much greater extent. I think that is a little over a month ago, one day I was driving in a car - and heard on the radio - a professor talking about a large study that had been carried out in a number of countries. They had asked different populations if they believed that there is a absolute truth. The results were telling. In Pakistan - which you know is a strictly Islamic country - 95 percent answered YES! There is an absolute truth. In Turkey, just outside the border with the EU, 85 percent answered yes. In Great Britain the figure was down to 45 per cent. And here in Denmark? Well... Five per cent. I think that is telling in many ways. We have a healthy skepticism here at home. The Danes - we have progressed! Not least because of this, the combination of a secular western people's government like ours and Islam so difficult. An almost insurmountable problem. But we deal with problems. Or challenges as we call them. Even if they seem terribly big. We have suggestions for solutions - I will come back to them.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Since we met a year ago, quite a lot has happened. The narrow Liberal government has become the VLAK government. Ultimate demands for top tax reductions have been replaced by seats in ministerial cars. The Danish People's Party has gained an even greater role. We can now alone majority with the government. But we can also in many situations choose to create a majority outside the government when we find it necessary. Having more paths to take gives greater influence. Therefore, in the situation last year, it was good that the Liberals expanded the government with LA and K. It certainly hasn't made life harder for us. But it hasn't made life harder for us either, that the Social Democratic Party with Mette Frederiksen at the helm has chosen to replace previous hate campaigns against DF with an outstretched hand for cooperation. That hand we have accepted. And since the Social Democratic Party is holding a congress in Aalborg at the same time as our annual meeting here in Herning, I think we should send a greeting north. With the hope that the Social Democratic Party's hinterland will support their party leadership's change of course regarding immigration policy and thus cooperate with us. I read at one point that the party had given Henrik Sass Larsen a ""roaring ban"". But quite frankly: Dear Social Democrats. If you want to show that you have taken the full step, then let Henrik Sass roar at the top of his lungs blow out! And then one more thing... Because there is one more party that is holding a national meeting this weekend. The wing party The Radical Left. This party stands together with Alternativet and Enhedslisten for everything that the previously mentioned Uffe √òstergaard has abandoned. About the multi-cultural, the multi-religious. In reality, about everything that breaks down the community and the cohesion that we care about in our country. If I could get Aladdin's lamp - if I could get the spirit of the lamp out and grant me one wish. Yes - then it would be that the Social Democrats guarantee this weekend from Aalborg that the radicals in Nyborg will have absolutely no influence on immigration policy in the future. Guarantees that regardless of whether the so-called red bloc wins a forthcoming general election, the radicals, Alternativet, Enhedslisten will have no influence on immigration policy. Because just as I do not think that the last mandate of the Liberal Alliance should dictate tax policy, I also do not think that it the last mandate of the radicals or of the Alternative must dictate the immigration policy. On the contrary, I think that the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Danish People's Party across the blocs must guarantee the Danes that from now on immigration will be kept under control. That we will not let it go wrong again. That it is now the border guards who have taken power - and that the border guards have been given time off. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- We are busy. There are a lot of things we have to manage! We have, among other things, witnessed completely absurd situations in Copenhagen in particular. Innocents have been shot. Hard-boiled criminals have completely disregarded all Danish rules and norms. The police have had to advise young people to stay indoors to avoid being hit. The gangs have been wreaking havoc. One of these gangs is the so-called Loyal to Familia. The leader is Pakistani. His name is Shuaib Khan. He is not a Danish citizen - and he has been in prison several times. Among other things for fatal violence against a man in Jomfru Ane Gade in Aalborg. The 21-year-old man received 14 deep stab wounds, as well as being kicked and beaten with broken bottles, chairs and fists. He died from it. Shuaib Khan, together with a group of others, received a sentence for the death penalty, Shuaib Khan was released on parole after only four years. He has not been deported from Denmark! What do you think we should put up with such a man? Don't you just think that he should be thrown out of our country? I mean it! Next, we must have closed the gangs that cause violence and insecurity. Loyal to familia, Brothas, Black Army and whatever else they are all called. Their only purpose is violence, drug dealing, extortion and everything else that we cannot or must accept here in Denmark. That it has also just come to light that 63 percent of the gang members who per.1. May 2017 was registered in the police's special gang register, received cash assistance during 2016, alongside their crime, is absolutely wrong. But don't we have our good, old constitution to stop such things! You would think so. Section 78 of the Basic Law says precisely that associations that work through violence can be banned. Then we wouldn't see to start. No more words about iron fists and zero tolerance. Shut down those gangs! They have done that in several places in Germany. With good results as a result. This must also happen here in Denmark! And then the gangs have to take the case to the courts afterwards if they want to try to get the ban lifted again. But a ban gives the police more powers to stop the gangs' rampage. And our task is to ensure the security of the Danes. So it's just a matter of getting started. We must have created a state of law where it is possible to send criminals like Levakovic and Shuaib Khan out of Denmark. We must decide for ourselves how many and which migrants we want to enter our country. We must make sure that potential terrorists are denied citizenship in Denmark. Exactly these examples show areas where there is still a majority in the Folketing to put the conventions above common sense. One has to ask himself: Have the conventions kept up with the times? Or do the conventions ‚Äì as they are interpreted today ‚Äì prevent common sense from taking place. The answer is self-evident... The conventions are precisely to blame for the fact that Levakovic, who has 28 convictions behind him and who also has never contributed positively to Danish society, has not smoked on a plane home to Croatia for a long time. We can thank the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights for that. The same convention that protects Shuaib Khan from smoking home to Pakistan. in that a Syrian refugee could have the family reunification of his ‚Äì hold on tight ‚Äì 17 children, whom he has with three different wives. The interpretation of conventions was also the reason why a majority in the Danish Parliament in 2014 granted citizenship to a foreigner, even though the person concerned The police's intelligence service was assessed to be a danger to Denmark's security. As recently as this summer, the Supreme Court assessed that the European Convention on Human Rights prevented a group of Romanians from being sent home for prosecution in a case of serious human trafficking. The Supreme Court assessed , that if they were found guilty - GUILTY - they would have a room in prison that would be too small in relation to their human rights. Therefore, these people may not now be held accountable for their deeds in Romania. But we hang on them here in Denmark. Completely absurd! I am getting tired of the fact that criminal foreigners can seek shelter behind international conventions. That simply cannot have been the intention of the conventions. That is why we must keep the government on its promise to seek the conventions changed. But also make it clear that if this cannot be done, then Denmark must be prepared to challenge the conventions - and if that is not enough, then make reservations for the parts of the conventions that prevent us from expelling criminal aliens of the country. We no longer want to be laughed at for our own money.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The people we allow into our country must want to be a positive contribution to Denmark. People we would like to see come. People who come with an honest heart to contribute - not to undermine our country. Such people - whether it is to work or as tourists, must be warmly welcomed. And don't the populations of most countries think like that? I think so! But to ensure that, of course, you have to have control at your borders. At the front door. Control at a country's borders is natural. It is Schengen's borderless Europe that is unnatural .I really find it difficult to understand why it should be a discussion whether to guard one's border or not. Regardless of whether one day the EU should succeed in getting control of the EU's external borders - and I doubt that it ever will happen - then we want to take the view that Denmark must guard its border. Friendly, but firm. Open to the good guests, closed to those we don't want in. So therefore to the rest of the Parliament: Don't leave it to a Greek EU Commissioner to decide whether Denmark must have border control. Let's state that border control is here to stay. Now let's get that border control expanded and made permanent!_ One of our slogans is: There is so much we have to watch out! I think that fits so well with what it's all about. We have so much we want to watch out for. And there are so many dangers out there that we have to watch out for! What do you think if I mention‚Ä¶ Paris Copenhagen Brussels Nice Berlin Stockholm Manchester Barcelona London Yes ‚Äì You have probably guessed it. Cities in Europe where Islamic terrorists have committed terrorist attacks. We have a hard time dealing with how to react when once again are told that terrorists have mowed down a crowd with a truck, or stabbed innocent bystanders with knives, or as we saw yesterday, tried to detonate a bomb on the London Underground. We HAVE to open our eyes to this one new world and the enemy who wants us to die. We must recognize that many of the terrorists are people who grew up in the countries themselves. Perhaps they got inspiration from outside but also got a hatred for the country they grew up in, which can cause them to commit terrorism. Therefore we will have to ask: What do Muslim children learn at the Muslim free schools? against the infidels? When it is necessary to have a quarter of the Muslim free schools under strict supervision. Should our free mind accommodate such schools? Or is it too naive to let it stand. I mean the latter! Or when we hear about mosques that invite preachers of hate on the pulpits who call for violence, killing and stoning. Where you do not want to distance yourself from Islamic State - where you pay tribute to terrorists, as we have seen in, for example, the Grimh√∏j Mosque in Aarhus. No. We must not be naive. Take the money away them. Stress them so that it is difficult for them to recruit more fanatics. It is completely crazy that we spend taxpayers' money on schools that teach jihad and on mosques that preach hate right here in the middle of our own Denmark. We must speak up. We have to say stop. And for those who don't like the smell in the bakery here - then go to your like-minded people in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East. But don't destroy our young people with your twisted medieval nonsense.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî - One of the really big political issues in these years is called Brexit. On 23 June 2016, the British voted for continued membership of the EU. There was a majority in favor of ""Leave"" - ‚Äã‚Äãto make Britain independent again. Great Britain is an important ally for Denmark. Our soldiers are some of those who work most closely together in international missions. The British and the Danes have been close for generations. It was British Field Marshal Montgomery who issued the legendary announcement that the German troops in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark had surrendered. Who doesn't remember that particular scene from Matador? The one where bank director Varn√¶s surprises the fine company by tearing down the hated blackout curtains after they have heard the wonderful news over the radio from England? Fantastic. The British are our friends. The British are our allies. The British are our close trading partners. They should be in the future as well. But the next few years will be decisive in terms of how the close bond can be maintained. The question the British asked themselves in their referendum on 23 June 2016, was basically whether they saw the EU as part of the solution or as part of the problem. The answer was that the EU was mostly part of the problem. I understand the British answer. The EU has, for example, asked the member states to remove their border controls under the pretext that the so-called external borders were under control. But the truth is that the external borders will never be controlled. When you saw the outcry when Hungary actually wanted to enforce its border, you know that the political will is not present. The EU has adopted a forced distribution of up to 120,000 migrants. Although Hungary and Slovenia have tried to have the decision overturned at the European Court of Justice, it has been established that the EU has the right to require migrants to be forcibly distributed to certain countries in the EU. After this judgment, haven't many Danes been confirmed that it is good that we have the reservation of rights? It is precisely this reservation that means that the EU cannot force these migrants to Denmark! But the thinking itself in this forced placement is absurd. And of course undermines the countries' sovereignty quite violently. And then the German Chancellor Merkel showed in autumn 2015 that in the EU it is the right of the strongest. When Germany wants, our common rules are irrelevant. Because then Merkel agreed that 1 million people could migrate up through Europe, which at this time was without internal border controls, she looked big on the common rules, which is otherwise the main argument that the EU is especially good for small countries. With these examples - and many more could be mentioned - it is completely understandable that the UK has had enough. Now it is about how to make a good agreement between the EU and the UK. A good agreement is an agreement where both parties stand as winners .Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Brussels for the British to come out badly. That there must be a penalty in opting out of the EU. This is completely unsympathetic. Perhaps for Brussels it is also about being afraid of , that a good agreement ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãalso for the British ‚Äì will make others (Denmark) see possibilities for a new association with the EU? members to by using fear and threats about all the terrible things that will happen if you don't want to join in. The EU must not look like one of the rock gangs that ravage our streets in that respect. So we will insist that work is being done loyally and dutifully to make a good agreement for the British and for the EU - including Denmark. And what is a good agreement? The most important thing is free trade. That our companies can sell goods as freely as possible in the other countries. Denmark has a colossal interest in having free market access ‚Äì also to Great Britain. Just think of our entire food cluster. It is an old truth that if you want the best Danish bacon, you have to go to England. set it aside. But why is free trade between Denmark and Great Britain threatened? Between the EU and Great Britain threatened? Simply for one reason only: Namely that the EU has set as a requirement for free trade that Great Britain accepts continued free immigration from, for example, the Eastern European countries. is a hoot! When you have followed the British debate, you know that this is exactly where the British must regain full control. On the issue of immigration! The British are simply so tired of being able to move around in large parts of, among other things, London and having endless difficulty finding a Brit. I was in London the day former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died. There were extra editions of the newspapers, which were distributed around that afternoon. TV broadcast extras. It was really big. But most of the people I met on my way were Eastern Europeans. So when I asked what they thought about the death, which was all over the front of the newspapers, everywhere on TV, they replied that they had never heard of it the lady. They simply didn't know who she was and many of them were also numbingly indifferent. That doesn't make them bad people. But it destroys the cohesion of a country when there is no shared history. Shared memory. So the British want control immigration. And I ask: Is it in our interest ‚Äì is it in Denmark's interest that the British are kept as much as possible in the internal market with free trade ‚Äì and in return get full rights to control immigration to their country? The answer is quite simple. Of course it is! But is that the position of the Danish government in the EU? No. And exactly here I would like to make a request to Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. Make it clear to the other countries in the EU that we want a new negotiating line from the EU's side. That we want the EU to tell the British that if they stay in our free trade area, they will of course decide on immigration themselves. This is the only logical thing! Because why should the condition that you can trade with each other at the same time be that Roma can travel freely to beg and create insecurity. Or that you are obliged to send child benefits to children in Romania and Poland. Children who may never have set foot in the country that has to pay the bill. Why do we have to put up with migrant workers undermining the conditions on our labor market. Why do we have to put up with wage suppression and worse working conditions - in order to be able to trade with each other? Of course we don't have to either. The EU's rules have distanced themselves from common sense .It must be changed. And let's use the Brexit negotiations to ensure just that!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì By the way, it is worrying to watch the coverage of Brexit in the media. Great Britain is a democracy. They have had a referendum. Their politicians then discusses what is wise for them to do. Is it healthy? Yes ‚Äì one would think so. But when it is transmitted back home to Denmark by DR and TV2 and the written press, it always turns out that in Great Britain is chaos. That they don't know what they want. That there is political arm-twisting that is tearing the country apart. Negative negative negative. And all stories are turned around so that it seems like doomsday. If a survey shows that 30-35 percent are considering leaving the UK over the coming years, it will be people fleeing because of Brexit. Nevermind that 65-70 percent won't. Or an assessment that there are people coming and going all the time, why the number may be close to what it usually is. And their economy is in tatters, we must understand! If it is an expression of the press that is also in Great Britain, it is particularly interesting that many measurements show that the majority for Brexit is intact. Conversely with the media's coverage of the EU's negotiating position. References are made as if it were the EU's own press department that briefed. And usually we are simply told that such and such is the EU's position. No critical questions about why. Or whether the EU's position is reasonable! The completely deadlocked connection of the question of whether one must accept free immigration in order to be part of the free trade area was, for example, established in the EU at a meeting just a few days after the British referendum in June 2016. that's in place! But no journalists in the major national media have asked critical questions about it. It's just been interpreted as a fact. So the highly critical journalism is wild and bloody when it comes to the coverage in London. But it disappears completely in the mists when it comes to Brussels. This is not just sad. It is harmful to our democracy. So, dear journalists. Can we make an agreement? Before the next annual meeting, you must promise to ask just one critical question to Brussels, for every time you doing 5 critical features from London. Think - could we just get there... ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- It has become autumn in Denmark. And autumn has obviously become synonymous with discussions about tax. Now it is at least the second year in a row, that we must put our hands on the tax policy. The course is chalked up. The government has played out with big plans. Both in relation to tax, business and financial law. The coming two months will show what a majority can be made for. And let me just hit fixed: In DF, we have nothing against the Danes keeping more of their money in their own pockets. But we have two crucial prerequisites for this to be possible. The first is that there is sufficient money in our common coffers to the challenges we have ahead of us. The second is that there is a reasonableness between top and bottom. We lack hands in our elderly care. In the future, there will be more elderly people. Also more elderly people who manage themselves. It is absolutely only positive. But there are also more elderly people - including those with dementia who need help and care. Only people with their hearts in the right place can provide it. And that requires resources. So we know that we must prioritize the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly more than we do today. No one should tremble at the thought of a care home where you have to spend the night on the floor if you have fallen out of bed. Or fear sitting forgotten on the toilet for hours or not having a shower, as you have otherwise been used to. We must ensure dignity for our elderly. Our healthcare system runs on the pumps in many places. In Denmark, we have thousands of super-skilled doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and all the other groups we have on our hospitals, doctors' offices, etc. But for many years we have also demanded that they run stronger. For over 15 years we have had a so-called productivity requirement - in the past many years of 2 percent per year. The hospitals have delivered. Thank you for that .This has meant, among other things, that we do not talk about waiting lists at all today, as we did years ago. But we now say clearly that time has run out from the rigid demand for increased productivity, as it has been formulated. It is working our staff down. It's no longer the right way to do it. That's why we want it gone! And the sooner the better. There are plenty of people in the health care system who have been shouting guard for a long time. The most recent was a professor and senior physician Liselotte H√∏jgaard, head of clinic at Rigshospitalet. In a new debate book, she makes a harsh criticism of the conditions in the healthcare system. ""The system is chronically ill and lies in a bed in intensive care because someone is standing on the oxygen tube,"" she says. We needs committed employees in the healthcare system. And therefore we must take the concerns of the healthcare staff seriously and show them that we are both listening and acting. In the same way, we have a police force that is pushed to the limit. More and more tasks - but not more officers. The resources have been prioritized for people at the desks, but to that extent there is also a need for skilled visible police officers on the streets throughout the country. We saw the need early on. Actually went to the polls in 2015 on a plan for a net 2,000 more officers over the following 10 years. And it is going the right way with training more officers, but it takes time. Most recently, we have trained first team of police cadets, who must relieve the police, e.g. at the border. Unfortunately, a dispute over their terms of employment has meant that they are not functioning yet. A strong call from here to get this resolved quickly. Decisive for many of the right good people, we have in care for the elderly, in the hospitals, the police don't know whether they think it's too busy right now. It's whether there is a perspective of better conditions. More resources. Whether people really listen from the political side .But if there is no money left, when tax cuts have been given, the hope for better conditions disappears. Then the solid - capable - people will lose courage. Then they will find other places to work. And then we will find it even more difficult to deliver a proper welfare society. That must not happen. That is why there must be money in the coffers to strengthen our welfare society when the autumn agreements have been concluded.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì And when we talk about taxes. Then we also talk about top and bottom. About people who earn a lot of money and people with low incomes. The government got off a bit wrong with the director and the HK on minimum wage. They based the calculations on the fact that a director and a HK had the same expenditure on housing. And what was their plan for greatest benefit for the HK. I wonder if we have become wiser there? But that followed on the heels of a statement from Anders Samuelsen that the government had now dropped top tax relief. Because people in the government had read that it was probably not right what we thought was highest on the list of wishes. But when the proposal came, it was with a proposal to remove the so-called ceiling on the employment deduction. It may sound a bit dry. But whoa: Doesn't it have exactly the same effect as reducing The top tax? Yes. The proposal means that a very large proportion of the tax relief will be given to precisely those who earn the most. And the higher the income ‚Äì the higher the relief. One must quietly ask our friends in the government: Don't you think your policy will be discovered?

54608.0," And in the strongly hierarchically divided Swedish society, the official policy of the power elite is not discussed. Although in the parliamentary elections in September 2010 the anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, managed to get into the Riksdag, today it is frozen out by the other parties to such an extent that the bourgeois government votes against its own proposals if it turns out that a a majority can only be obtained with the help of the votes of the Sweden Democrats. A few weeks ago, Weekendavisen could carry a longer story about Sweden's rapid change. Since August 2004, the population has increased by half a million, which is primarily due to family reunifications. The composition of the population changes at the same time. A large part of the increase in population is due to immigration from non-Western countries such as Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. But Sweden's change has never been a matter for the Swedish population. It has never been asked. It has never expressed itself. Any criticism of immigration has amounted to social and career suicide. As recently as the parliamentary elections in 2006, the state media had an obligation to use the word <U+0094>xenophobic<U+0094> in connection with mention of the Sweden Democrats. Today, the Swedes have to live with their changed society. Sweden's third largest city, Malm√∂, a stone's throw from Denmark, constitutes one of Sweden's biggest social and ethnic experiments. Here, every fourth citizen was born in countries other than Sweden, and the district of Roseng√•rd is perhaps the first real parallel society with its own rules and laws in Scandinavia. The Muslim imams have more to say here than the Swedish authorities. The multicultural experiment has a number of inappropriate consequences, which particularly affect ordinary Swedes. Malm√∂ is one of Sweden's <U+0096> and Scandinavia's <U+0096> most criminal cities, where theft, violence, rape and murder are the order of the day. Last fall and early spring, the city was on everyone's lips as a result of a series of murders committed in the city's rapidly growing criminal milieu. But crime is not the only price of multiculturalism <U+0096> ethnic hatred and real <U+0094>racism<U+0094> is another. During the Occupation, neutral Sweden provided a safe haven for several thousand Danish Jews, who were thus saved from destruction in the Nazi death camps. Sweden was the land of freedom. Today, the cry <U+0094>j√§vla jude<U+0094> or the Arabic <U+0094>yahoud<U+0094> rings through the streets of Malm√∂, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Vienna advises Jews to walk in a large arc outside Malm√∂, where even the mayor, Ilmar Reepalu, is described as a problem because he forbade the audience access to a tennis match against Israel, as according to him this could cause unrest in the city. Yes, even President Obama has expressed concerns about the conditions in Malm√∂. The Swedes recently got another exotic taste of what goes on in the parallel society, when it turned out that six out of ten imams answered for hidden camera that a wife does not have the right to deny her husband sex, and that nine out of ten ten imams believed that polygamy is okay under certain circumstances. The answers were of course completely different when Swedish TV officially asked for the imams' opinions. This double standard reminds me of a similar study of Swedish politicians a few years ago. Here, recognized Swedish politicians referred to Muslim immigrants behind a hidden camera with the worst expressions in the language. When they were subsequently confronted about the recordings, they denied everything. The lie has become a permanent part of the Swedish <U+0094>experiment<U+0094>. While official Sweden refuses to listen to the concerns of the Swedes, and while the Swedes remain silent for fear of social reprisals, the undergrowth of violent Nazi and racist movements flourishes. The Malm√∏skytten, whose case is currently winding up in court, is one of the extreme examples. In Sweden, much of the criticism of immigration is left to neo-Nazis. Here is the vent for the frustrations. Sweden's multiculturalism is an artificial backdrop. While official Sweden tries with fanatical zeal to maintain the appearance of goodness and to appear as a role model for the rest of the world, it ferments and seethes underground. The official Sweden is threatened from several sides: among parts of the Muslim immigrants, Islamism and a medieval way of life are a reality, and for a growing number of Swedes the extremist movements are the last refuge. Sweden started the multicultural experiment to show the whole world that a small Scandinavian country could be a refuge for all the persecuted. Sweden would be a model. Today, parts of the country have changed beyond recognition. The highest price has been that lies and pretense have become an integral part of the Swedish mentality.

54500.0," THERE ARE VERY weighty arguments in favor of foreign religious communities in Denmark having the right to practice their rituals exactly as they are practiced in their home country. The most important is of course section 67 of the Constitution. It states that everyone has the right to be blessed in their own faith. However, the Constitution also comes with a limitation: As long as it does not conflict with morality or public order. What exactly goes against morality is not well known. But if you theoretically imagined a religion that turned Christianity upside down, so that it preached hatred and revenge until the end of the world, it probably gives a very good idea. What goes against public order is easier: You must not preach rebellion, revolution or civil war. If you do that, you are no longer protected by section 67 of the Constitution. But it also goes against the principle of reciprocity if you meet foreigners in Denmark with a prohibition against carrying out their religious rituals as they are carried out at home. Because over the years, quite a few Danes abroad have benefited from the fact that there was a branch of the folk church nearby. A COMPLETELY COMMON PRINCIPLE says that the benefits you would like to enjoy yourself, you should also confess to others. If, in principle, you want to join the Danish church in London or Paris, you should therefore also admit to people from London or Paris that they can come to a branch of their church in Copenhagen and elsewhere. It is only fair and reasonable. On the other hand, I must be honest and say that I find it annoying when high-ranking Danish clergy pretend that they are unaware of the fundamental problem that has created a huge dilemma for Danish politicians when it comes to foreign preaching in Denmark. For example, try reading this text sample: ""As a community, today it is our task to keep alive the memory of our honored martyrs, who left us our homeland as a legacy. Those who want to destroy our kinship, our unity and our agreement must never be given any opportunity to sow discord, unrest and strife between us.‚Äù Or this: ‚ÄúNo one who enters Paradise would want to return to Earth. Only a martyr would want to go back and die the martyr's death again when he sees what reputation and what rank he enjoys here in Paradise. It was this message of joy which inspired our Prophet and his followers and later also our forefathers and drove them from one front to the next to achieve this high rank. Into the path of Allah to spread His name.

But that is not the case. Both quotations are excerpts from sermons written by Ditib. That is, the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs. Ditib belongs to the official Turkish state body for religion called the Diyanet. Each and every week, Ditib officials prepare official sermons delivered by imams sent all over Europe. And as you can see from the two excerpts, which are not unusual: Eternal Turkish unity is preached here. That is to say: It is preached that one should never assimilate and fit in with the local population. Just as it is preached that the highest rank in Paradise goes to the martyr who falls at the front in the fight for Islam. THESE ARE TOUGH MATTERS. And what's more: We can't do anything about it. For the Turkish imams reside in, for example, Denmark as a result of an agreement between the EC ‚Äì the then EU ‚Äì and Turkey concluded in 1963: the so-called Ankara agreement. I honestly don't think it suits Danish clergy to play dumb and pretend that the government has a particular problem with heartfelt thoughts about life and death being presented at foreign church services around Denmark. There is simply no one in the Folketing who has that. And therefore it is straw man argumentation of the heaviest caliber to present things in that way.

But if you theoretically imagined a religion that turned Christianity upside down, so that it preached hatred and revenge until the end of the world, it probably gives a very good idea. What goes against public order is easier: You must not preach rebellion, revolution or civil war. If you do that, you are no longer protected by section 67 of the Constitution. But it also goes against the principle of reciprocity if you meet foreigners in Denmark with a prohibition against carrying out their religious rituals as they are carried out at home. Because over the years, quite a few Danes abroad have benefited from the fact that there was a branch of the folk church nearby. A COMPLETELY COMMON PRINCIPLE says that the benefits you would like to enjoy yourself, you should also confess to others. If, in principle, you want to join the Danish church in London or Paris, you should therefore also admit to people from London or Paris that they can come to a branch of their church in Copenhagen and elsewhere. It is only fair and reasonable. On the other hand, I must be honest and say that I find it annoying when high-ranking Danish clergy pretend that they are unaware of the fundamental problem that has created a huge dilemma for Danish politicians when it comes to foreign preaching in Denmark. For example, try reading this text sample: ""As a community, today it is our task to keep alive the memory of our honored martyrs, who left us our homeland as a legacy. Those who want to destroy our kinship, our unity and our agreement must never be given any opportunity to sow discord, unrest and strife between us.‚Äù Or this: ‚ÄúNo one who enters Paradise would want to return to Earth. Only a martyr would want to go back and die the martyr's death again when he sees what reputation and what rank he enjoys here in Paradise. It was this message of joy which inspired our Prophet and his followers and later also our forefathers and drove them from one front to the next to achieve this high rank. Into the path of Allah to spread His name. For the country and its people.‚Äù ONE COULD WELL IMAGINE that these scraps of text were intercepted by some intelligence service, with proper warrants, monitoring a revolutionary, Islamist cell in Molenbeek or some other shady suburb of a Western European city of millions. But that is not the case. Both quotations are excerpts from sermons written by Ditib. That is, the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs. Ditib belongs to the official Turkish state body for religion called the Diyanet. Each and every week, Ditib officials prepare official sermons delivered by imams sent all over Europe. And as you can see from the two excerpts, which are not unusual: Eternal Turkish unity is preached here. That is to say: It is preached that one should never assimilate and fit in with the local population. Just as it is preached that the highest rank in Paradise goes to the martyr who falls at the front in the fight for Islam. THESE ARE TOUGH MATTERS. And what's more: We can't do anything about it. For the Turkish imams reside in, for example, Denmark as a result of an agreement between the EC ‚Äì the then EU ‚Äì and Turkey concluded in 1963: the so-called Ankara agreement. I honestly don't think it suits Danish clergy to play dumb and pretend that the government has a particular problem with heartfelt thoughts about life and death being presented at foreign church services around Denmark. There is simply no one in the Folketing who has that. And therefore it is straw man argumentation of the heaviest caliber to present things in that way. I have not decided myself what the best solution is. But I can assure you that there is a problem: that the Turkish state - with the blessing of a foolish treaty - is spreading its nationalist and fundamentalist agitation and indoctrination all over Europe week after week. Whatever the solution, this is the problem. Not that anyone preaches the word of their god in languages ‚Äã‚Äãother than Danish. Debate article published in Kristeligt Dagblad on 19 December 2020.

56782.0," If Denmark joins an EU patent court, it will provide less democratic control and deteriorate the conditions for innovation. - An EU patent court will remove the democratic and legal security options we have today, where we can go to Danish courts or change the patent legislation in the Folketing. That is why Enhedslisten votes against Danish accession to the EU patent court, says EU rapporteur Nikolaj Villumsen. He recommends the Danes do the same when the proposal comes to a referendum. Free software development in danger There is cause for concern especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsoftware. - We has already seen the EU Patent Office challenge the law preventing the granting of software patents in thousands of cases. We fear that in the future there will be a slide in the area via the EU patent court, says Nikolaj Villumsen. - In that case, it will destroy free and open development in the software area. We have tried to get the minister to guarantee that this will not happen, but in vain. Small businesses can find themselves in trouble Small businesses in particular can find it difficult under a common EU patent court. Small businesses will of course also have the opportunity to apply for a EU patent and can save resources by not having to apply for a patent in the individual member states, interjects Nikolaj Villumsen. - But a joint EU patent court also makes it easier for foreign companies to conduct patent infringement cases. It will impair small companies' opportunities for innovation, because cases at the EU Patent Court are conducted far from Denmark in Greek, German or French. On those terms, only large companies can participate.

53683.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter ‚Äì Monday 17 June 2019. Last Saturday I gave a party leader's speech at the people's meeting on Bornholm. I covered several important things in the speech. Denmark in balance, the climate debate ‚Äì but most importantly I also said a few words about the ongoing government negotiations between the Social Democrats and its supporting parties. It is crucial that Mette Frederiksen holds firm when Morten √òstergaard rolls out and demands concessions for foreigners. But can she? We have an infinite amount to fight for. Our Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãare threatened by Islamization. And with De Radikale in a decisive position, I fear for Denmark's future. Read more in my speech below. Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech at Folkem√∏det Bornholm. 2019. Today is a very special day. Our flag - Dannebrog turns 800 years old. Fallen down by Tallinn, Estonia. Gave the Danes strength. Like when we play football. Roligans paint flags on their faces. Or at the many gymnastics displays where the flags are carried in. At birthdays ‚Äì in the cake. Everywhere!! We use our flag actively. It does happy. we can't agree that we don't require a measurement of the total climate footprint from the Folkem√∏det. Because then it might be that there are some who will have an explanation problem. And we don't want to spoil a good party - do we? Because that every year it's fantastic to come here to Bornholm. Go around and say hello. Have all this small talk at the stands - on the pavement. And I also think that it does a lot of good for Bornholm that the opinion makers, the politicians, the lobbyists take the road over. Perhaps some of the problems many Bornholmers feel in their daily lives are suddenly taken more seriously when they are also experienced by the decision-makers themselves? I could understand that many people had a good ride on the ferry the other day. That many got seasick and looked far ahead the bag that is good to sit with.... And it is a problem that many people on Bornholm have complained about - but it could be that now that commentators, journalists, politicians from other parts of the country have experienced , how a ferry without a stabilizer behaves in the Baltic Sea, that there will be a slide in the case? Let's cross our fingers for that! It is important that we make it attractive to live on our islands as well. Since 2016, the population has increased by our islands. Traffic equality, where it has become cheaper to sail back and forth, has had a positive effect. But the development must be maintained. And therefore the traffic equality of the islands should be fully implemented. I will come back to it with a Denmark in balance .First of all: Maybe some have noticed that we had a general election a week and a half ago. And let me just say it like it is. The Danish People's Party had a lousy election. We take that on ourselves. But to those of our opponents who right now, I want to say: Don't rejoice too soon! We are very much alive. And we are ready for the political battle. Come on! Because I have wondered since the election whether we have actually lost or actually won. After all, a political party cannot be an end in itself. Rather, it is the policy that one believes is the right one for the fatherland. In the best of all worlds, our party is redundant because the other parties have become convinced that they must lead our policy. And when it comes to the combination of a strict immigration policy combined with a proper welfare policy, it must be said that the election this time offered more opportunities. they a welfare promise of DKK 69 billion until 2025. In 2015 the Liberals went to the polls on zero border controls. This time Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen stood at Krus√• together with Inger St√∏jberg to promise that border controls will continue. In 2015, the Social Democrats went to the polls with the radicals on a lax immigration policy. This time they gave a promise to continue our immigration policy - regardless of the fact that they are surrounded by parties that want the exact opposite. In 2015, the Social Democrats had just made both top tax cuts and corporate tax cuts .This time they promise gold and green forests to all public servants - paid almost without tax increases. Shown only 50 √∏re on a new bulb for the car's headlight. So in reality the parties have claimed that they are broadly prepared to ensure the implementation of our politics. And are we necessary at all? After all, we have a statement that says: If you have said A - you must also say B. But right after the election, perhaps it is appropriate to warn against exactly that? A is the party letter for the Social Democrats. B for the radicals. So here is a call to Mette Frederiksen, which I hope penetrates behind the closed doors at Christiansborg! Drop the statement this time. If you have said A ‚Äì you do not also have to say B. Because if you drop this, then we have probably lost mandates at the election. But then we have not necessarily lost politically. Conversely: If you let the statement prevail. Then we must recognize that we have both lost mandates - AND lost politically. But then we can In return, I promise you that we will take the mandates home again! And then back to the flag. To Dannebrog. Because when we can get a little nervous about the other parties, it is also because of their penchant for flags other than Dannebrog. Left have attached to the blue-yellow EU flag. They proudly show that at the culture evening at Christiansborg. Then Dannebrog is hidden away. And even on their socks they like to show off the EU flag rather than Dannebrog. So what happens when The EU decides that there must be an end to border controls? Will Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen stand again at Krus√• with Inger St√∏jberg and say: Not to be discussed? Or will they look at the blue-yellow flag and click their heels together and say yes? I fear the last. And when there is really going to be a party in the Social Democratic Party, they find the bright red ‚Äì that is, the completely red ‚Äì fabric. Without the white cross in the middle. Then international unity is shouted. And then the national fades away. But I really believe , that we must gather around Dannebrog. About the symbol of Denmark and our unique community that it illustrates. And also be aware of what is needed to hold on to the Danish community - the cohesion that we have in it danske. Ensure a balanced Denmark. That you can live the good life everywhere. That DK does not break between the big cities - where growth comes by itself - and then the province. But this requires solidarity from the parts of the country where the economy is booming. Secure a completely new ‚Äì fairer ‚Äì equalization system. Which creates better opportunities for all municipalities to deliver a proper service to the Danes. Where one can ask whether the time has not also come to deal with the discrimination that lies in the municipal tax. The reverse Robin Hood. Where the areas where people earn the most have the lowest municipal tax ‚Äì while the areas where people earn the least have the highest tax. If we want people to settle all over the country, but the tax then increases by 2-3-4 percent, it could well be a drag! Ensure that there are educational opportunities throughout the country. So that our young people get a good start in life. Without having to travel far every day or being forced to largest ‚Äì and most expensive ‚Äì cities. Ensure that you can grow old safely ‚Äì no matter where in the country you live your life. That you do not need to move municipality to be assured of proper care and care ‚Äì or a nursing home place ‚Äì when you need it. In the long run, if we hold on to the special Danishness, it also requires a new balance between the EU and the member states. Greater respect for the national decisions. Because if we empty the countries more and more of political decision-making power, we shift the power away from the citizens. Over to civil servants and bureaucrats. The next fight will of course be the banking union, which many are warming up to enrolling Denmark in. Then Danish taxpayers may be liable for bank crashes in Southern Europe. And why on earth should Danish taxpayers be liable for the fact that in the Southern European countries have been cleaned up after the financial crisis 10-12 years ago? If we are to hold on to the special Danishness in the long term, it also requires that we hold firm in relation to immigration policy. And this actually applies both in relation to asylum and migrants - but also in relation to labor immigration. The number of asylum seekers is now the lowest it has been in over 10 years. It has not come about by itself - but because of political decisions. Which is now in danger of being rolled back. On the other hand, the number of foreigners on the labor market has grown significantly . To the highest number ever. Approximately one in 10 on the labor market today is a foreigner. Over 20 percent in Copenhagen were born abroad. And regardless of whether you come to Denmark to work, such high numbers can of course challenge cohesion. The sense of community .And when some of the foreigners who come also do so with the possibility of years of lower tax payments than the Danes who work with exactly the same, yes ‚Äì then it has a downside in relation to the coherence of Danish society. Of course should we discuss with the business world how we can continue to ensure good conditions for producing in Denmark. We in the Danish People's Party know well who ensures the income for our country. But unlike the individual companies, we also have a responsibility to ensure in the long term the power of cohesion. And the current development challenges the power of cohesion! And we therefore want a Denmark where everyone ‚Äì high or low ‚Äì high-paid or low-paid ‚Äì resident in our big cities or in rural areas ‚Äì can feel like a valued part of the Danish community. fan - around our Dannebrog. Our community must also be secured when we discuss climate. It has become a hot topic. And I would like to emphasize that I fully respect that it is a topic that we must take seriously and that we must recognize people's commitment to the climate. But I also want to make a request: That the climate debate does not become judgmental. That it does not degenerate into people down at the fridge looking over each other's shoulders to see who is presumptuous to buy father's for a mince steak on Saturday evening. That this summer you don't have to stand outside at the airport and point fingers at the families who go on a well-deserved charter holiday away from the stress and hustle and bustle of everyday life. That the people on the platforms in the North Sea, who have secured DKK 400 billion .kr to the state treasury over the past decades, should not suddenly feel misplaced, even if they work in the oil and gas sector. I visited an oil platform here this spring, which was inaugurated by a then-proud Svend Auken. The people out there who work under hard conditions must know that as long as we still need oil and gas, it is better that we collect it in the North Sea than make ourselves more dependent on oil states in the Middle East. Or that it is better that we can help the Germans with gas than they make themselves more dependent on Russia through the so-called North Stream 2. And the same with agriculture. We are a proud agricultural nation. We have a food sector that many other countries envy us. When in the mighty China there is uncertainty about their food, they ask in Denmark if we can help. We are not helping the global climate by dismantling Danish agriculture and the Danish food sector. On the contrary. When negotiations are now underway in Christiansborg about halving Danish pig production, it will not help the global climate. is great for us to simply import more from, for example, Eastern European countries. And then the climate footprint will only get bigger! So my appeal is simply: Bring the nuances into the climate debate. Let's invest in more renewable energy - let's find ways forward help from research - but let's not throw out what we have and are good at with the bathwater. The election campaign is over. Hopefully also the overbids in the climate area. So we can now focus on what works - also globally - instead of only looking at what can make us feel good inside. But back to cohesion. Back to some of the values ‚Äã‚Äãour society is built on. For example gender equality. Where women are not subservient to men. Where women do not have to cover up to keep the honor. Where we can look each other in the eye - have that direct contact. That is why it is not for fun when we have taken up the medieval interpretation of Islam, which orders women to wrap themselves in long robes - scarves and robes, because you come from a culture where the woman has to hide for the sake of honor. For the sake of the family. For the sake of the men. That is why it is not for fun when we have done away with imams in this country who preach about Sharia - about stoning women for adultery. That is why it is not for fun when we want to have ghettos cleared of an immigrant environment that has made areas of our country look more like areas in the Middle East. And therefore it is not at all for funny when it is precisely in these areas that Morten √òstergaard's radical party has achieved its greatest success! On the contrary!! They expect him to now deliver back as a thank you for the votes. That he will roll many of the things that we have done the last few years. It must not happen! So a great responsibility rests on those who are currently sitting and negotiating behind closed doors in Christiansborg. We are watching you! And especially watching whether the Social Democrats keep the promises that have been made to the Danes. After an election campaign where the promises have been many and big! Remember Mette Frederiksen: You said very clearly in the election campaign that you would rather say no to becoming prime minister than relax the immigration policy. That was quite a promise! But you made it !Now you have to keep it! And while we wait for the result, we are enjoying it here on Bornholm. And too bad that we have to wait for a long time. Because even if the general meeting ends soon, thank God we can come back to this lovely island, where I look forward to spending my summer vacation. And apologies to the many visitors: But it will also be nice to be here at a time when there are a little less lobbyists ‚Äì and a little more Bornholmers. cheers for Dannebrog.",no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text critiques immigration policies but does not claim that state institutions irrationally favor a particular group.

That it does not degenerate into people down at the fridge looking over each other's shoulders to see who is presumptuous to buy father's for a mince steak on Saturday evening. That this summer you don't have to stand outside at the airport and point fingers at the families who go on a well-deserved charter holiday away from the stress and hustle and bustle of everyday life. That the people on the platforms in the North Sea, who have secured DKK 400 billion .kr to the state treasury over the past decades, should not suddenly feel misplaced, even if they work in the oil and gas sector. I visited an oil platform here this spring, which was inaugurated by a then-proud Svend Auken. The people out there who work under hard conditions must know that as long as we still need oil and gas, it is better that we collect it in the North Sea than make ourselves more dependent on oil states in the Middle East. Or that it is better that we can help the Germans with gas than they make themselves more dependent on Russia through the so-called North Stream 2. And the same with agriculture. We are a proud agricultural nation. We have a food sector that many other countries envy us. When in the mighty China there is uncertainty about their food, they ask in Denmark if we can help. We are not helping the global climate by dismantling Danish agriculture and the Danish food sector. On the contrary. When negotiations are now underway in Christiansborg about halving Danish pig production, it will not help the global climate. is great for us to simply import more from, for example, Eastern European countries. And then the climate footprint will only get bigger! So my appeal is simply: Bring the nuances into the climate debate. Let's invest in more renewable energy - let's find ways forward help from research - but let's not throw out what we have and are good at with the bathwater. The election campaign is over. Hopefully also the overbids in the climate area. So we can now focus on what works - also globally - instead of only looking at what can make us feel good inside. But back to cohesion. Back to some of the values ‚Äã‚Äãour society is built on. For example gender equality. Where women are not subservient to men. Where women do not have to cover up to keep the honor. Where we can look each other in the eye - have that direct contact. That is why it is not for fun when we have taken up the medieval interpretation of Islam, which orders women to wrap themselves in long robes - scarves and robes, because you come from a culture where the woman has to hide for the sake of honor. For the sake of the family. For the sake of the men. That is why it is not for fun when we have done away with imams in this country who preach about Sharia - about stoning women for adultery. That is why it is not for fun when we want to have ghettos cleared of an immigrant environment that has made areas of our country look more like areas in the Middle East. And therefore it is not at all for funny when it is precisely in these areas that Morten √òstergaard's radical party has achieved its greatest success! On the contrary!! They expect him to now deliver back as a thank you for the votes. That he will roll many of the things that we have done the last few years. It must not happen! So a great responsibility rests on those who are currently sitting and negotiating behind closed doors in Christiansborg. We are watching you! And especially watching whether the Social Democrats keep the promises that have been made to the Danes. After an election campaign where the promises have been many and big! Remember Mette Frederiksen: You said very clearly in the election campaign that you would rather say no to becoming prime minister than relax the immigration policy. That was quite a promise! But you made it !Now you have to keep it! And while we wait for the result, we are enjoying it here on Bornholm. And too bad that we have to wait for a long time. Because even if the general meeting ends soon, thank God we can come back to this lovely island, where I look forward to spending my summer vacation.

53683.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter ‚Äì Monday 17 June 2019. Last Saturday I gave a party leader's speech at the people's meeting on Bornholm. I covered several important things in the speech. Denmark in balance, the climate debate ‚Äì but most importantly I also said a few words about the ongoing government negotiations between the Social Democrats and its supporting parties. It is crucial that Mette Frederiksen holds firm when Morten √òstergaard rolls out and demands concessions for foreigners. But can she? We have an infinite amount to fight for. Our Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãare threatened by Islamization. And with De Radikale in a decisive position, I fear for Denmark's future. Read more in my speech below. Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech at Folkem√∏det Bornholm. 2019. Today is a very special day. Our flag - Dannebrog turns 800 years old. Fallen down by Tallinn, Estonia. Gave the Danes strength. Like when we play football. Roligans paint flags on their faces. Or at the many gymnastics displays where the flags are carried in. At birthdays ‚Äì in the cake. Everywhere!! We use our flag actively. It does happy. we can't agree that we don't require a measurement of the total climate footprint from the Folkem√∏det. Because then it might be that there are some who will have an explanation problem. And we don't want to spoil a good party - do we? Because that every year it's fantastic to come here to Bornholm. Go around and say hello. Have all this small talk at the stands - on the pavement. And I also think that it does a lot of good for Bornholm that the opinion makers, the politicians, the lobbyists take the road over. Perhaps some of the problems many Bornholmers feel in their daily lives are suddenly taken more seriously when they are also experienced by the decision-makers themselves? I could understand that many people had a good ride on the ferry the other day. That many got seasick and looked far ahead the bag that is good to sit with.... And it is a problem that many people on Bornholm have complained about - but it could be that now that commentators, journalists, politicians from other parts of the country have experienced , how a ferry without a stabilizer behaves in the Baltic Sea, that there will be a slide in the case? Let's cross our fingers for that! It is important that we make it attractive to live on our islands as well. Since 2016, the population has increased by our islands. Traffic equality, where it has become cheaper to sail back and forth, has had a positive effect. But the development must be maintained. And therefore the traffic equality of the islands should be fully implemented. I will come back to it with a Denmark in balance .First of all: Maybe some have noticed that we had a general election a week and a half ago. And let me just say it like it is. The Danish People's Party had a lousy election. We take that on ourselves. But to those of our opponents who right now, I want to say: Don't rejoice too soon! We are very much alive. And we are ready for the political battle. Come on! Because I have wondered since the election whether we have actually lost or actually won. After all, a political party cannot be an end in itself. Rather, it is the policy that one believes is the right one for the fatherland. In the best of all worlds, our party is redundant because the other parties have become convinced that they must lead our policy. And when it comes to the combination of a strict immigration policy combined with a proper welfare policy, it must be said that the election this time offered more opportunities. they a welfare promise of DKK 69 billion until 2025. In 2015 the Liberals went to the polls on zero border controls. This time Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen stood at Krus√• together with Inger St√∏jberg to promise that border controls will continue. In 2015, the Social Democrats went to the polls with the radicals on a lax immigration policy. This time they gave a promise to continue our immigration policy - regardless of the fact that they are surrounded by parties that want the exact opposite. In 2015, the Social Democrats had just made both top tax cuts and corporate tax cuts .This time they promise gold and green forests to all public servants - paid almost without tax increases. Shown only 50 √∏re on a new bulb for the car's headlight. So in reality the parties have claimed that they are broadly prepared to ensure the implementation of our politics. And are we necessary at all? After all, we have a statement that says: If you have said A - you must also say B. But right after the election, perhaps it is appropriate to warn against exactly that? A is the party letter for the Social Democrats. B for the radicals. So here is a call to Mette Frederiksen, which I hope penetrates behind the closed doors at Christiansborg! Drop the statement this time. If you have said A ‚Äì you do not also have to say B. Because if you drop this, then we have probably lost mandates at the election. But then we have not necessarily lost politically. Conversely: If you let the statement prevail. Then we must recognize that we have both lost mandates - AND lost politically. But then we can In return, I promise you that we will take the mandates home again! And then back to the flag. To Dannebrog. Because when we can get a little nervous about the other parties, it is also because of their penchant for flags other than Dannebrog. Left have attached to the blue-yellow EU flag. They proudly show that at the culture evening at Christiansborg. Then Dannebrog is hidden away. And even on their socks they like to show off the EU flag rather than Dannebrog. So what happens when The EU decides that there must be an end to border controls? Will Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen stand again at Krus√• with Inger St√∏jberg and say: Not to be discussed? Or will they look at the blue-yellow flag and click their heels together and say yes? I fear the last. And when there is really going to be a party in the Social Democratic Party, they find the bright red ‚Äì that is, the completely red ‚Äì fabric. Without the white cross in the middle. Then international unity is shouted. And then the national fades away. But I really believe , that we must gather around Dannebrog. About the symbol of Denmark and our unique community that it illustrates. And also be aware of what is needed to hold on to the Danish community - the cohesion that we have in it danske. Ensure a balanced Denmark. That you can live the good life everywhere. That DK does not break between the big cities - where growth comes by itself - and then the province. But this requires solidarity from the parts of the country where the economy is booming. Secure a completely new ‚Äì fairer ‚Äì equalization system. Which creates better opportunities for all municipalities to deliver a proper service to the Danes. Where one can ask whether the time has not also come to deal with the discrimination that lies in the municipal tax. The reverse Robin Hood. Where the areas where people earn the most have the lowest municipal tax ‚Äì while the areas where people earn the least have the highest tax. If we want people to settle all over the country, but the tax then increases by 2-3-4 percent, it could well be a drag! Ensure that there are educational opportunities throughout the country. So that our young people get a good start in life. Without having to travel far every day or being forced to largest ‚Äì and most expensive ‚Äì cities. Ensure that you can grow old safely ‚Äì no matter where in the country you live your life. That you do not need to move municipality to be assured of proper care and care ‚Äì or a nursing home place ‚Äì when you need it. In the long run, if we hold on to the special Danishness, it also requires a new balance between the EU and the member states. Greater respect for the national decisions. Because if we empty the countries more and more of political decision-making power, we shift the power away from the citizens. Over to civil servants and bureaucrats. The next fight will of course be the banking union, which many are warming up to enrolling Denmark in. Then Danish taxpayers may be liable for bank crashes in Southern Europe. And why on earth should Danish taxpayers be liable for the fact that in the Southern European countries have been cleaned up after the financial crisis 10-12 years ago? If we are to hold on to the special Danishness in the long term, it also requires that we hold firm in relation to immigration policy. And this actually applies both in relation to asylum and migrants - but also in relation to labor immigration. The number of asylum seekers is now the lowest it has been in over 10 years. It has not come about by itself - but because of political decisions. Which is now in danger of being rolled back. On the other hand, the number of foreigners on the labor market has grown significantly . To the highest number ever. Approximately one in 10 on the labor market today is a foreigner. Over 20 percent in Copenhagen were born abroad. And regardless of whether you come to Denmark to work, such high numbers can of course challenge cohesion. The sense of community .And when some of the foreigners who come also do so with the possibility of years of lower tax payments than the Danes who work with exactly the same, yes ‚Äì then it has a downside in relation to the coherence of Danish society. Of course should we discuss with the business world how we can continue to ensure good conditions for producing in Denmark. We in the Danish People's Party know well who ensures the income for our country. But unlike the individual companies, we also have a responsibility to ensure in the long term the power of cohesion. And the current development challenges the power of cohesion! And we therefore want a Denmark where everyone ‚Äì high or low ‚Äì high-paid or low-paid ‚Äì resident in our big cities or in rural areas ‚Äì can feel like a valued part of the Danish community. fan - around our Dannebrog. Our community must also be secured when we discuss climate. It has become a hot topic. And I would like to emphasize that I fully respect that it is a topic that we must take seriously and that we must recognize people's commitment to the climate. But I also want to make a request: That the climate debate does not become judgmental.

They expect him to now deliver back as a thank you for the votes. That he will roll many of the things that we have done the last few years. It must not happen! So a great responsibility rests on those who are currently sitting and negotiating behind closed doors in Christiansborg. We are watching you! And especially watching whether the Social Democrats keep the promises that have been made to the Danes. After an election campaign where the promises have been many and big! Remember Mette Frederiksen: You said very clearly in the election campaign that you would rather say no to becoming prime minister than relax the immigration policy. That was quite a promise! But you made it !Now you have to keep it! And while we wait for the result, we are enjoying it here on Bornholm. And too bad that we have to wait for a long time. Because even if the general meeting ends soon, thank God we can come back to this lovely island, where I look forward to spending my summer vacation. And apologies to the many visitors: But it will also be nice to be here at a time when there are a little less lobbyists ‚Äì and a little more Bornholmers. cheers for Dannebrog.",no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text contains strong party rhetoric but does not claim that state institutions irrationally favor a particular group.

54472.0," There have always been conflicts. And we have always had a responsibility to help. But with the EU ‚Äì with Chancellor Merkel ‚Äì with the open borders ‚Äì it is as if it is now accepted that people can wander away from the conflicts as they wish. And our society must then just stand ready - pay at the till both in terms of financial resources and subsequently more divided societies. This has a clear consequence: It will be more difficult for us to help in future conflicts! It's a crazy path to tread. More than 18,000 refugees and migrants came to Denmark in 2015. The expectation is that next year there will be 25,000. To this must be added family reunification, which may mean that the number must be multiplied by three. So with potentially 75,000 new citizens next year, it is not difficult to spot the challenges. One thing is the economic consequences. 2.9 billion DKK in expenses for the asylum system, integration programs etc. in 2011 had in 2015 become expenses for DKK 9.2 billion. In addition, all the expenses that the municipalities now say will not be covered at all by the state reimbursement. Should these expenses then be taken from care for the elderly, hospitals, etc.? No - we don't want that! Well - then we have heard that refugees and migrants should be a resource for Danish society. Almost a gift to our labor market. Dansk Industri, among others, has argued for this. But that the migrants should be well-educated is unfortunately a myth. Quite a few can neither read nor write and the few who have actual longer educations often cannot use them directly in Denmark. History also shows that the majority end up receiving lifelong support from the public. But in addition to the major economic challenges, there is also the fact that Syrians, Iraqis and others from the Middle East are very difficult to integrate into Danish society. After four years, for example, less than 20 percent of men are in work, while for women it is as low as five percent. And we know, unfortunately, that the lack of integration means the establishment of parallel societies and less community and cohesion in Danish society. Perhaps the Liberal government and other parties in Christiansborg believe that the solution is simply to allocate more resources to integration. That entry-level wages and the like are introduced in the Danish labor market. That there will be even more friendly residents"", who welcome those who migrate to Denmark. I think, on the contrary, that it is an illusion to think that you can solve the migrations that are happening through integration and the city's welcome. We are at a crossroads. We have to decide whether we are going to do more of the same ‚Äì what hasn't worked ‚Äì or whether we are going to fundamentally change the way we help people in need. Due to the many refugees and migrants coming to Denmark, we now use approx. 30 percent of development aid in this country. It is necessary! Alternatively, savings had to be made on the core welfare in Danish society. But at the same time, it is clear that we could help many people around the world for the money that refugees and migrants now spend in this country. It is in many ways unsustainable. An emergency aid organization said yesterday that they can help, for example, 12,000 people with the basic needs of 1 million. DKK per month! Then you can start calculating yourself how many people we can help for the money we spend on failed integration in this country. We should all be able to agree that refugees must be helped. They are fleeing war and need our help. But we should maintain that it is temporary help and that refugees, as citizens of the countries they have left, play an important role when the countries have to be rebuilt. Refugees who have traveled through five, six or seven countries to get to Denmark have shown both initiative and dynamism. These are two properties which are absolutely crucial when, for example, a country like Syria will one day be rebuilt. In other words, they will be sorely needed at home. In other words, we must give refugees shelter and peace from war and unrest. But we must not give anyone false hope that they can move their family's future to this country. We cannot solve the world's challenges by moving populations like that. We help no one if we destroy our own society in the long run. Destroys community and cohesion in Denmark. The municipalities' difficult situation illustrates the heart of the matter: That it is about prioritizing. Are we willing to put our own well-being in jeopardy because things are just allowed to crumble through our fingers? Or should we <U+0094>reinvent<U+0094> the old concept of refugee and again distinguish between refugees and immigrants. Refugees must have shelter and protection <U+0096> regardless of what they bring with them in terms of education and other qualifications - but for a temporary period. Immigrants must be assessed in relation to what they can contribute to Danish society - but integrated with a view to permanent residence. These are two very different things. In the short term, the municipalities must have support to cope with the problems. But they are not solved by the money being taken from one taxpayer-funded fund to another. Therefore, we need to fundamentally revise our views on refugee and immigrant policy. In recent months, we have adopted significant restrictions in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration in the Danish Parliament. But we are still missing the most important one: That people with refugee status should fundamentally not be integrated into Danish society. They must be helped temporarily. In return, we can help so many more! In this way, we can secure our society for the future at the same time that we help many more people in need around the world. D&eacute is the way forward! - and that will help to ensure Christmas peace...

55449.0," Sympathy and respect must also be given to the police officers who were injured by the terrorist. May they heal quickly in both body and soul. I would also like to say a big thank you to the police, who made a great effort to look after us all and to catch and stop the terrorist and thus the terror. Thanks! People were killed and injured, freedom of speech and the Jewish community were attacked, and Copenhagen was held in an iron grip of fear. It is quite disturbing to experience in Denmark. It is obviously true that we must now stand together and stand firm to preserve our free society based on our values ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc. We must not waver or hesitate when Islamist madmen from, for example, Hizb-ut-Tahrir mean that <U+0094>the western values ‚Äã‚Äãare among the causes of the problem<U+0094> and by the way talk about the <U+0094>West's false values ‚Äã‚Äãand inhuman politics<U+0094>. The responsibility for this weekend's terror rests with the terrorist alone and then with those who helped him or influenced him to commit his bloody and disgusting terror. To think that by changing ourselves a little, we can enter into a compromise with such persons is naive. As I wrote in a weekly letter on January 12 after the tragic terror in France: <U+0094>When it comes to these Islamists, we must and must show strength and toughness. We must and must stand firm. Because they hate our democracy, our equality, our way of life and everything that we stand for. They are numbingly indifferent to any <U+0094>tone of the debate<U+0094> and other finer nuances. That's not what it's about for them at all<U+0094>. In the coming days, calm and overview must be created. The police must get to the bottom of the case, and we must get all the details out. We must, among other things, because it will give us knowledge about how we can better prevent this kind of terrorist attack in the future. Because we must and must learn. Was the terrorist a so-called <U+0094>lone wolf<U+0094> or was he in league with others? This is one of the questions many ask themselves. Regardless of the answer, preventing terrorism is one of the most difficult things. But it is precisely when something is difficult that you have to do your best! It is a challenge and a complicated and large task, I admit that, but we must take it upon ourselves. And when everyday politics returns, the government must also come up with the previously promised update for any shortcomings in the police and intelligence services. Many Danes are naturally confused about reports that officers had to go out with bulletproof vests in the wrong sizes because there is a lack of safety equipment at the Copenhagen Police. The chairman of the Copenhagen Police Association also reports that there is a lack of heavy weapons and training in using them. Of course, that must be looked at! It is not appropriate for the police in a crisis situation to lack equipment or training. After all, terrorists only succeed &eacute once <U+0096> then the tragedy is d&eacute. Police and intelligence services must be on the spot every time to ensure the security of the Danes. Therefore, there should be no doubt that we will provide them with the sufficient tools to do just that. Politically, there is enough to discuss. Why don't we have fixed border controls? Why is more not being done to avoid parallel societies from which extremism can grow? Why is it not ensured that immigration only has a scope that makes it possible to integrate those who come? Why is there not a firm and consistent crackdown on those who fight from within the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat Danish society is based on <U+0096> perhaps after being drawn into a so-called <U+0094>holy war<U+0094>? There are a lot of questions to ask. We will probably ask them in the coming weeks and months. We will not forget that. But we're not asking them today! Today we use the time to reflect and remember. There are two families who are missing one of their loved ones today. Two who were killed over the weekend. Finn N√∏rgaard, who participated in the debate event on freedom of expression in Krudtt√∏nden. Dan Uzan who had once again taken on the role of doorman so that others could hold a festive gathering in the congregation house by the synagogue. Tragic! And policemen who were hit by bullets <U+0096> thank God not fatal <U+0096> but which underlines the seriousness of police work. And a situation that gives rise to us all remembering to appreciate the people who will pull on the uniform to defend the society and the values ‚Äã‚Äãwe stand for.

54507.0,"Pia Kj√¶rsgaard's constitutional speech Sunday 5 June 2011 The weekly newsletter reproduces my constitutional speech, which I gave on Sunday 5 June in the beautiful surroundings of Lykkesholm Castle. As many as 800 supporters of the Danish People's Party turned up to celebrate the 162nd anniversary of the Constitution.-Want to know Has the population not had enough? Election campaign, election campaign. Blue bloc. Red bloc. the next day, of course, people have forgotten what the political commentators said - and COMPLETELY free of charge they can throw a new possible election date through the air. It's like the weather prophets. One promises a cold winter - another says the winter will be warm. of them are usually always right. And you know what - by November at the latest, one of these commentators will also be right - because eventually we MUST have elections. Exactly one year ago in this place, the election campaign was already the main theme. That's how it is been since the elections to the EU Parliament in 2009. In the Danish People's Party, we dare to meet the voters on election day - because we meet them all the time. All over the country. Every day. We don't just hand out brochures or go around Denmark because we think with the election coming tomorrow. No, we do that almost all year round - also outside the election campaigns. In connection with the just concluded negotiations on how to secure future welfare and Danish values, we have also constantly been in close dialogue with our voters. We have laid all the cards on the table ‚Äì ahead of the upcoming election. Our politics are not a lottery ticket. , where also the poet H.C. Andersen had his way. He had that at many manors, by the way, but he described Lykkesholm as ""the most beautiful place in Fyen"". We have come to celebrate the Danish Constitution. .162 years have passed since the fathers of the Constitution drew up this simple and solemn document, which forms the legislative framework around our Danish democracy <U+0096> one of the oldest in Europe. It is a law we should be proud of. Compared with The <U+0094>Lisbon Treaty<U+0094> of the EU bureaucrats, which resembles a telephone book in size but is only half as exciting, the Constitution is a masterpiece <U+0096> built to last for decades , yes, centuries. The constitution has grown out of the people, while the Treaty of Lisbon has been pressed down on the heads of the population. It is the ninth time that we have again chosen to gather for this lovely DF tradition - and I am happy to see that so many of you have chosen to spend the next few hours in our company. I can promise that it won't all be about politics. There is also something good for the palate - and good musical entertainment. Also take the opportunity to take a stroll in the park during the break - it's so beautiful here. Listen to the birds' songs. Maybe even hear the cuckoo's crow over on the other side of the lake! A lot can be said about the Danish People's Party. But you can't blame us for having slept away the spring. Nor can we be accused of lacking the courage to make some decisions, which have not always been easy! That is why it was absolutely crucial for the Danish People's Party to help find the famous DKK 47 billion to future-proof the Danish economy. Could the worn-out now also be sure of receiving back pay? Yes, of course! With the senior early pension scheme, worn-out people can now retire WITHOUT a work trial and other administrative difficulties. You don't even have to be a member of a social security fund to be able to get a senior early pension. This socially fair withdrawal scheme for seniors was actually the condition for the Danish People's Party to participate at all. In addition, the withdrawal scheme must be seen as part of a much larger whole <U+0096> a wide range of good initiatives. I can mention the BoligJobplanen, for example. quite ordinary Danes no longer feel like dangerous criminals because they have to replace a front door or fixtures in the bathroom <U+0096> or they don't have to do dangerous amateur work and be a danger to themselves or their surroundings. No, instead you can now get a deduction for home improvement expenses. And isn't it far more logical that the doctor spends his time treating patients and that the teacher spends time preparing his teaching <U+0096> than that the hunched over run around in an attic and carry out post-insulation or perhaps install a faucet incorrectly? Now it can be left to professionals again. At the same time as it boosts employment in smaller companies. I can also mention that we have ensured that the health sector in the period from 2014- 2020 will be strengthened by between 1.5 and 2 billion kroner annually, and these funds come on top of the five billion extra that was secured in connection with the recovery agreement. This means that we take into account the demographic development in Denmark with more elderly people. Among other things, there is a strengthening of the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases <U+0096>, in addition to which there is a historic investment of DKK 41 billion in better and up-to-date hospitals. In the Danish People's Party, we are proud that we have succeeded to set aside even more funds for treatment <U+0096> it was only possible with the help of the extra financial leeway that the agreements have given us. And what have the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party actually done themselves, while the rest of us sat for weeks at the negotiating table? Yes, they have done nothing but shout from the sidelines. They have done nothing to put their stamp on the agreement. They have done nothing to promote the interests of their constituents. Not a single fingerprint has been left on a agreement for the benefit of the welfare society's future. In my world, politics is about seeking influence. Politics is about maximum influence. This has also been the common thread in the Danish People's Party's policy from the beginning. However, for a brief remark, the Radicals took responsibility. We are disagreed about most things - but at least the radicals participated constructively in the negotiations <U+0096> opposite the Social Democracy. That the radicals then at the same time showed to everyone that they fundamentally do not agree with the Social Democracy or the Socialist People's Party on anything - I certainly won't bemoan that. It will be Helle Thorning-Schmidt's and Villy S√∏vndal's problem if they have to drag around Margrethe Vestager in a future red cabinet. Because they will do that if they get power <U+0096> and I emphasize <U+0096> if <U+0096> they get power. And the radicals always pay dearly. But Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal act like nothing. They say well enough that they want to maintain the strict immigration policy. But at the same time they have also said that they want to get rid of the start-up aid, so that foreigners must have full cash assistance from the first day they receive a residence permit in Denmark. They also want a more relaxed practice in the Immigration Service, and they want to roll back the point system in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfamily reunification .And all of this is probably agreed upon in the opposition. In addition, the demands of De Radikale for wanting to cooperate with S-SF. It is about abolishing the 24-year rule and the attachment requirement, and that Denmark must take in more asylum seekers , and that we must open our border more and make it easier to enter the green card scheme <U+0096> to name just a few of the radical demands. advice. Yes, it will probably be fun. ""Fair Solution"" is mostly based on wild speculation - among other things, a rock-solid belief that a large part of Denmark's problems can be solved if only all Danes work 12 more minutes a day or take a week's less vacation a year. The plan has certainly long since been put in the grave by all economists, because it is underfunded by somewhere between 15 and 20 billion kroner. But the more frayed the plan becomes, the more convulsively the duo Thorning- Schmidt and S√∏vndal take to it like shipwrecked to a raft. Well, it's a shame it's also printed on nice paper - and probably also in so many copies that it's impossible to get rid of it at all. And then you actually have to let the plan &eacuten thing: It is the only truly ORIGINAL thing that has come out of the two parties for years. The plan is theirs - and only theirs. No one else believes it. No one wants it! The plan belongs in the political garbage dump of Danish history. In the absence of real arguments, the Social Democrats and People's Socialists shoot right and left like pure desperadoes. A few days ago, the deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, Nick H√¶kkerup, launched a frontal attack on the country's banks <U +0096> because they don't <U+0094>like<U+0094> the economic plan of the Reds. That's why the banks have suddenly become <U+0094>political<U+0094> because they allow themselves to criticize a plan which every first-year student in economics can see that there is no connection. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party have also announced that there will be major changes in the civil service apparatus. People must understand that you cannot have such <U+0094>reactionaries<U+0094> elements sitting, who for ten years have served a bourgeois government. And not at all, when they don't even bother to dream along with the socialists' thoughts about the miracle medicine <U+0094>Fair solution<U+0094>. That it is about a clear break with Danish traditions <U+0096> because in this country the stable bureaucracy has always been one of the pillars of democracy <U+0096> the socialists don't care about that. Perhaps because they have been so busy copying President Obama, that they also want to copy the entire American system, where everything is replaced after a presidential election. And what about the free press? Yes, socialists have always had a bit of a hard time with freedom of expression <U+0096> there are long traditions for that. And doesn't the former chairman of the Danish Communist Party, Ole Sohn, who in his time cheek-kissed the GDR dictator Erich Honecker, completely agree that the <U+0094>reactionary bourgeois press<U+0094> must be limited in its possibilities of expression , because it slows down the world revolution? Perhaps that was the reason why Henrik Sass Larsen began to resent the bourgeois press. He is so tired of the bourgeois press that he has promised <U+0094>payback-time<U+0094> , if he comes to power. If he could, he would like to cancel the postage subsidy for Berlingske Tidende, he said. Editor-in-chief of Berlingske Tidende, Lisbeth Knudsen, does not understand the criticism. For weeks, she has not seen a reader's letter from Henrik Sass Larsen's hand <U +0096> that's why nothing has been recorded in the newspaper either. It's that simple. The vast majority of debate editors share sun and wind equally <U+0096> and try to present the readers with a versatile debate. How embarrassing! Social democratic <U+0094>cultural struggle<U+0094> to camouflage the obvious lack of real political visions.Social democratic censorship because the population must not hear criticism of <U+0094>the most brilliant plan of the century<U+0094>.And Villy S√∏vndal is not a notch better. Now the man has reached the point that he cannot open his mouth without pouring a bucket of rubbish over the Danish People's Party. This is, of course, something his large collegium of spin doctors has told him to do: <U+0094 >Now listen, Villy <U+0096> you just have to criticize Pia Kj√¶rsgaard and accuse her of breaking her promise if someone asks what SF wants. Then they don't think too much about all the strange things you yourself go around and says, and then the next day you suddenly don't mean anything anymore, because we say you have to mean something else <U+0096> that's brilliant spin, Villy<U+0094>. You can imagine how Villy S√∏vndal backs down thoughtfully on his pipe, and says that <U+0094>it might not be so crazy after all. As soon as I get into government<U+0094>. No, Villy S√∏vndal only means one thing: That which can give him power. one day an attack on Hizb-ut-Tahrir <U+0096> the next day higher punishments for criminals and an adherence to the 24-year rule. Or visits to 20-30-40 nursing homes, Villy S√∏vndal has great difficulty with the truth. The unfortunate is that Villy S√∏vndal's party does not agree with him on very much at all. They tolerate him exactly as long as he tries to get the Socialist People's Party into government. Yes, of course I don't know how you feel. I am only attracted by honesty .The scariest thing, however, is that the voters are cruelly taken for fools. Because I can assure you that Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal do not believe in their own plan either. And so do Henrik Sass Larsen, Morten B√∏dskov and Ole Sohn for not for that matter either - and certainly not the trade union movement. They will then say run and jump to work more. The voters cannot be told what S and SF will do to make ends meet in the Danish economy - because they will have to. After all, the two parties welcomed the EU's budget monitoring. This means that they have to find the money - and that they cannot pursue pure Anker J√∏rgensen politics, even if they wanted to. This means one thing: More taxes and taxes to the Danes. Either in the form of direct taxation of owner-occupied homes <U+0096> nor should we forget here that Enhedslisten also demands influence and would very much like to see increased housing taxation. It is an idea that the radicals LOVE. Ole Sohn admittedly denied it in a famous TV debate with Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen, where Ole Sohn shouted and screamed because Hjort referred to previous statements from Sohn... Or they are simply driving the Danish economy all the way to where the interest rate automatically comes to to increase. This means increased unemployment. This means that many will be leaving home and home. Especially first-time buyers, who can only thank the variable loans for getting a foothold in the housing market. Honestly! Is the choice that difficult? The government and The Danish People's Party has found the DKK 47 billion. There will be no unpleasant surprises - no new creative taxes and fees. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party, on the other hand, twist and turn every single brain cell in the hunt for funding. They talk and talk <U+0096> more than they think !One day a toll ring must be established around Copenhagen, which could end up costing motorists an extra 18,000 per year. The next day tobacco, fat, sweets ‚Äì and spring water at workplaces ‚Äì will be subject to a fire tax. Socialists love to TALK about justice, but have more difficulty exercising it in practice. The rest of us can be happy that we still have freedom of speech <U+0096> and that critical economists can still speak in the so-called <U+0094>bourgeois<U+0094> press .Who knows how long it will last... When did any of you last drive across the border into Germany? Did you notice the guard towers? Did you see the Spanish horsemen with barbed wire? Did you have your car and luggage searched by overzealous customs officials? Denmark is the new fortress in Europe. No one enters here <U+0096> and even those who travel out are thoroughly investigated. No, of course this is pure nonsense and nonsense! But if the hysteria in the EU Commission, in parts of foreign countries and among domestic EU supporters, that is exactly what Denmark has done. We have closed the country <U+0096> so now we can really sit and enjoy ourselves in our allotment garden idyll! Now it is like this with the EU that <U+0094>reality<U+0094> is a foreign word. In the EU, reality is not in high demand. Neither are the nations and the concern for the safety of the population. The EU is only interested in utopias and ideas. In this case, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <U+0094>borderless<U+0094> Europe. It's such a neat idea that if you lift the borders, the nations will eventually disappear too... And that <U+0094>borderless Europe<U+0094> has also had a price. But I am not sure that the family that has been attacked by unscrupulous, Eastern European home robbers shares the dream of a borderless Europe. Nor do I think that the elderly couple that has been emptied by burglars their home - everything they have collected together over a lifetime - shares the EU's utopias. Naturally, it is the task of every responsible Danish politician to protect the interests of the Danish people! Otherwise, we might as well go home and let the EU handle it all! That we was reintroduced the permanent border control was an absolutely necessary protection against the increasing crime from Eastern Europe <U+0096> a crime that has more than doubled in a few years!But also a protection against mass immigration from the new <U+0096> so-called <U +0094>democracies<U+0094> in the Arab world. By the way, I don't understand why you run away from a democracy <U+0096> I thought you would help build it up. Several European countries have long ago have taken their precautions. In Germany, both police and customs officers check travelers who cross the border, and in Sweden the sight of customs officers on the other side of the √òresund Bridge is familiar to Danish tourists. Sweden also has <U+0096> as one of the few < U+0096> recognized our right to protect ourselves. No, Europe is not borderless. The only borderless thing is the hypocrisy <U+0096> especially from a country like Germany, whose politicians have acted as moral apostles together with French socialists in the EU -Parliament. Do you feel that the earth is burning beneath you? Is little Denmark a threat to your utopia? We do not want utopias. We demand respect for reality. The EU Commission raises its index finger menacingly. Denmark must not introduce a <U+0094>permanent<U+0094> border control. Our customs officers must not check the identity of suspicious persons. The Commission is in the process of breaking through the border control. My answer to the EU Commission is this: Run and jump! Don't get involved! We have the right to protect our own population.

But now we have succeeded in moving forward. Thanks to the Danish People's Party, the punishment for home robberies and rapes will be doubled, and efforts against itinerant criminals will be strengthened. We simply will no longer accept that itinerant gypsy gangs should make life miserable for the Danes with organized theft, pickpocketing, gambling or other scams and fraud. They must leave the country! Preferably immediately. And if there is an opportunity for them to serve their sentence in their home country, such an opportunity must of course be taken advantage of. All in all, it must be made much safer to be a Dane. That is why we are also strengthening efforts against rocker and immigrant crime < U+0096> and not only on the stone bridge in Copenhagen, but also here in the province, where rock castles shoot up like poisonous toadstools.

We don't want to find us in that brazen criminals must be able to play tricks with the police, as we recently saw in a video from Vollsmose near Odense. And then we once again strengthen the efforts for better integration. Denmark cannot afford that especially immigrants from non-Western countries do not contribute to society. They must start <U+0096> and it can only go too slowly. The goal is for ten percentage points more immigrants to work in the period 2010-2020. The signal must be: If you want to contribute, then you can stay! If you just want to enjoy, then go home <U+0096> you don't belong here.

54507.0,"Pia Kj√¶rsgaard's constitutional speech Sunday 5 June 2011 The weekly newsletter reproduces my constitutional speech, which I gave on Sunday 5 June in the beautiful surroundings of Lykkesholm Castle. As many as 800 supporters of the Danish People's Party turned up to celebrate the 162nd anniversary of the Constitution.-Want to know Has the population not had enough? Election campaign, election campaign. Blue bloc. Red bloc. the next day, of course, people have forgotten what the political commentators said - and COMPLETELY free of charge they can throw a new possible election date through the air. It's like the weather prophets. One promises a cold winter - another says the winter will be warm. of them are usually always right. And you know what - by November at the latest, one of these commentators will also be right - because eventually we MUST have elections. Exactly one year ago in this place, the election campaign was already the main theme. That's how it is been since the elections to the EU Parliament in 2009. In the Danish People's Party, we dare to meet the voters on election day - because we meet them all the time. All over the country. Every day. We don't just hand out brochures or go around Denmark because we think with the election coming tomorrow. No, we do that almost all year round - also outside the election campaigns. In connection with the just concluded negotiations on how to secure future welfare and Danish values, we have also constantly been in close dialogue with our voters. We have laid all the cards on the table ‚Äì ahead of the upcoming election. Our politics are not a lottery ticket. , where also the poet H.C. Andersen had his way. He had that at many manors, by the way, but he described Lykkesholm as ""the most beautiful place in Fyen"". We have come to celebrate the Danish Constitution. .162 years have passed since the fathers of the Constitution drew up this simple and solemn document, which forms the legislative framework around our Danish democracy <U+0096> one of the oldest in Europe. It is a law we should be proud of. Compared with The <U+0094>Lisbon Treaty<U+0094> of the EU bureaucrats, which resembles a telephone book in size but is only half as exciting, the Constitution is a masterpiece <U+0096> built to last for decades , yes, centuries. The constitution has grown out of the people, while the Treaty of Lisbon has been pressed down on the heads of the population. It is the ninth time that we have again chosen to gather for this lovely DF tradition - and I am happy to see that so many of you have chosen to spend the next few hours in our company. I can promise that it won't all be about politics. There is also something good for the palate - and good musical entertainment. Also take the opportunity to take a stroll in the park during the break - it's so beautiful here. Listen to the birds' songs. Maybe even hear the cuckoo's crow over on the other side of the lake! A lot can be said about the Danish People's Party. But you can't blame us for having slept away the spring. Nor can we be accused of lacking the courage to make some decisions, which have not always been easy! That is why it was absolutely crucial for the Danish People's Party to help find the famous DKK 47 billion to future-proof the Danish economy. Could the worn-out now also be sure of receiving back pay? Yes, of course! With the senior early pension scheme, worn-out people can now retire WITHOUT a work trial and other administrative difficulties. You don't even have to be a member of a social security fund to be able to get a senior early pension. This socially fair withdrawal scheme for seniors was actually the condition for the Danish People's Party to participate at all. In addition, the withdrawal scheme must be seen as part of a much larger whole <U+0096> a wide range of good initiatives. I can mention the BoligJobplanen, for example. quite ordinary Danes no longer feel like dangerous criminals because they have to replace a front door or fixtures in the bathroom <U+0096> or they don't have to do dangerous amateur work and be a danger to themselves or their surroundings. No, instead you can now get a deduction for home improvement expenses. And isn't it far more logical that the doctor spends his time treating patients and that the teacher spends time preparing his teaching <U+0096> than that the hunched over run around in an attic and carry out post-insulation or perhaps install a faucet incorrectly? Now it can be left to professionals again. At the same time as it boosts employment in smaller companies. I can also mention that we have ensured that the health sector in the period from 2014- 2020 will be strengthened by between 1.5 and 2 billion kroner annually, and these funds come on top of the five billion extra that was secured in connection with the recovery agreement. This means that we take into account the demographic development in Denmark with more elderly people. Among other things, there is a strengthening of the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases <U+0096>, in addition to which there is a historic investment of DKK 41 billion in better and up-to-date hospitals. In the Danish People's Party, we are proud that we have succeeded to set aside even more funds for treatment <U+0096> it was only possible with the help of the extra financial leeway that the agreements have given us. And what have the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party actually done themselves, while the rest of us sat for weeks at the negotiating table? Yes, they have done nothing but shout from the sidelines. They have done nothing to put their stamp on the agreement. They have done nothing to promote the interests of their constituents. Not a single fingerprint has been left on a agreement for the benefit of the welfare society's future. In my world, politics is about seeking influence. Politics is about maximum influence. This has also been the common thread in the Danish People's Party's policy from the beginning. However, for a brief remark, the Radicals took responsibility. We are disagreed about most things - but at least the radicals participated constructively in the negotiations <U+0096> opposite the Social Democracy. That the radicals then at the same time showed to everyone that they fundamentally do not agree with the Social Democracy or the Socialist People's Party on anything - I certainly won't bemoan that. It will be Helle Thorning-Schmidt's and Villy S√∏vndal's problem if they have to drag around Margrethe Vestager in a future red cabinet. Because they will do that if they get power <U+0096> and I emphasize <U+0096> if <U+0096> they get power. And the radicals always pay dearly. But Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal act like nothing. They say well enough that they want to maintain the strict immigration policy. But at the same time they have also said that they want to get rid of the start-up aid, so that foreigners must have full cash assistance from the first day they receive a residence permit in Denmark. They also want a more relaxed practice in the Immigration Service, and they want to roll back the point system in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfamily reunification .And all of this is probably agreed upon in the opposition. In addition, the demands of De Radikale for wanting to cooperate with S-SF. It is about abolishing the 24-year rule and the attachment requirement, and that Denmark must take in more asylum seekers , and that we must open our border more and make it easier to enter the green card scheme <U+0096> to name just a few of the radical demands. advice. Yes, it will probably be fun. ""Fair Solution"" is mostly based on wild speculation - among other things, a rock-solid belief that a large part of Denmark's problems can be solved if only all Danes work 12 more minutes a day or take a week's less vacation a year. The plan has certainly long since been put in the grave by all economists, because it is underfunded by somewhere between 15 and 20 billion kroner. But the more frayed the plan becomes, the more convulsively the duo Thorning- Schmidt and S√∏vndal take to it like shipwrecked to a raft. Well, it's a shame it's also printed on nice paper - and probably also in so many copies that it's impossible to get rid of it at all. And then you actually have to let the plan &eacuten thing: It is the only truly ORIGINAL thing that has come out of the two parties for years. The plan is theirs - and only theirs. No one else believes it. No one wants it! The plan belongs in the political garbage dump of Danish history. In the absence of real arguments, the Social Democrats and People's Socialists shoot right and left like pure desperadoes. A few days ago, the deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, Nick H√¶kkerup, launched a frontal attack on the country's banks <U +0096> because they don't <U+0094>like<U+0094> the economic plan of the Reds. That's why the banks have suddenly become <U+0094>political<U+0094> because they allow themselves to criticize a plan which every first-year student in economics can see that there is no connection. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party have also announced that there will be major changes in the civil service apparatus. People must understand that you cannot have such <U+0094>reactionaries<U+0094> elements sitting, who for ten years have served a bourgeois government. And not at all, when they don't even bother to dream along with the socialists' thoughts about the miracle medicine <U+0094>Fair solution<U+0094>. That it is about a clear break with Danish traditions <U+0096> because in this country the stable bureaucracy has always been one of the pillars of democracy <U+0096> the socialists don't care about that. Perhaps because they have been so busy copying President Obama, that they also want to copy the entire American system, where everything is replaced after a presidential election. And what about the free press? Yes, socialists have always had a bit of a hard time with freedom of expression <U+0096> there are long traditions for that. And doesn't the former chairman of the Danish Communist Party, Ole Sohn, who in his time cheek-kissed the GDR dictator Erich Honecker, completely agree that the <U+0094>reactionary bourgeois press<U+0094> must be limited in its possibilities of expression , because it slows down the world revolution? Perhaps that was the reason why Henrik Sass Larsen began to resent the bourgeois press. He is so tired of the bourgeois press that he has promised <U+0094>payback-time<U+0094> , if he comes to power. If he could, he would like to cancel the postage subsidy for Berlingske Tidende, he said. Editor-in-chief of Berlingske Tidende, Lisbeth Knudsen, does not understand the criticism. For weeks, she has not seen a reader's letter from Henrik Sass Larsen's hand <U +0096> that's why nothing has been recorded in the newspaper either. It's that simple. The vast majority of debate editors share sun and wind equally <U+0096> and try to present the readers with a versatile debate. How embarrassing! Social democratic <U+0094>cultural struggle<U+0094> to camouflage the obvious lack of real political visions.Social democratic censorship because the population must not hear criticism of <U+0094>the most brilliant plan of the century<U+0094>.And Villy S√∏vndal is not a notch better. Now the man has reached the point that he cannot open his mouth without pouring a bucket of rubbish over the Danish People's Party. This is, of course, something his large collegium of spin doctors has told him to do: <U+0094 >Now listen, Villy <U+0096> you just have to criticize Pia Kj√¶rsgaard and accuse her of breaking her promise if someone asks what SF wants. Then they don't think too much about all the strange things you yourself go around and says, and then the next day you suddenly don't mean anything anymore, because we say you have to mean something else <U+0096> that's brilliant spin, Villy<U+0094>. You can imagine how Villy S√∏vndal backs down thoughtfully on his pipe, and says that <U+0094>it might not be so crazy after all. As soon as I get into government<U+0094>. No, Villy S√∏vndal only means one thing: That which can give him power. one day an attack on Hizb-ut-Tahrir <U+0096> the next day higher punishments for criminals and an adherence to the 24-year rule. Or visits to 20-30-40 nursing homes, Villy S√∏vndal has great difficulty with the truth. The unfortunate is that Villy S√∏vndal's party does not agree with him on very much at all. They tolerate him exactly as long as he tries to get the Socialist People's Party into government. Yes, of course I don't know how you feel. I am only attracted by honesty .The scariest thing, however, is that the voters are cruelly taken for fools. Because I can assure you that Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal do not believe in their own plan either. And so do Henrik Sass Larsen, Morten B√∏dskov and Ole Sohn for not for that matter either - and certainly not the trade union movement. They will then say run and jump to work more. The voters cannot be told what S and SF will do to make ends meet in the Danish economy - because they will have to. After all, the two parties welcomed the EU's budget monitoring. This means that they have to find the money - and that they cannot pursue pure Anker J√∏rgensen politics, even if they wanted to. This means one thing: More taxes and taxes to the Danes. Either in the form of direct taxation of owner-occupied homes <U+0096> nor should we forget here that Enhedslisten also demands influence and would very much like to see increased housing taxation. It is an idea that the radicals LOVE. Ole Sohn admittedly denied it in a famous TV debate with Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen, where Ole Sohn shouted and screamed because Hjort referred to previous statements from Sohn... Or they are simply driving the Danish economy all the way to where the interest rate automatically comes to to increase. This means increased unemployment. This means that many will be leaving home and home. Especially first-time buyers, who can only thank the variable loans for getting a foothold in the housing market. Honestly! Is the choice that difficult? The government and The Danish People's Party has found the DKK 47 billion. There will be no unpleasant surprises - no new creative taxes and fees. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party, on the other hand, twist and turn every single brain cell in the hunt for funding. They talk and talk <U+0096> more than they think !One day a toll ring must be established around Copenhagen, which could end up costing motorists an extra 18,000 per year. The next day tobacco, fat, sweets ‚Äì and spring water at workplaces ‚Äì will be subject to a fire tax. Socialists love to TALK about justice, but have more difficulty exercising it in practice. The rest of us can be happy that we still have freedom of speech <U+0096> and that critical economists can still speak in the so-called <U+0094>bourgeois<U+0094> press .Who knows how long it will last... When did any of you last drive across the border into Germany? Did you notice the guard towers? Did you see the Spanish horsemen with barbed wire? Did you have your car and luggage searched by overzealous customs officials? Denmark is the new fortress in Europe. No one enters here <U+0096> and even those who travel out are thoroughly investigated. No, of course this is pure nonsense and nonsense! But if the hysteria in the EU Commission, in parts of foreign countries and among domestic EU supporters, that is exactly what Denmark has done. We have closed the country <U+0096> so now we can really sit and enjoy ourselves in our allotment garden idyll! Now it is like this with the EU that <U+0094>reality<U+0094> is a foreign word. In the EU, reality is not in high demand. Neither are the nations and the concern for the safety of the population. The EU is only interested in utopias and ideas. In this case, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <U+0094>borderless<U+0094> Europe. It's such a neat idea that if you lift the borders, the nations will eventually disappear too... And that <U+0094>borderless Europe<U+0094> has also had a price. But I am not sure that the family that has been attacked by unscrupulous, Eastern European home robbers shares the dream of a borderless Europe. Nor do I think that the elderly couple that has been emptied by burglars their home - everything they have collected together over a lifetime - shares the EU's utopias. Naturally, it is the task of every responsible Danish politician to protect the interests of the Danish people! Otherwise, we might as well go home and let the EU handle it all! That we was reintroduced the permanent border control was an absolutely necessary protection against the increasing crime from Eastern Europe <U+0096> a crime that has more than doubled in a few years!But also a protection against mass immigration from the new <U+0096> so-called <U +0094>democracies<U+0094> in the Arab world.

It is the ninth time that we have again chosen to gather for this lovely DF tradition - and I am happy to see that so many of you have chosen to spend the next few hours in our company. I can promise that it won't all be about politics. There is also something good for the palate - and good musical entertainment. Also take the opportunity to take a stroll in the park during the break - it's so beautiful here. Listen to the birds' songs. Maybe even hear the cuckoo's crow over on the other side of the lake! A lot can be said about the Danish People's Party. But you can't blame us for having slept away the spring. Nor can we be accused of lacking the courage to make some decisions, which have not always been easy! That is why it was absolutely crucial for the Danish People's Party to help find the famous DKK 47 billion to future-proof the Danish economy. Could the worn-out now also be sure of receiving back pay? Yes, of course! With the senior early pension scheme, worn-out people can now retire WITHOUT a work trial and other administrative difficulties. You don't even have to be a member of a social security fund to be able to get a senior early pension. This socially fair withdrawal scheme for seniors was actually the condition for the Danish People's Party to participate at all. In addition, the withdrawal scheme must be seen as part of a much larger whole <U+0096> a wide range of good initiatives. I can mention the BoligJobplanen, for example. quite ordinary Danes no longer feel like dangerous criminals because they have to replace a front door or fixtures in the bathroom <U+0096> or they don't have to do dangerous amateur work and be a danger to themselves or their surroundings. No, instead you can now get a deduction for home improvement expenses. And isn't it far more logical that the doctor spends his time treating patients and that the teacher spends time preparing his teaching <U+0096> than that the hunched over run around in an attic and carry out post-insulation or perhaps install a faucet incorrectly? Now it can be left to professionals again. At the same time as it boosts employment in smaller companies. I can also mention that we have ensured that the health sector in the period from 2014- 2020 will be strengthened by between 1.5 and 2 billion kroner annually, and these funds come on top of the five billion extra that was secured in connection with the recovery agreement. This means that we take into account the demographic development in Denmark with more elderly people. Among other things, there is a strengthening of the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases <U+0096>, in addition to which there is a historic investment of DKK 41 billion in better and up-to-date hospitals. In the Danish People's Party, we are proud that we have succeeded to set aside even more funds for treatment <U+0096> it was only possible with the help of the extra financial leeway that the agreements have given us. And what have the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party actually done themselves, while the rest of us sat for weeks at the negotiating table? Yes, they have done nothing but shout from the sidelines. They have done nothing to put their stamp on the agreement. They have done nothing to promote the interests of their constituents. Not a single fingerprint has been left on a agreement for the benefit of the welfare society's future. In my world, politics is about seeking influence. Politics is about maximum influence. This has also been the common thread in the Danish People's Party's policy from the beginning. However, for a brief remark, the Radicals took responsibility. We are disagreed about most things - but at least the radicals participated constructively in the negotiations <U+0096> opposite the Social Democracy. That the radicals then at the same time showed to everyone that they fundamentally do not agree with the Social Democracy or the Socialist People's Party on anything - I certainly won't bemoan that. It will be Helle Thorning-Schmidt's and Villy S√∏vndal's problem if they have to drag around Margrethe Vestager in a future red cabinet. Because they will do that if they get power <U+0096> and I emphasize <U+0096> if <U+0096> they get power. And the radicals always pay dearly. But Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal act like nothing. They say well enough that they want to maintain the strict immigration policy. But at the same time they have also said that they want to get rid of the start-up aid, so that foreigners must have full cash assistance from the first day they receive a residence permit in Denmark. They also want a more relaxed practice in the Immigration Service, and they want to roll back the point system in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfamily reunification .And all of this is probably agreed upon in the opposition. In addition, the demands of De Radikale for wanting to cooperate with S-SF. It is about abolishing the 24-year rule and the attachment requirement, and that Denmark must take in more asylum seekers , and that we must open our border more and make it easier to enter the green card scheme <U+0096> to name just a few of the radical demands. advice. Yes, it will probably be fun. ""Fair Solution"" is mostly based on wild speculation - among other things, a rock-solid belief that a large part of Denmark's problems can be solved if only all Danes work 12 more minutes a day or take a week's less vacation a year. The plan has certainly long since been put in the grave by all economists, because it is underfunded by somewhere between 15 and 20 billion kroner. But the more frayed the plan becomes, the more convulsively the duo Thorning- Schmidt and S√∏vndal take to it like shipwrecked to a raft. Well, it's a shame it's also printed on nice paper - and probably also in so many copies that it's impossible to get rid of it at all. And then you actually have to let the plan &eacuten thing: It is the only truly ORIGINAL thing that has come out of the two parties for years. The plan is theirs - and only theirs. No one else believes it. No one wants it! The plan belongs in the political garbage dump of Danish history. In the absence of real arguments, the Social Democrats and People's Socialists shoot right and left like pure desperadoes. A few days ago, the deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, Nick H√¶kkerup, launched a frontal attack on the country's banks <U +0096> because they don't <U+0094>like<U+0094> the economic plan of the Reds. That's why the banks have suddenly become <U+0094>political<U+0094> because they allow themselves to criticize a plan which every first-year student in economics can see that there is no connection. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party have also announced that there will be major changes in the civil service apparatus. People must understand that you cannot have such <U+0094>reactionaries<U+0094> elements sitting, who for ten years have served a bourgeois government. And not at all, when they don't even bother to dream along with the socialists' thoughts about the miracle medicine <U+0094>Fair solution<U+0094>. That it is about a clear break with Danish traditions <U+0096> because in this country the stable bureaucracy has always been one of the pillars of democracy <U+0096> the socialists don't care about that. Perhaps because they have been so busy copying President Obama, that they also want to copy the entire American system, where everything is replaced after a presidential election. And what about the free press? Yes, socialists have always had a bit of a hard time with freedom of expression <U+0096> there are long traditions for that. And doesn't the former chairman of the Danish Communist Party, Ole Sohn, who in his time cheek-kissed the GDR dictator Erich Honecker, completely agree that the <U+0094>reactionary bourgeois press<U+0094> must be limited in its possibilities of expression , because it slows down the world revolution? Perhaps that was the reason why Henrik Sass Larsen began to resent the bourgeois press. He is so tired of the bourgeois press that he has promised <U+0094>payback-time<U+0094> , if he comes to power. If he could, he would like to cancel the postage subsidy for Berlingske Tidende, he said. Editor-in-chief of Berlingske Tidende, Lisbeth Knudsen, does not understand the criticism. For weeks, she has not seen a reader's letter from Henrik Sass Larsen's hand <U +0096> that's why nothing has been recorded in the newspaper either. It's that simple. The vast majority of debate editors share sun and wind equally <U+0096> and try to present the readers with a versatile debate. How embarrassing! Social democratic <U+0094>cultural struggle<U+0094> to camouflage the obvious lack of real political visions.Social democratic censorship because the population must not hear criticism of <U+0094>the most brilliant plan of the century<U+0094>.And Villy S√∏vndal is not a notch better. Now the man has reached the point that he cannot open his mouth without pouring a bucket of rubbish over the Danish People's Party. This is, of course, something his large collegium of spin doctors has told him to do: <U+0094 >Now listen, Villy <U+0096> you just have to criticize Pia Kj√¶rsgaard and accuse her of breaking her promise if someone asks what SF wants. Then they don't think too much about all the strange things you yourself go around and says, and then the next day you suddenly don't mean anything anymore, because we say you have to mean something else <U+0096> that's brilliant spin, Villy<U+0094>. You can imagine how Villy S√∏vndal backs down thoughtfully on his pipe, and says that <U+0094>it might not be so crazy after all. As soon as I get into government<U+0094>. No, Villy S√∏vndal only means one thing: That which can give him power. one day an attack on Hizb-ut-Tahrir <U+0096> the next day higher punishments for criminals and an adherence to the 24-year rule. Or visits to 20-30-40 nursing homes, Villy S√∏vndal has great difficulty with the truth. The unfortunate is that Villy S√∏vndal's party does not agree with him on very much at all. They tolerate him exactly as long as he tries to get the Socialist People's Party into government. Yes, of course I don't know how you feel. I am only attracted by honesty .The scariest thing, however, is that the voters are cruelly taken for fools. Because I can assure you that Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal do not believe in their own plan either. And so do Henrik Sass Larsen, Morten B√∏dskov and Ole Sohn for not for that matter either - and certainly not the trade union movement. They will then say run and jump to work more. The voters cannot be told what S and SF will do to make ends meet in the Danish economy - because they will have to. After all, the two parties welcomed the EU's budget monitoring. This means that they have to find the money - and that they cannot pursue pure Anker J√∏rgensen politics, even if they wanted to. This means one thing: More taxes and taxes to the Danes. Either in the form of direct taxation of owner-occupied homes <U+0096> nor should we forget here that Enhedslisten also demands influence and would very much like to see increased housing taxation. It is an idea that the radicals LOVE. Ole Sohn admittedly denied it in a famous TV debate with Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen, where Ole Sohn shouted and screamed because Hjort referred to previous statements from Sohn... Or they are simply driving the Danish economy all the way to where the interest rate automatically comes to to increase. This means increased unemployment. This means that many will be leaving home and home. Especially first-time buyers, who can only thank the variable loans for getting a foothold in the housing market. Honestly! Is the choice that difficult? The government and The Danish People's Party has found the DKK 47 billion. There will be no unpleasant surprises - no new creative taxes and fees. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party, on the other hand, twist and turn every single brain cell in the hunt for funding. They talk and talk <U+0096> more than they think !One day a toll ring must be established around Copenhagen, which could end up costing motorists an extra 18,000 per year. The next day tobacco, fat, sweets ‚Äì and spring water at workplaces ‚Äì will be subject to a fire tax. Socialists love to TALK about justice, but have more difficulty exercising it in practice. The rest of us can be happy that we still have freedom of speech <U+0096> and that critical economists can still speak in the so-called <U+0094>bourgeois<U+0094> press .Who knows how long it will last... When did any of you last drive across the border into Germany? Did you notice the guard towers? Did you see the Spanish horsemen with barbed wire? Did you have your car and luggage searched by overzealous customs officials? Denmark is the new fortress in Europe. No one enters here <U+0096> and even those who travel out are thoroughly investigated. No, of course this is pure nonsense and nonsense! But if the hysteria in the EU Commission, in parts of foreign countries and among domestic EU supporters, that is exactly what Denmark has done. We have closed the country <U+0096> so now we can really sit and enjoy ourselves in our allotment garden idyll! Now it is like this with the EU that <U+0094>reality<U+0094> is a foreign word. In the EU, reality is not in high demand. Neither are the nations and the concern for the safety of the population. The EU is only interested in utopias and ideas. In this case, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <U+0094>borderless<U+0094> Europe. It's such a neat idea that if you lift the borders, the nations will eventually disappear too... And that <U+0094>borderless Europe<U+0094> has also had a price. But I am not sure that the family that has been attacked by unscrupulous, Eastern European home robbers shares the dream of a borderless Europe. Nor do I think that the elderly couple that has been emptied by burglars their home - everything they have collected together over a lifetime - shares the EU's utopias. Naturally, it is the task of every responsible Danish politician to protect the interests of the Danish people! Otherwise, we might as well go home and let the EU handle it all! That we was reintroduced the permanent border control was an absolutely necessary protection against the increasing crime from Eastern Europe <U+0096> a crime that has more than doubled in a few years!But also a protection against mass immigration from the new <U+0096> so-called <U +0094>democracies<U+0094> in the Arab world. By the way, I don't understand why you run away from a democracy <U+0096> I thought you would help build it up. Several European countries have long ago have taken their precautions. In Germany, both police and customs officers check travelers who cross the border, and in Sweden the sight of customs officers on the other side of the √òresund Bridge is familiar to Danish tourists. Sweden also has <U+0096> as one of the few < U+0096> recognized our right to protect ourselves. No, Europe is not borderless. The only borderless thing is the hypocrisy <U+0096> especially from a country like Germany, whose politicians have acted as moral apostles together with French socialists in the EU -Parliament. Do you feel that the earth is burning beneath you? Is little Denmark a threat to your utopia? We do not want utopias. We demand respect for reality. The EU Commission raises its index finger menacingly. Denmark must not introduce a <U+0094>permanent<U+0094> border control. Our customs officers must not check the identity of suspicious persons. The Commission is in the process of breaking through the border control. My answer to the EU Commission is this: Run and jump! Don't get involved! We have the right to protect our own population. If it is against the Schengen agreement <U+0096> yes, then Denmark must LEAVE the Schengen cooperation! Now I honestly hope that the government is just as steely <U+0096> that it remembers who it made an agreement with. That the Socialist People's Party is in the process of falling flat for the EU is so sad. A lot has happened in SF since <U+0094> Holger and the wife said no to the union<U+0094>. Socialist People's Party belongs to the group of <U+0094>EU converts<U+0094>. They would prefer to say yes and amen to everything.<U+0094>Oh , it is so embarrassing when the EU criticizes us <U+0096> we are so small and insignificant<U+0094> This is how the Danish supporters bow and refuse. The EU Commission's power well <U+0096> or the Danish self-torture... All realists <U+0096> including the Danish Customs and Tax Association have said that they have no doubt at all that border controls pay off. Among other things, this is why border controls have come to stay!! But when it comes to Danes' safety, border control cannot of course stand alone. I have already mentioned how we have ensured economic safety with historic agreements. But safety is also about the right to travel safely everywhere. That is why Dansk has The People's Party since the party's foundation has toiled and dragged to make Denmark a safer place to be. It is true that it has not always been easy. But now we have succeeded in moving forward. Thanks to the Danish People's Party, the punishment for home robberies and rapes will be doubled, and efforts against itinerant criminals will be strengthened. We simply will no longer accept that itinerant gypsy gangs should make life miserable for the Danes with organized theft, pickpocketing, gambling or other scams and fraud. They must leave the country! Preferably immediately. And if there is an opportunity for them to serve their sentence in their home country, such an opportunity must of course be taken advantage of. All in all, it must be made much safer to be a Dane. That is why we are also strengthening efforts against rocker and immigrant crime < U+0096> and not only on the stone bridge in Copenhagen, but also here in the province, where rock castles shoot up like poisonous toadstools. We don't want to find ourselves in organized crime. We don't want to find ourselves in shootings on the streets. We don't want to find us in that brazen criminals must be able to play tricks with the police, as we recently saw in a video from Vollsmose near Odense. And then we once again strengthen the efforts for better integration. Denmark cannot afford that especially immigrants from non-Western countries do not contribute to society. They must start <U+0096> and it can only go too slowly. The goal is for ten percentage points more immigrants to work in the period 2010-2020. The signal must be: If you want to contribute, then you can stay! If you just want to enjoy, then go home <U+0096> you don't belong here. We even want to get rid of you so much that we'll give you some money along the way! It is also about values ‚Äã‚Äãand how we secure these values. Without security <U+0096> no values. Just as immigration, integration and welfare go hand in hand, so do security, democracy and values. It is a whole !Yes, I think we can be really proud. We have come a long way. We are going to the upcoming general election on the best possible basis, and with talented candidates who want to make an effort <U+0096> not only for the Danish People's Party , but for the whole of Denmark <U+0096> including those who don't vote for the Danish People's Party.

54507.0,"Pia Kj√¶rsgaard's constitutional speech Sunday 5 June 2011 The weekly newsletter reproduces my constitutional speech, which I gave on Sunday 5 June in the beautiful surroundings of Lykkesholm Castle. As many as 800 supporters of the Danish People's Party turned up to celebrate the 162nd anniversary of the Constitution.-Want to know Has the population not had enough? Election campaign, election campaign. Blue bloc. Red bloc. the next day, of course, people have forgotten what the political commentators said - and COMPLETELY free of charge they can throw a new possible election date through the air. It's like the weather prophets. One promises a cold winter - another says the winter will be warm. of them are usually always right. And you know what - by November at the latest, one of these commentators will also be right - because eventually we MUST have elections. Exactly one year ago in this place, the election campaign was already the main theme. That's how it is been since the elections to the EU Parliament in 2009. In the Danish People's Party, we dare to meet the voters on election day - because we meet them all the time. All over the country. Every day. We don't just hand out brochures or go around Denmark because we think with the election coming tomorrow. No, we do that almost all year round - also outside the election campaigns. In connection with the just concluded negotiations on how to secure future welfare and Danish values, we have also constantly been in close dialogue with our voters. We have laid all the cards on the table ‚Äì ahead of the upcoming election. Our politics are not a lottery ticket. , where also the poet H.C. Andersen had his way. He had that at many manors, by the way, but he described Lykkesholm as ""the most beautiful place in Fyen"". We have come to celebrate the Danish Constitution. .162 years have passed since the fathers of the Constitution drew up this simple and solemn document, which forms the legislative framework around our Danish democracy <U+0096> one of the oldest in Europe. It is a law we should be proud of.

This is, of course, something his large collegium of spin doctors has told him to do: <U+0094 >Now listen, Villy <U+0096> you just have to criticize Pia Kj√¶rsgaard and accuse her of breaking her promise if someone asks what SF wants. Then they don't think too much about all the strange things you yourself go around and says, and then the next day you suddenly don't mean anything anymore, because we say you have to mean something else <U+0096> that's brilliant spin, Villy<U+0094>. You can imagine how Villy S√∏vndal backs down thoughtfully on his pipe, and says that <U+0094>it might not be so crazy after all. As soon as I get into government<U+0094>. No, Villy S√∏vndal only means one thing: That which can give him power. one day an attack on Hizb-ut-Tahrir <U+0096> the next day higher punishments for criminals and an adherence to the 24-year rule. Or visits to 20-30-40 nursing homes, Villy S√∏vndal has great difficulty with the truth. The unfortunate is that Villy S√∏vndal's party does not agree with him on very much at all. They tolerate him exactly as long as he tries to get the Socialist People's Party into government. Yes, of course I don't know how you feel. I am only attracted by honesty .The scariest thing, however, is that the voters are cruelly taken for fools. Because I can assure you that Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal do not believe in their own plan either. And so do Henrik Sass Larsen, Morten B√∏dskov and Ole Sohn for not for that matter either - and certainly not the trade union movement. They will then say run and jump to work more. The voters cannot be told what S and SF will do to make ends meet in the Danish economy - because they will have to. After all, the two parties welcomed the EU's budget monitoring. This means that they have to find the money - and that they cannot pursue pure Anker J√∏rgensen politics, even if they wanted to. This means one thing: More taxes and taxes to the Danes. Either in the form of direct taxation of owner-occupied homes <U+0096> nor should we forget here that Enhedslisten also demands influence and would very much like to see increased housing taxation. It is an idea that the radicals LOVE. Ole Sohn admittedly denied it in a famous TV debate with Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen, where Ole Sohn shouted and screamed because Hjort referred to previous statements from Sohn... Or they are simply driving the Danish economy all the way to where the interest rate automatically comes to to increase. This means increased unemployment. This means that many will be leaving home and home. Especially first-time buyers, who can only thank the variable loans for getting a foothold in the housing market. Honestly! Is the choice that difficult? The government and The Danish People's Party has found the DKK 47 billion. There will be no unpleasant surprises - no new creative taxes and fees. The Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party, on the other hand, twist and turn every single brain cell in the hunt for funding. They talk and talk <U+0096> more than they think !One day a toll ring must be established around Copenhagen, which could end up costing motorists an extra 18,000 per year. The next day tobacco, fat, sweets ‚Äì and spring water at workplaces ‚Äì will be subject to a fire tax. Socialists love to TALK about justice, but have more difficulty exercising it in practice. The rest of us can be happy that we still have freedom of speech <U+0096> and that critical economists can still speak in the so-called <U+0094>bourgeois<U+0094> press .Who knows how long it will last... When did any of you last drive across the border into Germany? Did you notice the guard towers? Did you see the Spanish horsemen with barbed wire? Did you have your car and luggage searched by overzealous customs officials? Denmark is the new fortress in Europe. No one enters here <U+0096> and even those who travel out are thoroughly investigated. No, of course this is pure nonsense and nonsense! But if the hysteria in the EU Commission, in parts of foreign countries and among domestic EU supporters, that is exactly what Denmark has done. We have closed the country <U+0096> so now we can really sit and enjoy ourselves in our allotment garden idyll! Now it is like this with the EU that <U+0094>reality<U+0094> is a foreign word. In the EU, reality is not in high demand. Neither are the nations and the concern for the safety of the population. The EU is only interested in utopias and ideas. In this case, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <U+0094>borderless<U+0094> Europe. It's such a neat idea that if you lift the borders, the nations will eventually disappear too... And that <U+0094>borderless Europe<U+0094> has also had a price. But I am not sure that the family that has been attacked by unscrupulous, Eastern European home robbers shares the dream of a borderless Europe. Nor do I think that the elderly couple that has been emptied by burglars their home - everything they have collected together over a lifetime - shares the EU's utopias. Naturally, it is the task of every responsible Danish politician to protect the interests of the Danish people! Otherwise, we might as well go home and let the EU handle it all! That we was reintroduced the permanent border control was an absolutely necessary protection against the increasing crime from Eastern Europe <U+0096> a crime that has more than doubled in a few years!But also a protection against mass immigration from the new <U+0096> so-called <U +0094>democracies<U+0094> in the Arab world. By the way, I don't understand why you run away from a democracy <U+0096> I thought you would help build it up. Several European countries have long ago have taken their precautions. In Germany, both police and customs officers check travelers who cross the border, and in Sweden the sight of customs officers on the other side of the √òresund Bridge is familiar to Danish tourists. Sweden also has <U+0096> as one of the few < U+0096> recognized our right to protect ourselves. No, Europe is not borderless. The only borderless thing is the hypocrisy <U+0096> especially from a country like Germany, whose politicians have acted as moral apostles together with French socialists in the EU -Parliament. Do you feel that the earth is burning beneath you? Is little Denmark a threat to your utopia? We do not want utopias. We demand respect for reality. The EU Commission raises its index finger menacingly. Denmark must not introduce a <U+0094>permanent<U+0094> border control. Our customs officers must not check the identity of suspicious persons. The Commission is in the process of breaking through the border control. My answer to the EU Commission is this: Run and jump! Don't get involved! We have the right to protect our own population. If it is against the Schengen agreement <U+0096> yes, then Denmark must LEAVE the Schengen cooperation! Now I honestly hope that the government is just as steely <U+0096> that it remembers who it made an agreement with. That the Socialist People's Party is in the process of falling flat for the EU is so sad. A lot has happened in SF since <U+0094> Holger and the wife said no to the union<U+0094>. Socialist People's Party belongs to the group of <U+0094>EU converts<U+0094>. They would prefer to say yes and amen to everything.<U+0094>Oh , it is so embarrassing when the EU criticizes us <U+0096> we are so small and insignificant<U+0094> This is how the Danish supporters bow and refuse. The EU Commission's power well <U+0096> or the Danish self-torture... All realists <U+0096> including the Danish Customs and Tax Association have said that they have no doubt at all that border controls pay off. Among other things, this is why border controls have come to stay!! But when it comes to Danes' safety, border control cannot of course stand alone. I have already mentioned how we have ensured economic safety with historic agreements. But safety is also about the right to travel safely everywhere. That is why Dansk has The People's Party since the party's foundation has toiled and dragged to make Denmark a safer place to be. It is true that it has not always been easy. But now we have succeeded in moving forward. Thanks to the Danish People's Party, the punishment for home robberies and rapes will be doubled, and efforts against itinerant criminals will be strengthened. We simply will no longer accept that itinerant gypsy gangs should make life miserable for the Danes with organized theft, pickpocketing, gambling or other scams and fraud. They must leave the country! Preferably immediately. And if there is an opportunity for them to serve their sentence in their home country, such an opportunity must of course be taken advantage of. All in all, it must be made much safer to be a Dane. That is why we are also strengthening efforts against rocker and immigrant crime < U+0096> and not only on the stone bridge in Copenhagen, but also here in the province, where rock castles shoot up like poisonous toadstools. We don't want to find ourselves in organized crime. We don't want to find ourselves in shootings on the streets. We don't want to find us in that brazen criminals must be able to play tricks with the police, as we recently saw in a video from Vollsmose near Odense. And then we once again strengthen the efforts for better integration. Denmark cannot afford that especially immigrants from non-Western countries do not contribute to society. They must start <U+0096> and it can only go too slowly. The goal is for ten percentage points more immigrants to work in the period 2010-2020. The signal must be: If you want to contribute, then you can stay! If you just want to enjoy, then go home <U+0096> you don't belong here. We even want to get rid of you so much that we'll give you some money along the way! It is also about values ‚Äã‚Äãand how we secure these values. Without security <U+0096> no values. Just as immigration, integration and welfare go hand in hand, so do security, democracy and values. It is a whole !Yes, I think we can be really proud. We have come a long way. We are going to the upcoming general election on the best possible basis, and with talented candidates who want to make an effort <U+0096> not only for the Danish People's Party , but for the whole of Denmark <U+0096> including those who don't vote for the Danish People's Party.

54161.0,"Here you can read Mette Frederiksen's full speech to the congress 2017. Dear congress, Thanks to Thomas. Thanks to Arne and Joy. Three of Denmark's best mayors. And Thomas Kastrup Larsen. Mayor here in the city; as an old Aalborg resident, shouldn't I be allowed to say a special thank you? You do it simply so well. I am a child of the 80s. Here in the city. It was a hard time. Not least in my childhood neighborhood. Gr√∏nlandskvarteret .My mother was a daycare mother. And we often sat in the kitchen. We had such a round kitchen table. There was coffee on the pot. came to visit. When my father's colleagues couldn't keep up and dropped out of the labor market. Rents that were difficult to pay. I don't remember all the conversations. But I remember the feeling. When as a child you could see grown people being sad. That was how the poor eighties were. But Aalborg and Denmark rose up. Things got going in the 90s. The social democratic government got rid of unemployment. The university grew strongly. And many of us who come from families where there was not much education .We got the opportunity. The big social problems that were here in the city in the 80s have not all disappeared. But the prosperity is greater. The opportunities are more. Aalborg is a better city today. Dear Congress: Let's give Thomas Kastrup Larsen a huge hand. When the Danes were asked some time ago to vote for the country's best mayors, third place went to a social democrat. 2. the place went to a social democrat. And yes, 1st place went to a social democrat. First place among the Danes. We have it. It requires humility. Hard work and responsiveness. We will make an effort. There are now only 66 days until we Danes go to the polls. An election that is at least as important as the one for the Folketing. We can do a lot in Christiansborg with legislation. But often our mayors and regional chairmen can do even more. We got a good election last time. Now we have to win even more Danes' trust. Continue to have the steering wheel in the health area. We are going to win back cities. We will fight hard for victory on November 21. Dear all top candidates, stand up straight! Candidates for city councils and regions, you too! Dear Congress , give our candidates a big hand. Dear Congress, We Danes are faced with a decisive political choice: Do we want to strengthen or weaken what has made Denmark strong? Namely our welfare society. We have made our choice. We want to be united for Denmark .And there are three things I want to talk about today.I want to talk about our elderly.I want a showdown with the centralization of Denmark.And I want to ensure the security of the Danes. something with you. When I went to the people's meeting in June, I decided to put aside my traditional party leadership speech. I spoke instead about a young girl I know. A young girl who was doing well with school, friends, and the parties. Everything went well, but the film broke. The psychological vulnerability hit hard and brutally. She dropped out of the program. many of you who listened also thought of a young person. Not just her, I had for my inner gaze. But someone else who is also not well. I simply got so many reactions to that speech. Mental vulnerability among children and young people are no longer a problem for a few families. It has become a big and growing societal problem. Now we all know someone who is not well. Our own young people in DSU have been saying this for a long time. Thank you DSU. Thank you , because you give voice to some of the young people who are having a hard time. Who can't speak up themselves. There is something not working in our society when so many children and young people struggle with life. With themselves. Against himself. And some unreasonably high expectations. Not least created on social media. Of course we can and must do something political. In our education system. In psychiatry. And we must look with great self-criticism at the decisions we ourselves have helped make. But the answer is not just new politics and more money. I think this is much bigger. There is something in our culture that puts pressure on our children. I think we have put too much on the individual. You have become the smith of your own luck. And adversity is also become your own. Perhaps we say too much: We believe in you. Instead of: We believe in each other. The young girl I spoke of has gotten better. Fortunately. But there are so many others. I have not all the answers. But I now know that it is one of the most important tasks. To break the loneliness and the taboos. I know. I know that we must take better care of our children and young people. We must take better care of the youngest. And we must also take better care of our elders. We have good care for the elderly in many places. I can see it when I visit nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. Skilled employees who help stretch out the old legs. Smile on the lips and a strong arm around the shoulder. Professionalism and care. I have just visited the nursing home on L√¶s√∏. There were both good legs (i.e. the ones you eat), brown sauce and red wine. But there is also another reality. Busyness. Elderly people who lie in bed for too long .Demented person left to her own devices because there is only one night shift at work.An old lady who is alone in the hospital and is scared.There is no one who has time to tell her what is going to happen.No one , who have time to be there. Is it really our thanks to those who have built Denmark? I don't think we can be familiar with it. We can start by feeling for ourselves. Do we want to end our lives in solitude ?I know that the employees are doing what you can. With the time that has now been given to you. You run fast. And when one of your colleagues gets sick, the others run even harder. Many would rather stay for a while after midnight than leave a resident who is upset. .And I know that you who sit in the city councils. You also do what you can. To avoid that the savings will once again hit the elderly area. But dear friends. When we want to have a strong welfare society. Then it is not only about preventing savings. We must of course have elderly care, we can be familiar with. Where there is time for the individual person. Those who are our oldest right now are probably some of those in our society who have the strongest food traditions. So many potatoes have been boiled, so many meatballs shaped and so many beets pickled by the +80-year-olds in this society. Don't we owe it to our old people to serve some decent food when the hand can no longer hold a potato peeler? We want care for the elderly where the food smells and tastes good. We want care for the elderly with dignity. It is not dignified, that a grown man has to lie in a wet nappy. We want to challenge that. It is not quality when an old lady who has pickled and baked all her life is eaten by bad food. We want to challenge that. We let each other down , when our old people struggle with loneliness and barely have time to greet the home helper before she is out the door again. We want to challenge that. Dear Congress; Denmark. Three goals that should be self-evident. But unfortunately they are not everywhere. 1: More community. Less loneliness. 2: Proper food that both tastes and smells 3: More time. That's what we want. Can we promise to have it all introduced at once? No. Not in one year. Not even in two. But that's what we want to work for. Step by step. Budget by budget. And we'll start now. And once for Prince Knud. And for Anders Samuelsen. And for Kristian Jensen. If the money is once spent on top tax relief, then it cannot also be used for welfare. We know that. And the Danes know that. That is why we say: Welfare first. And what is welfare? It has become such a word that everyone uses. And maybe we have made it too technical? What do you think when I say welfare? I can tell you what I think of myself. I think of Linda, Sabine and Lasse. How many of you have tried to drop off a little one at nursery or kindergarten? Yes, many of us have. Do you remember it? It can hurt your stomach. I think it was so hard. To stand there and say goodbye while the tears ran down my cheeks. Both for my children and for myself. And the guilty conscience on top of that. I can remember it so clearly. The little one in the nursery. I passed her on to Sabine. Out through the wardrobe. I knows the door. The kind with a handle high up so the little ones can't reach it. Out of the tiled hallway. I turned around. The little one happy again. Because of Sabine. They had spotted something in the window. They looked and pointed. And waved at me. Linda, Lasse and Sabine. It was you who were standing with my children. in my arms when I turned around on the playground and waved the best thing I've learned. That's what welfare is all about. Is there a Lasse to give your child to in the morning? Is there a nurse with time when that person, we care about, get a cancer diagnosis? We can't promise a lot of new money. But we promise to give our employees more time with people instead of paper. This is the core of the fingers-away reform we are proposing. We politicians set the goals. The teachers, pedagogues, police officers and their managers decide how they want to achieve them. A completely new way of managing the public sector. The Social Democrats have always been prepared to take responsibility. Also for the difficult decisions. In government and in opposition. It is in our DNA. But we always remember to ask: What is the purpose? Why are we making this decision? We do not make reforms for the sake of reforms. We must always be sure that we run the public sector efficiently. On the other hand, there were still those beautiful flip phones. Denmark is affected by bird flu. Br√∏ndby's Daniel Agger is sold to Liverpool (he luckily came back). And the Queen announces that she no longer wants to smoke in public. A lot happens that year. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is at the time Minister of Health and the Interior. And he spends much of the year preparing the municipal reform. It sounded so good at the time. Lars L√∏kke said that the reform would give the citizens ""the best solution - at the cheapest price"". And yet it sounded better when L√∏kke wrote: ""The municipal reform makes it more attractive to live in the countryside"". Great words from Lars L√∏kke. But has it gotten better and cheaper in the 10 years that have passed? Have we got stronger local communities? has the difference between country and city decreased? More shops have closed. Fewer bus routes. Many schools have closed down. The distance to the town hall has become longer. .It looks good on paper.In the spreadsheet.But is it always good for people?Dear Congress;The age's blind faith in centralization; I don't believe that. Let's take the field of education as an example. If you want to be able to live in all parts of Denmark. Then your children must be able to go to school. Young people must be able to get an education. It helps to create life. But what has happened? You can no longer become a teacher in Haslev. Now you have to go to Roskilde or Vordingborg. Next year you can no longer go to vocational school in Maribo. Then you have to go to Nakskov or Nyk√∏bing. And what does the government do? They cut down on vocational training. They want to close production schools. There must be centralization. Again. It affects the young people who have the hardest time with education. Therefore: Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. We warned when you made the municipal reform. You didn't listen. Now listen to our warnings this time. Your plans will push young people away from education. Away from their own future. Because distances matter. If the government continues to drain the smaller communities, then the exodus will increase. And fewer young people will get an education. This is wrong towards the young. It will create greater inequality. It is also wrong towards the business world. Danish companies are crying out for skilled labour. The government is cutting back on vocational training. It is a sure growth killer. good idea. But it cannot fix the problems that centralization has created. Fortunately, there is a strong local community in many places. This is due to a lot of local zealots. And this is due to ambitious politicians. .Like Winnie, our mayor on Bornholm.Bornholm is just one example where it has succeeded in reversing the trend.The families with children are moving there.Wind turbines and solar panels are being built.The butchery is still there.Small businesses are growing bigger, and more are being started and more. Things are better on Bornholm. And it's always impressive to see how much you move locally. On Sams√∏ and Fan√∏. In Humlum. At the harbor in B√∏nnerup. But dear congress; You who are fighting for a balanced Denmark. You deserve a government that wants the whole of Denmark. The government doesn't want that. Look at their policy. Relief in the top tax. No progression in the housing tax. Big savings on youth education in the province. No to the Railway Fund. Fewer wind turbines. The government is pulling Denmark wrong. Makes the differences bigger. Denmark will break if centralization becomes headless. That is why we propose four new tax centres. Two in Jutland, one on Funen and one on Zealand. We must correct the massive problems in Taxation. And we must create jobs throughout the country. We propose as something new local service centers where we can restore some of the close welfare services. largest cities. And ensure everyone has access to general practitioners. Let's look at the municipal reform with critical eyes. It must be evaluated. Does L√∏kke's promise that it would be better and cheaper hold true? Leftists, you were once the party that fought for the small local communities and so that there must of course also be life in the countryside. been a battle between country and city. We want local communities that stick together. Let's fight the centralization of Denmark. Care for the elderly we can be proud of. A fight with centralization. Now I want to talk about security. I detests violence. The violence that the gangs are behind when they shoot the poor and the few in our streets. The violence that they subject the prison officers to. The violence that still exists in Danish families. Against mothers. And their children. We live in a time of great contradictions. Crime is falling. When we look at the youth generation as a whole - yes, they are actually quite law-abiding. But the hard core. It is harder than ever before. Crime has become more raw. Only in Copenhagen's prisons are the employees since January 1, have been subjected to threats and violence 77 times. 77 times. We are talking about people who do their job. And who get a weapon or a threat stuck in their head. Let's stop. in Denmark. But it is some of the public servants who have the hardest jobs. They literally always work on the shadow side of society. With hard-boiled criminals. This year, 43 of them have become so sick from work that they probably won't come back. A short time ago, one of the employees was stabbed with a knife. Violence and threats have become everyday. Their families are sought out. I know that Kim √òsterby is here today, the chairman of the Prisons Association. Dear Congress; I would like you to join me in sending a direct greeting to the prison officers. It may well be that you are often overlooked in the public debate. But we see you. We know how hard work you have. And we will never accept the violence against you. The gang conflict, much of the crime and the harsh working environment in the prisons are unfortunately inextricably linked with a group of young people with an immigrant background. Let it be said right away. We have many with an immigrant background in Denmark who are doing well. Who contribute .I can see it in many places in our society. Bus drivers, pharmacists, doctors and social and health workers. Girls who seize the opportunities in Denmark. Families who support. People who come here. Struggle to become part of our society. It's good. It just doesn't change the fact that at the same time we are faced with some colossally big problems. Because of a failed integration effort. Let me give you an example. Some time ago I visited a nursery and kindergarten in Tingbjerg, together with Frank, our Lord Mayor of Copenhagen. Not one of the children had Danish origins. And as one of the educators said: ""How are we going to integrate a minority when there is no longer a majority to be integrated with""? Copenhagen has taken the lead with social norms. That is really good. But Copenhagen cannot do it alone. That is why we are so concerned that Denmark must be able to keep up. Our community must be able to keep up. In short: There is a limit to, how many new foreigners we can accept. Because parallel societies are not compatible with an open and democratic society. And because I don't want to put our security out of control. I meet many people who are afraid to go out on the streets at night in parts of Denmark .Many of us are each starting to take precautions. This should not be the case in Denmark. We must not lose any of the most valuable things we have. Our security and trust. Groups of young people who do not behave properly. The gangs. They don't get to decide. Over anything. We need more resources for the police. We need the harsh punishments to work. And we simply need to be better at protecting the children who grow up with a big brother , who is a gang member. A few weeks ago I was in K√∏ge together with our mayoral candidate Marie St√¶rke. We met the local policeman. Jens Peter. A strong man. So completely physical. I can almost still feel his handshake. But he is also strong in his heart. He knows all the roots. He knows all the criminals. He knows the families back home. Why? Because Jens Peter has been an officer in the same area for more than 20 years. He himself was born and raised in K√∏ge. He is a football coach. And in his own words; he also knows all the gangs. It's a cop like Jens Peter who has to create security in a residential area. It's a cop like Jens Peter who can help the little brothers from ending up in gangs themselves. We want more like Jens Peter. We want a police that has time for preventive work. A visible police. A police that comes when we call. scold the police. They have been given more tasks. So we must take political responsibility. And ensure more officers. And then I have an appeal to you who have not experienced crime yourself. You who live in a safe residential area. You , who have children in schools where there are no major problems with integration. You must not turn your back on this. The freedom and security you yourself have in the garden and at your workplace must also apply at the train stations and on the dark paths around evening. We are together on this. The Social Democracy. We refuse to leave the public housing sector alone. We do not forget the prison officers. We listen to those who face the problems in everyday life. Dear congress, Freedom and security must apply throughout Denmark. Better conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. And greater security. There is none of this that we can do alone. As social democrats, we believe in broad political cooperation. I often think that it is good for the Danes that you do not spend as much time arguing in municipalities and regions as we do in Christiansborg. No, it is the results that move Denmark. No words. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen said that he would not be prime minister at any cost. But he became. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is fundamentally more concerned with the survival of his own government than with making the right decisions for Denmark. We must never be like this. Shall we promise each other that? Therefore: We are going to the election on a broad collaboration. to break down bloc politics. For Denmark's sake. And because life is too short for politicians who think more about themselves than about us all together. There are two other parties that are also holding their annual meeting or national meeting this weekend. And therefore a special Greetings to both our new friends in the Danish People's Party and to our friends in the Radical Left. Together with the Radicals, we have made many good decisions over the years; we have made great progress for children and young people. We have removed the right of parents to beat their children and raised the criminal minimum age. Because children do not belong in prison. We have fought for education. We have held Denmark's international flag high. Our cooperation with Dansk The People's Party is still new. But the results are convincing. We have forced the government to pursue a policy different from their own. We have secured a better social profile. I see great opportunities in close cooperation. With both parties. A continued green transition. A fierce fight to ensure a better future for more children. New investment in education. We look forward to implementing this with the radicals. A continued strict immigration policy. Better conditions for the elderly. A strengthened effort against social dumping. to implement together with the Danish People's Party. But there is always a but. Dear Kristian Thulesen Dahl; I have now been through a series of negotiations with you. It has gone well, and we have had a good and trusting collaboration. But it is as if you are at your best when I am by your side. Just remember the financial law, where you were lured into cutting housing benefits for the elderly. And that's why I can be a little worried about the future. When Kristian Jensen puts forward a clever calculation. When Simon Emil Ammitzb√∏ll talks about how good it is with inequality. And when Brian Mikkelsen plays 'Who wants to be a millionaire?'. So remember: You have a lifeline. You can always call a friend. And when Kristian Thulesen Dahl calls, I say the same to him as I say to you. We have not built Denmark on top tax cuts and high inequality. We have done the opposite. And yes ‚Äì there is something in our society that is not good enough. Today I talked about three of the things we must do better. The conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. Security back. But that doesn't change the fact that Denmark is one of the world's best societies. So let's bloody strengthen our social model. It's so easy to tear it down. It's much harder to build up. But friends ‚Äì that is the task. We must use the recovery to shape the future. So that it benefits everyone. As the Social Democrats have always done. In 1960 our party won the election with the message: Make good times better. Viggo Kampmann was chairman and Prime Minister. The economy was booming and unemployment was low. Ordinary families could afford a car, television and holidays in the south. Business life was given a good framework. And nurseries, kindergartens, care homes, hospitals were built. Denmark became richer. More equal. More safe. And now we have the opportunity again. We are out of the crisis. Now we can create the next big progress. Progress must not just be a consumption party for the few. Dear congress, We must make good times better. For everyone. And Social Democracy's responsibility. It is to keep Denmark together. It will not be easy. But dear Congress: We are the only party that can. Thank you for the word.

54161.0,"Here you can read Mette Frederiksen's full speech to the congress 2017. Dear congress, Thanks to Thomas. Thanks to Arne and Joy. Three of Denmark's best mayors. And Thomas Kastrup Larsen. Mayor here in the city; as an old Aalborg resident, shouldn't I be allowed to say a special thank you? You do it simply so well. I am a child of the 80s. Here in the city. It was a hard time. Not least in my childhood neighborhood. Gr√∏nlandskvarteret .My mother was a daycare mother. And we often sat in the kitchen. We had such a round kitchen table. There was coffee on the pot. came to visit. When my father's colleagues couldn't keep up and dropped out of the labor market. Rents that were difficult to pay. I don't remember all the conversations. But I remember the feeling. When as a child you could see grown people being sad. That was how the poor eighties were. But Aalborg and Denmark rose up. Things got going in the 90s. The social democratic government got rid of unemployment. The university grew strongly. And many of us who come from families where there was not much education .We got the opportunity. The big social problems that were here in the city in the 80s have not all disappeared. But the prosperity is greater. The opportunities are more. Aalborg is a better city today. Dear Congress: Let's give Thomas Kastrup Larsen a huge hand. When the Danes were asked some time ago to vote for the country's best mayors, third place went to a social democrat. 2. the place went to a social democrat. And yes, 1st place went to a social democrat. First place among the Danes. We have it. It requires humility. Hard work and responsiveness. We will make an effort. There are now only 66 days until we Danes go to the polls. An election that is at least as important as the one for the Folketing. We can do a lot in Christiansborg with legislation. But often our mayors and regional chairmen can do even more. We got a good election last time. Now we have to win even more Danes' trust. Continue to have the steering wheel in the health area. We are going to win back cities. We will fight hard for victory on November 21. Dear all top candidates, stand up straight! Candidates for city councils and regions, you too! Dear Congress , give our candidates a big hand. Dear Congress, We Danes are faced with a decisive political choice: Do we want to strengthen or weaken what has made Denmark strong? Namely our welfare society. We have made our choice. We want to be united for Denmark .And there are three things I want to talk about today.I want to talk about our elderly.I want a showdown with the centralization of Denmark.And I want to ensure the security of the Danes. something with you. When I went to the people's meeting in June, I decided to put aside my traditional party leadership speech. I spoke instead about a young girl I know. A young girl who was doing well with school, friends, and the parties. Everything went well, but the film broke. The psychological vulnerability hit hard and brutally. She dropped out of the program. many of you who listened also thought of a young person. Not just her, I had for my inner gaze. But someone else who is also not well. I simply got so many reactions to that speech. Mental vulnerability among children and young people are no longer a problem for a few families. It has become a big and growing societal problem. Now we all know someone who is not well. Our own young people in DSU have been saying this for a long time. Thank you DSU. Thank you , because you give voice to some of the young people who are having a hard time. Who can't speak up themselves. There is something not working in our society when so many children and young people struggle with life. With themselves. Against himself. And some unreasonably high expectations. Not least created on social media. Of course we can and must do something political. In our education system. In psychiatry. And we must look with great self-criticism at the decisions we ourselves have helped make. But the answer is not just new politics and more money. I think this is much bigger. There is something in our culture that puts pressure on our children. I think we have put too much on the individual. You have become the smith of your own luck. And adversity is also become your own. Perhaps we say too much: We believe in you. Instead of: We believe in each other. The young girl I spoke of has gotten better. Fortunately. But there are so many others. I have not all the answers. But I now know that it is one of the most important tasks. To break the loneliness and the taboos. I know. I know that we must take better care of our children and young people. We must take better care of the youngest. And we must also take better care of our elders. We have good care for the elderly in many places. I can see it when I visit nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. Skilled employees who help stretch out the old legs. Smile on the lips and a strong arm around the shoulder. Professionalism and care. I have just visited the nursing home on L√¶s√∏. There were both good legs (i.e. the ones you eat), brown sauce and red wine. But there is also another reality. Busyness. Elderly people who lie in bed for too long .Demented person left to her own devices because there is only one night shift at work.An old lady who is alone in the hospital and is scared.There is no one who has time to tell her what is going to happen.No one , who have time to be there. Is it really our thanks to those who have built Denmark? I don't think we can be familiar with it. We can start by feeling for ourselves. Do we want to end our lives in solitude ?I know that the employees are doing what you can. With the time that has now been given to you. You run fast. And when one of your colleagues gets sick, the others run even harder. Many would rather stay for a while after midnight than leave a resident who is upset. .And I know that you who sit in the city councils. You also do what you can. To avoid that the savings will once again hit the elderly area. But dear friends. When we want to have a strong welfare society. Then it is not only about preventing savings. We must of course have elderly care, we can be familiar with. Where there is time for the individual person. Those who are our oldest right now are probably some of those in our society who have the strongest food traditions. So many potatoes have been boiled, so many meatballs shaped and so many beets pickled by the +80-year-olds in this society. Don't we owe it to our old people to serve some decent food when the hand can no longer hold a potato peeler? We want care for the elderly where the food smells and tastes good. We want care for the elderly with dignity. It is not dignified, that a grown man has to lie in a wet nappy. We want to challenge that. It is not quality when an old lady who has pickled and baked all her life is eaten by bad food. We want to challenge that. We let each other down , when our old people struggle with loneliness and barely have time to greet the home helper before she is out the door again. We want to challenge that. Dear Congress; Denmark. Three goals that should be self-evident. But unfortunately they are not everywhere. 1: More community. Less loneliness. 2: Proper food that both tastes and smells 3: More time. That's what we want. Can we promise to have it all introduced at once? No. Not in one year. Not even in two. But that's what we want to work for. Step by step. Budget by budget. And we'll start now. And once for Prince Knud. And for Anders Samuelsen. And for Kristian Jensen. If the money is once spent on top tax relief, then it cannot also be used for welfare. We know that. And the Danes know that. That is why we say: Welfare first. And what is welfare? It has become such a word that everyone uses. And maybe we have made it too technical? What do you think when I say welfare? I can tell you what I think of myself. I think of Linda, Sabine and Lasse. How many of you have tried to drop off a little one at nursery or kindergarten? Yes, many of us have. Do you remember it? It can hurt your stomach. I think it was so hard. To stand there and say goodbye while the tears ran down my cheeks. Both for my children and for myself. And the guilty conscience on top of that. I can remember it so clearly. The little one in the nursery. I passed her on to Sabine. Out through the wardrobe. I knows the door. The kind with a handle high up so the little ones can't reach it. Out of the tiled hallway. I turned around. The little one happy again. Because of Sabine. They had spotted something in the window. They looked and pointed. And waved at me. Linda, Lasse and Sabine. It was you who were standing with my children. in my arms when I turned around on the playground and waved the best thing I've learned. That's what welfare is all about. Is there a Lasse to give your child to in the morning? Is there a nurse with time when that person, we care about, get a cancer diagnosis? We can't promise a lot of new money. But we promise to give our employees more time with people instead of paper. This is the core of the fingers-away reform we are proposing. We politicians set the goals. The teachers, pedagogues, police officers and their managers decide how they want to achieve them. A completely new way of managing the public sector. The Social Democrats have always been prepared to take responsibility. Also for the difficult decisions. In government and in opposition. It is in our DNA. But we always remember to ask: What is the purpose? Why are we making this decision? We do not make reforms for the sake of reforms. We must always be sure that we run the public sector efficiently. On the other hand, there were still those beautiful flip phones. Denmark is affected by bird flu. Br√∏ndby's Daniel Agger is sold to Liverpool (he luckily came back). And the Queen announces that she no longer wants to smoke in public. A lot happens that year. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is at the time Minister of Health and the Interior. And he spends much of the year preparing the municipal reform. It sounded so good at the time. Lars L√∏kke said that the reform would give the citizens ""the best solution - at the cheapest price"". And yet it sounded better when L√∏kke wrote: ""The municipal reform makes it more attractive to live in the countryside"". Great words from Lars L√∏kke. But has it gotten better and cheaper in the 10 years that have passed? Have we got stronger local communities? has the difference between country and city decreased? More shops have closed. Fewer bus routes. Many schools have closed down. The distance to the town hall has become longer. .It looks good on paper.In the spreadsheet.But is it always good for people?Dear Congress;The age's blind faith in centralization; I don't believe that. Let's take the field of education as an example. If you want to be able to live in all parts of Denmark. Then your children must be able to go to school. Young people must be able to get an education. It helps to create life. But what has happened? You can no longer become a teacher in Haslev. Now you have to go to Roskilde or Vordingborg. Next year you can no longer go to vocational school in Maribo. Then you have to go to Nakskov or Nyk√∏bing. And what does the government do? They cut down on vocational training. They want to close production schools. There must be centralization. Again. It affects the young people who have the hardest time with education. Therefore: Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. We warned when you made the municipal reform. You didn't listen. Now listen to our warnings this time. Your plans will push young people away from education. Away from their own future. Because distances matter. If the government continues to drain the smaller communities, then the exodus will increase. And fewer young people will get an education. This is wrong towards the young. It will create greater inequality. It is also wrong towards the business world. Danish companies are crying out for skilled labour. The government is cutting back on vocational training. It is a sure growth killer. good idea. But it cannot fix the problems that centralization has created. Fortunately, there is a strong local community in many places. This is due to a lot of local zealots. And this is due to ambitious politicians. .Like Winnie, our mayor on Bornholm.Bornholm is just one example where it has succeeded in reversing the trend.The families with children are moving there.Wind turbines and solar panels are being built.The butchery is still there.Small businesses are growing bigger, and more are being started and more. Things are better on Bornholm. And it's always impressive to see how much you move locally. On Sams√∏ and Fan√∏. In Humlum. At the harbor in B√∏nnerup. But dear congress; You who are fighting for a balanced Denmark. You deserve a government that wants the whole of Denmark. The government doesn't want that. Look at their policy. Relief in the top tax. No progression in the housing tax. Big savings on youth education in the province. No to the Railway Fund. Fewer wind turbines. The government is pulling Denmark wrong. Makes the differences bigger. Denmark will break if centralization becomes headless. That is why we propose four new tax centres. Two in Jutland, one on Funen and one on Zealand. We must correct the massive problems in Taxation. And we must create jobs throughout the country. We propose as something new local service centers where we can restore some of the close welfare services. largest cities. And ensure everyone has access to general practitioners. Let's look at the municipal reform with critical eyes. It must be evaluated. Does L√∏kke's promise that it would be better and cheaper hold true? Leftists, you were once the party that fought for the small local communities and so that there must of course also be life in the countryside. been a battle between country and city. We want local communities that stick together. Let's fight the centralization of Denmark. Care for the elderly we can be proud of. A fight with centralization. Now I want to talk about security. I detests violence. The violence that the gangs are behind when they shoot the poor and the few in our streets. The violence that they subject the prison officers to. The violence that still exists in Danish families. Against mothers. And their children. We live in a time of great contradictions. Crime is falling. When we look at the youth generation as a whole - yes, they are actually quite law-abiding. But the hard core. It is harder than ever before. Crime has become more raw. Only in Copenhagen's prisons are the employees since January 1, have been subjected to threats and violence 77 times. 77 times. We are talking about people who do their job. And who get a weapon or a threat stuck in their head. Let's stop. in Denmark. But it is some of the public servants who have the hardest jobs. They literally always work on the shadow side of society. With hard-boiled criminals. This year, 43 of them have become so sick from work that they probably won't come back. A short time ago, one of the employees was stabbed with a knife. Violence and threats have become everyday. Their families are sought out. I know that Kim √òsterby is here today, the chairman of the Prisons Association. Dear Congress; I would like you to join me in sending a direct greeting to the prison officers. It may well be that you are often overlooked in the public debate. But we see you. We know how hard work you have. And we will never accept the violence against you. The gang conflict, much of the crime and the harsh working environment in the prisons are unfortunately inextricably linked with a group of young people with an immigrant background. Let it be said right away. We have many with an immigrant background in Denmark who are doing well. Who contribute .I can see it in many places in our society. Bus drivers, pharmacists, doctors and social and health workers. Girls who seize the opportunities in Denmark. Families who support. People who come here. Struggle to become part of our society. It's good. It just doesn't change the fact that at the same time we are faced with some colossally big problems. Because of a failed integration effort. Let me give you an example. Some time ago I visited a nursery and kindergarten in Tingbjerg, together with Frank, our Lord Mayor of Copenhagen. Not one of the children had Danish origins. And as one of the educators said: ""How are we going to integrate a minority when there is no longer a majority to be integrated with""? Copenhagen has taken the lead with social norms. That is really good. But Copenhagen cannot do it alone. That is why we are so concerned that Denmark must be able to keep up. Our community must be able to keep up. In short: There is a limit to, how many new foreigners we can accept. Because parallel societies are not compatible with an open and democratic society. And because I don't want to put our security out of control. I meet many people who are afraid to go out on the streets at night in parts of Denmark .Many of us are each starting to take precautions. This should not be the case in Denmark. We must not lose any of the most valuable things we have. Our security and trust. Groups of young people who do not behave properly. The gangs. They don't get to decide. Over anything. We need more resources for the police. We need the harsh punishments to work. And we simply need to be better at protecting the children who grow up with a big brother , who is a gang member. A few weeks ago I was in K√∏ge together with our mayoral candidate Marie St√¶rke. We met the local policeman. Jens Peter. A strong man. So completely physical. I can almost still feel his handshake. But he is also strong in his heart. He knows all the roots. He knows all the criminals. He knows the families back home. Why? Because Jens Peter has been an officer in the same area for more than 20 years. He himself was born and raised in K√∏ge. He is a football coach. And in his own words; he also knows all the gangs. It's a cop like Jens Peter who has to create security in a residential area. It's a cop like Jens Peter who can help the little brothers from ending up in gangs themselves. We want more like Jens Peter. We want a police that has time for preventive work. A visible police. A police that comes when we call. scold the police. They have been given more tasks. So we must take political responsibility. And ensure more officers. And then I have an appeal to you who have not experienced crime yourself. You who live in a safe residential area. You , who have children in schools where there are no major problems with integration. You must not turn your back on this. The freedom and security you yourself have in the garden and at your workplace must also apply at the train stations and on the dark paths around evening. We are together on this. The Social Democracy. We refuse to leave the public housing sector alone. We do not forget the prison officers. We listen to those who face the problems in everyday life. Dear congress, Freedom and security must apply throughout Denmark. Better conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. And greater security. There is none of this that we can do alone. As social democrats, we believe in broad political cooperation. I often think that it is good for the Danes that you do not spend as much time arguing in municipalities and regions as we do in Christiansborg. No, it is the results that move Denmark. No words. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen said that he would not be prime minister at any cost. But he became. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is fundamentally more concerned with the survival of his own government than with making the right decisions for Denmark. We must never be like this. Shall we promise each other that? Therefore: We are going to the election on a broad collaboration. to break down bloc politics. For Denmark's sake. And because life is too short for politicians who think more about themselves than about us all together. There are two other parties that are also holding their annual meeting or national meeting this weekend. And therefore a special Greetings to both our new friends in the Danish People's Party and to our friends in the Radical Left. Together with the Radicals, we have made many good decisions over the years; we have made great progress for children and young people. We have removed the right of parents to beat their children and raised the criminal minimum age. Because children do not belong in prison. We have fought for education. We have held Denmark's international flag high. Our cooperation with Dansk The People's Party is still new. But the results are convincing. We have forced the government to pursue a policy different from their own. We have secured a better social profile. I see great opportunities in close cooperation. With both parties. A continued green transition. A fierce fight to ensure a better future for more children. New investment in education. We look forward to implementing this with the radicals. A continued strict immigration policy. Better conditions for the elderly. A strengthened effort against social dumping. to implement together with the Danish People's Party. But there is always a but. Dear Kristian Thulesen Dahl; I have now been through a series of negotiations with you. It has gone well, and we have had a good and trusting collaboration. But it is as if you are at your best when I am by your side. Just remember the financial law, where you were lured into cutting housing benefits for the elderly.

We must of course have elderly care, we can be familiar with. Where there is time for the individual person. Those who are our oldest right now are probably some of those in our society who have the strongest food traditions. So many potatoes have been boiled, so many meatballs shaped and so many beets pickled by the +80-year-olds in this society. Don't we owe it to our old people to serve some decent food when the hand can no longer hold a potato peeler? We want care for the elderly where the food smells and tastes good. We want care for the elderly with dignity. It is not dignified, that a grown man has to lie in a wet nappy. We want to challenge that. It is not quality when an old lady who has pickled and baked all her life is eaten by bad food. We want to challenge that. We let each other down , when our old people struggle with loneliness and barely have time to greet the home helper before she is out the door again. We want to challenge that. Dear Congress; Denmark. Three goals that should be self-evident. But unfortunately they are not everywhere. 1: More community. Less loneliness. 2: Proper food that both tastes and smells 3: More time. That's what we want. Can we promise to have it all introduced at once? No. Not in one year. Not even in two. But that's what we want to work for. Step by step. Budget by budget. And we'll start now. And once for Prince Knud. And for Anders Samuelsen. And for Kristian Jensen. If the money is once spent on top tax relief, then it cannot also be used for welfare. We know that. And the Danes know that. That is why we say: Welfare first. And what is welfare? It has become such a word that everyone uses. And maybe we have made it too technical? What do you think when I say welfare? I can tell you what I think of myself. I think of Linda, Sabine and Lasse. How many of you have tried to drop off a little one at nursery or kindergarten? Yes, many of us have. Do you remember it? It can hurt your stomach. I think it was so hard. To stand there and say goodbye while the tears ran down my cheeks. Both for my children and for myself. And the guilty conscience on top of that. I can remember it so clearly. The little one in the nursery. I passed her on to Sabine. Out through the wardrobe. I knows the door. The kind with a handle high up so the little ones can't reach it. Out of the tiled hallway. I turned around. The little one happy again. Because of Sabine. They had spotted something in the window. They looked and pointed. And waved at me. Linda, Lasse and Sabine. It was you who were standing with my children. in my arms when I turned around on the playground and waved the best thing I've learned. That's what welfare is all about. Is there a Lasse to give your child to in the morning? Is there a nurse with time when that person, we care about, get a cancer diagnosis? We can't promise a lot of new money. But we promise to give our employees more time with people instead of paper. This is the core of the fingers-away reform we are proposing. We politicians set the goals. The teachers, pedagogues, police officers and their managers decide how they want to achieve them. A completely new way of managing the public sector. The Social Democrats have always been prepared to take responsibility. Also for the difficult decisions. In government and in opposition. It is in our DNA. But we always remember to ask: What is the purpose? Why are we making this decision? We do not make reforms for the sake of reforms. We must always be sure that we run the public sector efficiently. On the other hand, there were still those beautiful flip phones. Denmark is affected by bird flu. Br√∏ndby's Daniel Agger is sold to Liverpool (he luckily came back). And the Queen announces that she no longer wants to smoke in public. A lot happens that year. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is at the time Minister of Health and the Interior. And he spends much of the year preparing the municipal reform. It sounded so good at the time. Lars L√∏kke said that the reform would give the citizens ""the best solution - at the cheapest price"". And yet it sounded better when L√∏kke wrote: ""The municipal reform makes it more attractive to live in the countryside"". Great words from Lars L√∏kke. But has it gotten better and cheaper in the 10 years that have passed? Have we got stronger local communities? has the difference between country and city decreased? More shops have closed. Fewer bus routes. Many schools have closed down. The distance to the town hall has become longer. .It looks good on paper.In the spreadsheet.But is it always good for people?Dear Congress;The age's blind faith in centralization; I don't believe that. Let's take the field of education as an example. If you want to be able to live in all parts of Denmark. Then your children must be able to go to school. Young people must be able to get an education. It helps to create life. But what has happened? You can no longer become a teacher in Haslev. Now you have to go to Roskilde or Vordingborg. Next year you can no longer go to vocational school in Maribo. Then you have to go to Nakskov or Nyk√∏bing. And what does the government do? They cut down on vocational training. They want to close production schools. There must be centralization. Again. It affects the young people who have the hardest time with education. Therefore: Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. We warned when you made the municipal reform. You didn't listen. Now listen to our warnings this time. Your plans will push young people away from education. Away from their own future. Because distances matter. If the government continues to drain the smaller communities, then the exodus will increase. And fewer young people will get an education. This is wrong towards the young. It will create greater inequality. It is also wrong towards the business world. Danish companies are crying out for skilled labour. The government is cutting back on vocational training. It is a sure growth killer. good idea. But it cannot fix the problems that centralization has created. Fortunately, there is a strong local community in many places. This is due to a lot of local zealots. And this is due to ambitious politicians. .Like Winnie, our mayor on Bornholm.Bornholm is just one example where it has succeeded in reversing the trend.The families with children are moving there.Wind turbines and solar panels are being built.The butchery is still there.Small businesses are growing bigger, and more are being started and more. Things are better on Bornholm. And it's always impressive to see how much you move locally. On Sams√∏ and Fan√∏. In Humlum. At the harbor in B√∏nnerup. But dear congress; You who are fighting for a balanced Denmark. You deserve a government that wants the whole of Denmark. The government doesn't want that. Look at their policy. Relief in the top tax. No progression in the housing tax. Big savings on youth education in the province. No to the Railway Fund. Fewer wind turbines. The government is pulling Denmark wrong. Makes the differences bigger. Denmark will break if centralization becomes headless. That is why we propose four new tax centres. Two in Jutland, one on Funen and one on Zealand. We must correct the massive problems in Taxation. And we must create jobs throughout the country. We propose as something new local service centers where we can restore some of the close welfare services. largest cities. And ensure everyone has access to general practitioners. Let's look at the municipal reform with critical eyes. It must be evaluated. Does L√∏kke's promise that it would be better and cheaper hold true? Leftists, you were once the party that fought for the small local communities and so that there must of course also be life in the countryside. been a battle between country and city. We want local communities that stick together. Let's fight the centralization of Denmark. Care for the elderly we can be proud of. A fight with centralization. Now I want to talk about security. I detests violence. The violence that the gangs are behind when they shoot the poor and the few in our streets. The violence that they subject the prison officers to. The violence that still exists in Danish families. Against mothers. And their children. We live in a time of great contradictions. Crime is falling. When we look at the youth generation as a whole - yes, they are actually quite law-abiding. But the hard core. It is harder than ever before. Crime has become more raw. Only in Copenhagen's prisons are the employees since January 1, have been subjected to threats and violence 77 times. 77 times. We are talking about people who do their job. And who get a weapon or a threat stuck in their head. Let's stop. in Denmark. But it is some of the public servants who have the hardest jobs. They literally always work on the shadow side of society. With hard-boiled criminals. This year, 43 of them have become so sick from work that they probably won't come back. A short time ago, one of the employees was stabbed with a knife. Violence and threats have become everyday. Their families are sought out. I know that Kim √òsterby is here today, the chairman of the Prisons Association. Dear Congress; I would like you to join me in sending a direct greeting to the prison officers. It may well be that you are often overlooked in the public debate. But we see you. We know how hard work you have. And we will never accept the violence against you. The gang conflict, much of the crime and the harsh working environment in the prisons are unfortunately inextricably linked with a group of young people with an immigrant background. Let it be said right away. We have many with an immigrant background in Denmark who are doing well. Who contribute .I can see it in many places in our society. Bus drivers, pharmacists, doctors and social and health workers. Girls who seize the opportunities in Denmark. Families who support. People who come here. Struggle to become part of our society. It's good. It just doesn't change the fact that at the same time we are faced with some colossally big problems. Because of a failed integration effort. Let me give you an example. Some time ago I visited a nursery and kindergarten in Tingbjerg, together with Frank, our Lord Mayor of Copenhagen. Not one of the children had Danish origins. And as one of the educators said: ""How are we going to integrate a minority when there is no longer a majority to be integrated with""? Copenhagen has taken the lead with social norms. That is really good. But Copenhagen cannot do it alone. That is why we are so concerned that Denmark must be able to keep up. Our community must be able to keep up. In short: There is a limit to, how many new foreigners we can accept. Because parallel societies are not compatible with an open and democratic society. And because I don't want to put our security out of control. I meet many people who are afraid to go out on the streets at night in parts of Denmark .Many of us are each starting to take precautions. This should not be the case in Denmark. We must not lose any of the most valuable things we have. Our security and trust. Groups of young people who do not behave properly. The gangs. They don't get to decide. Over anything. We need more resources for the police. We need the harsh punishments to work. And we simply need to be better at protecting the children who grow up with a big brother , who is a gang member. A few weeks ago I was in K√∏ge together with our mayoral candidate Marie St√¶rke. We met the local policeman. Jens Peter. A strong man. So completely physical. I can almost still feel his handshake. But he is also strong in his heart. He knows all the roots. He knows all the criminals. He knows the families back home. Why? Because Jens Peter has been an officer in the same area for more than 20 years. He himself was born and raised in K√∏ge. He is a football coach. And in his own words; he also knows all the gangs. It's a cop like Jens Peter who has to create security in a residential area. It's a cop like Jens Peter who can help the little brothers from ending up in gangs themselves. We want more like Jens Peter. We want a police that has time for preventive work. A visible police. A police that comes when we call. scold the police. They have been given more tasks. So we must take political responsibility. And ensure more officers. And then I have an appeal to you who have not experienced crime yourself. You who live in a safe residential area. You , who have children in schools where there are no major problems with integration. You must not turn your back on this. The freedom and security you yourself have in the garden and at your workplace must also apply at the train stations and on the dark paths around evening. We are together on this. The Social Democracy. We refuse to leave the public housing sector alone. We do not forget the prison officers. We listen to those who face the problems in everyday life. Dear congress, Freedom and security must apply throughout Denmark. Better conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. And greater security. There is none of this that we can do alone. As social democrats, we believe in broad political cooperation. I often think that it is good for the Danes that you do not spend as much time arguing in municipalities and regions as we do in Christiansborg. No, it is the results that move Denmark. No words. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen said that he would not be prime minister at any cost. But he became. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is fundamentally more concerned with the survival of his own government than with making the right decisions for Denmark. We must never be like this. Shall we promise each other that? Therefore: We are going to the election on a broad collaboration. to break down bloc politics. For Denmark's sake. And because life is too short for politicians who think more about themselves than about us all together. There are two other parties that are also holding their annual meeting or national meeting this weekend. And therefore a special Greetings to both our new friends in the Danish People's Party and to our friends in the Radical Left. Together with the Radicals, we have made many good decisions over the years; we have made great progress for children and young people. We have removed the right of parents to beat their children and raised the criminal minimum age. Because children do not belong in prison. We have fought for education. We have held Denmark's international flag high. Our cooperation with Dansk The People's Party is still new. But the results are convincing. We have forced the government to pursue a policy different from their own. We have secured a better social profile. I see great opportunities in close cooperation. With both parties. A continued green transition. A fierce fight to ensure a better future for more children. New investment in education. We look forward to implementing this with the radicals. A continued strict immigration policy. Better conditions for the elderly. A strengthened effort against social dumping. to implement together with the Danish People's Party. But there is always a but. Dear Kristian Thulesen Dahl; I have now been through a series of negotiations with you. It has gone well, and we have had a good and trusting collaboration. But it is as if you are at your best when I am by your side. Just remember the financial law, where you were lured into cutting housing benefits for the elderly. And that's why I can be a little worried about the future. When Kristian Jensen puts forward a clever calculation. When Simon Emil Ammitzb√∏ll talks about how good it is with inequality. And when Brian Mikkelsen plays 'Who wants to be a millionaire?'. So remember: You have a lifeline. You can always call a friend. And when Kristian Thulesen Dahl calls, I say the same to him as I say to you. We have not built Denmark on top tax cuts and high inequality. We have done the opposite. And yes ‚Äì there is something in our society that is not good enough. Today I talked about three of the things we must do better. The conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. Security back. But that doesn't change the fact that Denmark is one of the world's best societies. So let's bloody strengthen our social model. It's so easy to tear it down. It's much harder to build up. But friends ‚Äì that is the task. We must use the recovery to shape the future. So that it benefits everyone. As the Social Democrats have always done. In 1960 our party won the election with the message: Make good times better. Viggo Kampmann was chairman and Prime Minister. The economy was booming and unemployment was low. Ordinary families could afford a car, television and holidays in the south. Business life was given a good framework. And nurseries, kindergartens, care homes, hospitals were built. Denmark became richer. More equal. More safe. And now we have the opportunity again. We are out of the crisis. Now we can create the next big progress. Progress must not just be a consumption party for the few. Dear congress, We must make good times better. For everyone. And Social Democracy's responsibility. It is to keep Denmark together. It will not be easy. But dear Congress: We are the only party that can. Thank you for the word.

54161.0,"Here you can read Mette Frederiksen's full speech to the congress 2017. Dear congress, Thanks to Thomas. Thanks to Arne and Joy. Three of Denmark's best mayors. And Thomas Kastrup Larsen. Mayor here in the city; as an old Aalborg resident, shouldn't I be allowed to say a special thank you? You do it simply so well. I am a child of the 80s. Here in the city. It was a hard time. Not least in my childhood neighborhood. Gr√∏nlandskvarteret .My mother was a daycare mother. And we often sat in the kitchen. We had such a round kitchen table. There was coffee on the pot. came to visit. When my father's colleagues couldn't keep up and dropped out of the labor market. Rents that were difficult to pay. I don't remember all the conversations. But I remember the feeling. When as a child you could see grown people being sad. That was how the poor eighties were. But Aalborg and Denmark rose up. Things got going in the 90s. The social democratic government got rid of unemployment. The university grew strongly. And many of us who come from families where there was not much education .We got the opportunity. The big social problems that were here in the city in the 80s have not all disappeared. But the prosperity is greater. The opportunities are more. Aalborg is a better city today. Dear Congress: Let's give Thomas Kastrup Larsen a huge hand. When the Danes were asked some time ago to vote for the country's best mayors, third place went to a social democrat. 2. the place went to a social democrat. And yes, 1st place went to a social democrat. First place among the Danes. We have it. It requires humility. Hard work and responsiveness. We will make an effort. There are now only 66 days until we Danes go to the polls. An election that is at least as important as the one for the Folketing. We can do a lot in Christiansborg with legislation. But often our mayors and regional chairmen can do even more. We got a good election last time. Now we have to win even more Danes' trust. Continue to have the steering wheel in the health area. We are going to win back cities. We will fight hard for victory on November 21. Dear all top candidates, stand up straight! Candidates for city councils and regions, you too! Dear Congress , give our candidates a big hand. Dear Congress, We Danes are faced with a decisive political choice: Do we want to strengthen or weaken what has made Denmark strong? Namely our welfare society. We have made our choice. We want to be united for Denmark .And there are three things I want to talk about today.I want to talk about our elderly.I want a showdown with the centralization of Denmark.And I want to ensure the security of the Danes. something with you. When I went to the people's meeting in June, I decided to put aside my traditional party leadership speech. I spoke instead about a young girl I know. A young girl who was doing well with school, friends, and the parties. Everything went well, but the film broke. The psychological vulnerability hit hard and brutally. She dropped out of the program. many of you who listened also thought of a young person. Not just her, I had for my inner gaze. But someone else who is also not well. I simply got so many reactions to that speech. Mental vulnerability among children and young people are no longer a problem for a few families. It has become a big and growing societal problem. Now we all know someone who is not well. Our own young people in DSU have been saying this for a long time. Thank you DSU. Thank you , because you give voice to some of the young people who are having a hard time. Who can't speak up themselves. There is something not working in our society when so many children and young people struggle with life. With themselves. Against himself. And some unreasonably high expectations. Not least created on social media. Of course we can and must do something political. In our education system. In psychiatry. And we must look with great self-criticism at the decisions we ourselves have helped make. But the answer is not just new politics and more money. I think this is much bigger. There is something in our culture that puts pressure on our children. I think we have put too much on the individual. You have become the smith of your own luck. And adversity is also become your own. Perhaps we say too much: We believe in you. Instead of: We believe in each other. The young girl I spoke of has gotten better. Fortunately. But there are so many others. I have not all the answers. But I now know that it is one of the most important tasks. To break the loneliness and the taboos. I know. I know that we must take better care of our children and young people. We must take better care of the youngest. And we must also take better care of our elders. We have good care for the elderly in many places. I can see it when I visit nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. Skilled employees who help stretch out the old legs. Smile on the lips and a strong arm around the shoulder. Professionalism and care. I have just visited the nursing home on L√¶s√∏. There were both good legs (i.e. the ones you eat), brown sauce and red wine. But there is also another reality. Busyness. Elderly people who lie in bed for too long .Demented person left to her own devices because there is only one night shift at work.An old lady who is alone in the hospital and is scared.There is no one who has time to tell her what is going to happen.No one , who have time to be there. Is it really our thanks to those who have built Denmark? I don't think we can be familiar with it. We can start by feeling for ourselves. Do we want to end our lives in solitude ?I know that the employees are doing what you can. With the time that has now been given to you. You run fast. And when one of your colleagues gets sick, the others run even harder. Many would rather stay for a while after midnight than leave a resident who is upset. .And I know that you who sit in the city councils. You also do what you can. To avoid that the savings will once again hit the elderly area. But dear friends. When we want to have a strong welfare society. Then it is not only about preventing savings. We must of course have elderly care, we can be familiar with. Where there is time for the individual person. Those who are our oldest right now are probably some of those in our society who have the strongest food traditions.

We let each other down , when our old people struggle with loneliness and barely have time to greet the home helper before she is out the door again. We want to challenge that. Dear Congress; Denmark. Three goals that should be self-evident. But unfortunately they are not everywhere. 1: More community. Less loneliness. 2: Proper food that both tastes and smells 3: More time. That's what we want. Can we promise to have it all introduced at once? No. Not in one year. Not even in two. But that's what we want to work for. Step by step. Budget by budget. And we'll start now. And once for Prince Knud. And for Anders Samuelsen. And for Kristian Jensen. If the money is once spent on top tax relief, then it cannot also be used for welfare. We know that. And the Danes know that. That is why we say: Welfare first. And what is welfare? It has become such a word that everyone uses. And maybe we have made it too technical? What do you think when I say welfare? I can tell you what I think of myself. I think of Linda, Sabine and Lasse.

It's good. It just doesn't change the fact that at the same time we are faced with some colossally big problems. Because of a failed integration effort. Let me give you an example. Some time ago I visited a nursery and kindergarten in Tingbjerg, together with Frank, our Lord Mayor of Copenhagen. Not one of the children had Danish origins. And as one of the educators said: ""How are we going to integrate a minority when there is no longer a majority to be integrated with""? Copenhagen has taken the lead with social norms. That is really good. But Copenhagen cannot do it alone. That is why we are so concerned that Denmark must be able to keep up. Our community must be able to keep up. In short: There is a limit to, how many new foreigners we can accept. Because parallel societies are not compatible with an open and democratic society. And because I don't want to put our security out of control. I meet many people who are afraid to go out on the streets at night in parts of Denmark .Many of us are each starting to take precautions. This should not be the case in Denmark. We must not lose any of the most valuable things we have. Our security and trust. Groups of young people who do not behave properly. The gangs. They don't get to decide. Over anything. We need more resources for the police. We need the harsh punishments to work. And we simply need to be better at protecting the children who grow up with a big brother , who is a gang member. A few weeks ago I was in K√∏ge together with our mayoral candidate Marie St√¶rke. We met the local policeman. Jens Peter. A strong man. So completely physical. I can almost still feel his handshake. But he is also strong in his heart. He knows all the roots. He knows all the criminals. He knows the families back home. Why? Because Jens Peter has been an officer in the same area for more than 20 years. He himself was born and raised in K√∏ge. He is a football coach. And in his own words; he also knows all the gangs. It's a cop like Jens Peter who has to create security in a residential area. It's a cop like Jens Peter who can help the little brothers from ending up in gangs themselves. We want more like Jens Peter. We want a police that has time for preventive work. A visible police. A police that comes when we call. scold the police. They have been given more tasks. So we must take political responsibility. And ensure more officers. And then I have an appeal to you who have not experienced crime yourself. You who live in a safe residential area. You , who have children in schools where there are no major problems with integration. You must not turn your back on this. The freedom and security you yourself have in the garden and at your workplace must also apply at the train stations and on the dark paths around evening. We are together on this. The Social Democracy. We refuse to leave the public housing sector alone. We do not forget the prison officers. We listen to those who face the problems in everyday life. Dear congress, Freedom and security must apply throughout Denmark. Better conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. And greater security. There is none of this that we can do alone. As social democrats, we believe in broad political cooperation. I often think that it is good for the Danes that you do not spend as much time arguing in municipalities and regions as we do in Christiansborg. No, it is the results that move Denmark. No words. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen said that he would not be prime minister at any cost. But he became. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is fundamentally more concerned with the survival of his own government than with making the right decisions for Denmark. We must never be like this. Shall we promise each other that? Therefore: We are going to the election on a broad collaboration. to break down bloc politics. For Denmark's sake. And because life is too short for politicians who think more about themselves than about us all together. There are two other parties that are also holding their annual meeting or national meeting this weekend. And therefore a special Greetings to both our new friends in the Danish People's Party and to our friends in the Radical Left. Together with the Radicals, we have made many good decisions over the years; we have made great progress for children and young people. We have removed the right of parents to beat their children and raised the criminal minimum age. Because children do not belong in prison. We have fought for education. We have held Denmark's international flag high. Our cooperation with Dansk The People's Party is still new. But the results are convincing. We have forced the government to pursue a policy different from their own. We have secured a better social profile. I see great opportunities in close cooperation. With both parties. A continued green transition. A fierce fight to ensure a better future for more children. New investment in education. We look forward to implementing this with the radicals. A continued strict immigration policy. Better conditions for the elderly. A strengthened effort against social dumping. to implement together with the Danish People's Party. But there is always a but. Dear Kristian Thulesen Dahl; I have now been through a series of negotiations with you. It has gone well, and we have had a good and trusting collaboration. But it is as if you are at your best when I am by your side. Just remember the financial law, where you were lured into cutting housing benefits for the elderly. And that's why I can be a little worried about the future. When Kristian Jensen puts forward a clever calculation. When Simon Emil Ammitzb√∏ll talks about how good it is with inequality. And when Brian Mikkelsen plays 'Who wants to be a millionaire?'. So remember: You have a lifeline. You can always call a friend. And when Kristian Thulesen Dahl calls, I say the same to him as I say to you. We have not built Denmark on top tax cuts and high inequality. We have done the opposite. And yes ‚Äì there is something in our society that is not good enough. Today I talked about three of the things we must do better. The conditions for our elderly. A showdown with centralization. Security back. But that doesn't change the fact that Denmark is one of the world's best societies. So let's bloody strengthen our social model. It's so easy to tear it down. It's much harder to build up. But friends ‚Äì that is the task. We must use the recovery to shape the future. So that it benefits everyone. As the Social Democrats have always done. In 1960 our party won the election with the message: Make good times better. Viggo Kampmann was chairman and Prime Minister. The economy was booming and unemployment was low. Ordinary families could afford a car, television and holidays in the south. Business life was given a good framework. And nurseries, kindergartens, care homes, hospitals were built. Denmark became richer. More equal. More safe. And now we have the opportunity again. We are out of the crisis. Now we can create the next big progress. Progress must not just be a consumption party for the few. Dear congress, We must make good times better. For everyone. And Social Democracy's responsibility. It is to keep Denmark together. It will not be easy. But dear Congress: We are the only party that can. Thank you for the word.

56929.0," If we are to form a picture of reality, a large number of other immigration-related expenses must be taken into account. This applies, for example, to extraordinary expenses in the field of health, considerable expenses for special education and support pedagogues in primary schools, huge costs for the police, courts and correctional facilities due to the propensity of certain immigrant groups to commit crime, as well as expenses for anti-ghettoization and integration measures. DF has already commissioned that study, and we look forward to receiving the results. But back to the 16 billion kroner, which is due, among other things, to the fact that 30 percent of immigrants between the ages of 50 and 59 from less developed countries are on early retirement. Last year alone, 2,400 more from this immigrant group were granted early retirement. Discarded and written off <U+0096> relegated to a life on public welfare for the rest of his life. It does not work. We cannot be this familiar to the immigrants, and we especially cannot be this familiar to the Danish society and the community, which must be connected economically. It is possible that some immigrants are very satisfied <U+0096> they have received the support they dreamed of, which for some was an incentive to come to Denmark. It is also possible that the municipalities are satisfied <U+0096> because they no longer have to worry about either activation, language teaching or job offers. But Denmark cannot be satisfied. We know that the workforce is getting older and older, and we are constantly told that immigration is the only solution. But in this case, immigration has turned out to be part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Immigrants from developed countries contributed a net income of 2.2 billion kroner <U+0096> but unfortunately immigration with its current composition is turning the heavy end downwards. The left still talks about the blessings of immigration, but without defining where the immigration should come from. At the same time, the left wing wants to remove some of the incentives to look for work, which the government and the Danish People's Party managed to implement despite hysterical opposition, namely the start-up aid and the 450-hour rule. Instead of increasing the incentive to look for work, the left will thus enable a life of lifelong support. The only incentive that is increased as a result of this is the will to come to Denmark. And then there is the early retirement. For some reason socialists love the early retirement pension as a parking lot for people. Originally, the socialist parties called themselves <U+0094>workers' parties<U+0094> and were very keen on people working under the motto <U+0094>Do your duty and claim your right<U+0094>. But apart from S-SF's vision that all hard-working Danes must work 12 more minutes a day, we hear no suggestion of what will happen to the thousands of people who have ended up on lifelong support. Aren't these people a resource? Can we as a society afford to write these people off forever? We must state that the municipalities have not been empowered with the task of integration. Social democratic thinking pervades many municipalities, regardless of the mayor's party colour, and here early retirement has been the most important bid for integration policy. The early retirements have sometimes led to grotesque tales. Does anyone remember the story of the high-ranking Iraqi general who received an early pension from K√∏ge Municipality, the Iraqi member of parliament with an early pension from N√¶stved or members of the Kurdish self-governing parliament from Tilst and Albertslund, respectively, who were also early pensioners? Even though it's tragic, you pull on the smiley face. But it is clear that this cannot continue. We have to get started now. While everyone is talking about the cost of retirement, there is an untapped resource right in front of us. Why should poor integration affect people who are worn out after many years on the labor market. In short, we must have Muhammed and Fatima start ordering something before we take the severance pay from Jensen and S√∏rensen. We don't pull any <U+0094>foreigner cards<U+0094> here. We just want to save the pension. We are trying to make ends meet in the economy. It is lax beyond all limits that we sit with our hands in our laps and passively watch while we waste unimaginable resources. We must have a national effort together with the municipalities, which must get 10,000 people, who for one reason or another have stalled, into employment. Each individual early retirement pension must be reassessed and the reason for the award identified. If the problem is a lack of language skills, language lessons must be offered. If there are abuse problems, we must offer help. The chairman of the employment committee in the National Association of Municipalities, the social democrat Erik Nielsen, is negative and calls for a <U+0094>bigger strategy<U+0094> Well, let's get started! So far, I have not heard a peep from either Erik Nielsen's own party or the People's Socialists. Is it because early retirement is still the left's universal solution? And how do the two socialist parties imagine that removing start-up aid and the 450-hour rule will benefit integration <U+0096> should we have more early retirees? Regardless of how much the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party twist and turn, we will force them to present a detailed plan for Denmark's integration policy in the coming years <U+0096> including how the two parties imagine that a relaxation of already implemented austerities will benefit the integration. Finally, I look forward to hearing how Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal assess the connection between welfare and immigration.

57185.0," The EU must interfere without the Danish register for foreign companies. Right now the EU Commission is investigating whether this is illegal.

56557.0,"The current asylum system is unsustainable, unfair, inhuman and expensive. The current asylum system is unsustainable, unfair, inhuman and expensive. The refugee crisis has become a migration crisis, and if the asylum system is not reformed, it will become an existential threat to Europe. Only the day I visited the EU-run migrant hotspot in Pozzallo, Sicily, 700 migrants arrived. Over a single weekend in July, 10,000 were rescued ashore in the Mediterranean and taken to Italy. On a single day in July, 4,500 were rescued and brought to Sicilian shores. The problem is that only very few of those who now arrive in Europe are refugees. The EU estimates that right now there are at least one million rejected migrants and refugees in Europe who should in principle be sent home. For example, there are more than 100,000 Afghans in a position to be sent to the EU. If you send 100 home a week, it will take 19 years to send the 100,000. In other words, a task that continues to grow and which is proving more and more impossible. Although the number of arrivals via the Mediterranean has decreased, it last few months, all arrows point in the direction that the challenges will continue and increase in the coming decades. Our current system is effectively being abused by gangsters as a bridgehead for uncontrolled migration. It damages both the short and long term the refugees who purely actually needs our help. Here at home and in the rest of Europe, more and more people are taking this challenge seriously, albeit with very different solutions. The Radical Left has proposed solving the challenge with mandatory redistribution of refugees throughout the EU. The problem is that the current distribution has fallen to the ground and splits the EU between East and West. At the same time, it does nothing about the challenge of illegal migrants who risk their lives through the Sahara and on the Mediterranean. Others believe that the only solution is to close the borders, but that alone is not solidarity over for neither the rest of the EU nor the long-term migration challenges. The newly elected French president has proposed that the challenges be dealt with south of the Mediterranean, although without being further specific. The basic challenge is that as long as one can claim spontaneous asylum at Europe's outer border, people continue to drown, gangsters get gilded, while real refugees are let down. That's why it needs to be turned upside down. The current system is unsustainable, unfair, decidedly inhumane, too expensive and also a geopolitical threat. Unsustainable. When a hole was really poked at Europe's external and internal borders during the 2015-16 refugee crisis, more than 10,000 asylum seekers a day arrived in Europe - or the equivalent of 2.5 million people. Of those granted asylum in Europe, you can multiply each single refugee with 1.8 family members. There is no mistaking the challenges of integration, education, jobs and housing. And will probably be a political headache for a generation to come. What was a refugee crisis is now a migrant crisis. are migrants without protection who have set themselves in motion and are trying to get to Europe. And they will continue to do so. Hundreds of thousands of migrants without a marginal chance of being granted asylum make the journey anyway. Fueled by greedy and unscrupulous people smugglers. And the hunt for a better life will continue. The economic development in Africa is probably going in the right direction, but it is skewed. Skewed. At the same time, population growth is exploding. Over the next 35 years, some projections predict more than a doubling of the population to more than 2 billion people. Already today, the average age on the continent is under 20 years. In other words, it is a very large and very young population that does not really feel any significant economic progress. On top of the explosive population growth and the skewed economic distribution of resources and opportunities, you can add the gradual changes in the climate. The German government has assessed, that up to 100 million people from Africa may seek Europe in the coming decades. Mind you, if we do not stem the underlying causes of migration and at the same time control the influx. It looks like the perfect storm. That way, there is no There is something to be said for the fact that many people want to migrate. But that is not sustainable. Neither for Denmark, for Europe, for the migrants' countries of origin, nor for the migrants themselves. Unfair. Since biblical times, it has been part of our human values ‚Äã‚Äãto provide protection to those, who needs it. To this day, we provide the most help to those who are able to show up at the border and ask for asylum. Not since the Second World War have there been so many actual refugees in the world. Yet we insist on to treat such a vast and complex challenge so unfairly. This is for several reasons. Firstly, our insistence on providing protection in Europe for those who turn up at the border helps to create an A and a B team of refugees. The refugees who are able to make the journey are usually those with the most financial and human resources. Meanwhile, the rest remain in camps or conflict zones. The financial resources are used for asylum treatment, residence and integration for the few - instead to be used for food, sanitation, education and aid for reconstruction for the many. In reality, a very unsolidarial use of the total resources. The injustice takes an extra turn when you look at the last few years' large arrival of migrants, who do not have a need for protection or a claim to asylum. Our good intentions with the current refugee system actually lead to a huge waste of resources on irregular migration. The EU spends its money and muscle on people who are not refugees. While we spend far too little muscle and money on those who are refugees in the conflict zones. Inhuman In the Danish as well as in the European debate, it is often discussed which solutions are humane and which are not. In my opinion, our current handling of the refugee and migrant challenge is decidedly inhumane. Downright cynical .Because we accept a system where people drown in the Mediterranean. Not only do we accept that in 2016 and 2017 the Mediterranean has been turned into a graveyard. We do it knowing that most of those who drown do not really have the opportunity to obtain legal residence in Europe. In the Mediterranean alone, almost 10,000 people have drowned. In addition to all those we never hear about - those who lose their lives on the way through the Sahara towards the Mediterranean. It becomes even more cynical that we accept that it are people smugglers - i.e. gangsters - who are responsible for the infrastructure and the crossing of the Mediterranean. Their business methods are crude and brutal. The smuggling boats are overloaded with migrants and equipped with too little fuel to complete the journey. The migrants who cannot pay are forced into prostitution or drug sales once they have arrived in Europe. The people smugglers are not modern figures of the refugee saint Saint Alban who wants to lend a helping hand to people. They run a beastly business, which in these years is more profitable than drug trafficking, and at the same time the smuggling gangs have connections to terrorist organizations. In short, our current system produces thousands of corpses, while it enriches wretched criminals, which at the same time supports the destabilization of the entire region. Expensive Our current asylum system sends a lot of resources after the few, while at the same time it sends very few resources after the many refugees with need for protection and asylum. In Sweden, this year, 5.8 per cent of the total Swedish state budget is spent on asylum expenses. By 2020, this corresponds to 56 billion Swedish kroner per year. This is almost as much as is spent on the Swedish healthcare system. And that is more than what is spent on defence, t and more than what is spent on foreign aid. Germany spends more than 20 billion euros annually on asylum expenses. This is almost four times as much as the total annual budget of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In Denmark, over a 3-year period, we spend as much on asylum and integration expenses as UNHCR's annual budget. It is necessary to prioritize and use many resources on asylum and integration. But we simply have to critically consider whether we is using the money where it should be used. And whether the system is set up for a future with more need for help for more and more people on the run. It is a political responsibility to prioritize. Political instability. The brutal reality is that uncontrolled migration creates political instability and as well as security political instability. When you look at the European political landscape, it is obvious that Europeans simply do not want uncontrolled and spontaneous migration. In progressive and value-liberal circles, they have wiped the sweat from their foreheads that Le Pen, Wilders and the Austrian Freedom Party just just didn't capture power. In Sweden, the entire political system struggles in confusion over how to deal with the Sweden Democrats, who are now consistently the largest party in the polls. In Germany, a right-wing nationalist party has won a seat in the Bundestag for the first time since the Second World War. domestic political instability as a consequence of the uncontrolled migration is real. If the left wing and centre-left do not take the challenge seriously and contribute to tangible and long-term solutions, you will help forces on the way, which will partly use political tools that we fundamentally do not like, partly lead an economic policy which is gradually breaking down the welfare societies. It is also obvious that the enormous disagreement between the EU member states and unequal burden distribution between the EU member states creates instability and disintegration within the union. Southern Europe is economically and administratively succumbing to the pressure. The Eastern European group of countries does not want to share responsibility for Merkel's ""wir schaffen das"". That disagreement will increase in strength if the problems are not resolved. In addition, the whole construction of open borders is at stake. Because as long as migration is not controlled, the pressure for tough border controls increases - and with tough border controls Schengen dies. In addition, there may be a justified fear that terrorists from IS or other groups with evil intentions are also hiding in the flow of migrants. Uncontrolled migration, impossible repatriation of migrants and lack of compliance with international agreements can harm popular and political support for the international rule base on which the asylum system is built. This will harm precisely those refugees who really need protection. At the same time, it will help the forces that are not interested in legal and politically binding international agreements. It is not in Denmark's interest, not in Europe's interest and not at all in the refugees' interest. Solutions The migration crisis is among the greatest political challenges of the 21st century. It is downright inhumane to let people stand by and watch die in the Mediterranean. Although the number of migrant arrivals across the Mediterranean has decreased slightly in recent months, there is good reason to expect that the influx of migrants will continue. Along the Mediterranean and other routes. It is now that we have the opportunity to change the system, so that we both save human life and create a more sustainable and fair system. If irregular migration is to be effectively curbed, it requires a separation in the treatment of economic migrants from the treatment of actual refugees .Today we only take a position on migrants and refugees' asylum access when they stand on the European mainland and ask for it. The asylum system is thus used as a bridgehead for economic migration. This will continue as far as the eye can see, and the consequence will be the the problems described above - only strengthened and worsened. Therefore, the only humane and politically sustainable solution is to establish a new system where asylum needs are exclusively considered south of the Mediterranean and closer to the conflict zones. The EU should, in cooperation with third countries, set up reception centers where asylum claims can be clarified and where primary protection can also take place. This means that when migrants are rescued ashore, they are sent to a reception center that will clarify their protection needs. Those recognized as refugees must be integrated locally in the vicinity of the reception center Here, on an equal footing with all other UN refugees, they can receive international protection from war and abuse, etc. In this way, the reception centers do not become a magnet to which hundreds of thousands will flock. From a legal point of view, it can be done, including being in accordance with Denmark's international obligations, to establish reception centers in third countries. The crucial thing is to ensure both legally and practically that Denmark does not - either directly or indirectly - send people to torture, persecution, war, etc. Neither the UN Refugee Convention nor the European Convention on Human Rights obliges states positively to grant asylum to refugees. So regardless of whether it may be under Danish jurisdiction or not, Denmark can let refugees and migrants have their asylum needs clarified in reception centers in third countries. Here they must be offered proper conditions and opportunities for learning and activity. Fewer people in need of long-term protection can be granted protection in the EU countries that will accept. Basically, it is about turning the system around. This model effectively means that the EU's external border is moved to the coasts of North Africa. It requires strong coordination and a strong EU. The core is that we must cooperate on securing the external borders, combating the criminal cartels that are in charge of human trafficking, and agreeing to jointly lift. But such a model will save human lives, it will save refugees - and the asylum system in the long run and create a more politically stable handling of the challenges. And then we have to have solid agreements on the repatriation of the rejected migrants who are in Europe. If this does not happen, it will harm refugees who needs our protection. But that is not enough. Combating irregular migration requires a real, ambitious fight against the causes of irregular migration. If migration is to be managed and prevented in the long run, it requires a completely different approach to the underlying causes. The West itself bears considerable responsibility for the fact that so many young Africans want to leave their home countries. Our trade policy is unfair, we are masters at taking money out of Africa and sending it to tax havens, we over-fish in African waters and take bread out of the people's mouths, we underfund refugee camps in conflict and disaster-prone areas, and our overall efforts to create sustainable development and growth in the southern hemisphere are unambitious to say the least. Migration is one of Europe's absolute challenges. For the individual countries, for the EU's cohesion and for political stability. The EU's budgets, tax policy, fisheries policy, trade policy, development policy, security policy and investments should reflect this.

54794.0," Morten √òstergaard's party leader's speech at Folkem√∏det 2017 Thank you for the song. I love to sing. I love Folkem√∏det. I love Denmark. Our Denmark. Created by those who came before us. Our parents. Their parents. And the generations before them. Their courage and their actions have made Denmark the country we are today. The generations before us understood that what brings Denmark forward is the ambition to always be able and willing to do a little more tomorrow than we did yesterday. Denmark is a fantastic agricultural country because my great-great-grandparents' generation skilled themselves, got their own land and, with the cooperative movement, invented new ways of working together. Today, we deliver world-class food to the entire globe. Denmark is a fantastic manufacturing country because my grandparents' generation learned to use machines. Today we bring jobs home from China because we can use robots that produce cheaper and better. Denmark is a fantastic green country because my parents' generation founded our energy system on green technology. Today, the whole world demands our knowledge and our skills in everything from wind turbines to quantum computers. Now it's our turn. To make a difference. Of course, we also have challenges to contend with. But the answer is the same that generations before us have given us: - The will to become more skilled - The creativity that drove us down new paths - And the ability to make Denmark greater. Together. Will, creativity and community: YES THANK YOU, YES THANK YOU AND YES THANK YOU, as we said where I grew up. ------- But are we there - right now - inside the parliament? Not really. It's not exactly the yes hat that clicks. Just take the past few weeks. The day before the closing debate, the government presented a plan for Denmark up to 2025. It was met with a shrug of the shoulders by most. But before the day was over and the debate was over, it had been agreed that beggars should go to prison. Immediately. Sorry, will live in one of the world's richest countries, and then the only thing we can agree on in the Folketing is to throw the poor in prison. How small can it really be? ------- No, since I last stood on this stage, the will, the optimism and the unity in Danish politics have unfortunately failed. The dominant slogan has become: ""Let it be"". The political signals are not sent with rolled up sleeves and sweat on the forehead from the political workshop. No, you'd better take a seat on the sofa in the Conversation Room. One of the Castle's rooms that is only used ceremonially. In other words, the perfect place to stay if nothing happens. It is, if I may say so, always at the conversation in the Conversation Room. But the signal is unmistakable: - Now stop raising the retirement age to invest in children and education - Now stop helping people in need who knock on our door - Now stop raising the border barriers - Don't hire foreign colleagues - Don't have ambitions for the future - Don't be. Stop it'. STOP IT'! The 'Let us' parties have created an alliance about things that should NOT happen. But is it now the right thing? Can we manage the refugee crisis, the climate challenges and the downside of globalization by simply not doing so? Are we helping children out of poverty, young people to get an education or worn-out seniors to a better life by simply not doing so? OF COURSE WE DON'T! So Dear Mette and Kristian: get off the sofa - into reality - into the future. ------- It is obvious that we have not yet slowed down climate change. We are the first generation in world history to feel the changes. But the last generation that can do something about them. Should we create a greener world for those who come after us or not? YES PLEASE! There are more refugees in the world now than at any time since World War II. We have to deal with that. Not with jewelery laws, asylum emergency brakes and border barriers at Krus√•. But through European cooperation, securing the external borders, sending back migrants and helping the refugees who need our protection. Should we say cooperation to solve the refugee crisis or should we not? YES PLEASE! Isn't it better to just say YES THANK YOU to life, to each other and to the world than not to?: Well, it is. ------- So let's get down to business. Nelson Mandela said: Education is the most powerful weapon we have if we want to change the world. And I want to. We can do something with education in Denmark. And education can help us. Education can make what we have in our hearts become what we have in life. We have a very special tradition for education in Denmark. From compulsory education, over the university movement to free and equal access to education for all. Built up through generations and generations. In the past year, we radicals have added to that tradition by proposing a generational gift. We ask those who can, to stay a little longer on the job. So that we can invest an extra billion in our children every year. Right from their first steps in our day care centers until they are adults and well-educated. We have also proposed that all Danes on the labor market get a personal education account. So you can give yourself new opportunities. Whole life. But we have only just begun. Because what we need is to renew our view of education in Denmark. Yes, what we need is an education revolution downright. ------- The first thing my educational revolution must do away with are the false images of the enemy that are currently thriving in the education debate - not least among those with whom we thought we were most allied: When did the spirit become the hand's worst opponent? When did high school students and the apprentices mortal enemies? And when did academics become the tyrant of the people? Let me, as the academic generalist that I know I am, say it as loud and as clear as I can: The challenge is not that TOO many people have taken an education in Denmark. But rather that too many have NOT. Show me the society in the world where people know too much, know too much, and understand too much. It does not exist! We need everyone in this amazing country. Clever heads AND hands. Regardless of whether they sit on the factory worker, the prison guard or the white-collar worker. The biggest threat to Danish children is not children with an immigrant background. But a public school which is increasingly divided socially, culturally and ethnically. And the greatest threat to the craftsman and the nurse is not the academic. But when the same majority agrees on a ceiling on education. Ceiling of possibilities. Now drop the fake enemy images. And let's solve the real challenges instead. There is enough to take off. And I see strong allies who dare to say no thanks to false enemy images and yes thanks to education, creativity and knowledge. In the future, everyone must have access to education throughout their lives. It requires a focus on quality and critical thinking. On all levels. S√∏ren Pind has that focus. I would like to acknowledge that. We are ready to take positions on actions with you if you can get the government on board So shall we solve the real challenges ‚Äì rather than paint false enemy pictures? YES PLEASE! ------- Last night Trine wrote to me. She has almost finished her matriculation exam and dreams of becoming a psychologist. She can't imagine anything other than working with people. But yesterday the dream burst. Because despite great grades in the oral exams, the shock came when she got the written ones back. Listen to what she wrote: 4 was there. An even-digit number that I have never seen in Danish during my three years at high school. And even though it's none of your business, I need to tell you how much it broke my heart. Can it really be true that if the valve goes down during a 5-hour written final exam, or it just went wrong once, then you have to be punished for it for the rest of your life? I have met many people like Trine around the country. And many principals who confirm the picture. In every class there is at least one student who is in pain in life. Do self harm. Feeling abandoned. We have created a sick educational culture where everything centers on a number. A pressure to do what is expected and do it quickly. Where the educational approach is not driven by curiosity. But of a 12th grade culture, where we reward those who remember best and read fastest. Those who say the earth is flat if all the books say so. Rather than those who ask if it can now also fit. And for whose sake? The teachers warn that they will not become more skilled. The youth researchers tell us instead that young people get sick. The bosses say they couldn't dream of hiring people based on grades alone, as someone wrote the other day: show me your holiday photos rather than your diploma. The world's best universities could not dream of admitting students only on their grades. So dear Trine and everyone else. The second thing my education revolution must do is an education culture that crushes dreams and makes far too many young people sick. That's why today I am presenting a package for all children and young people in Denmark: Stop taking admission based only on grades and boosting the average if you take extra subjects, or hurry on. It is too narrow and makes us one-track. Let's instead allow everyone to use the good experiences with grade-free 1.g. Give students the right to leave if they need it. And find ways to also recognize and reward all those with the wrinkled brains and restless hands. Should we do away with an education system that makes our children and young people sick? YES PLEASE! ------- The third thing my education revolution is going to end is an education system that literally looks like the one I went through. Try closing your eyes for a moment. So imagine what the first school lesson looked like: - In the parish church. - With blackboard teaching. - Tables in straight rows. - And the back on the bench all day long. And then think about what your children's and grandchildren's school day looks like today? It's scary how much the world has changed. And how little our way of teaching has followed. The smartest people in the highest Ivory Towers say it themselves: The 21st century belongs to those who understand that what we need is: - Fewer assembly line skills - more critical reflection and creative thinking. - Less ass to the bench - more collaboration and co-creation. - Less testing, pace and direction ‚Äì more formation and purpose. When the world changes ‚Äì so the teaching must follow: from ABC to Ph.D. And no, Anders Fogh and all of you others who participated in the showdown with so-called judges of taste and circle educators: It is not true that those who sit in a circle do not LEARN anything. No, but those who feel and dance, create and discuss, draw and narrator: they are the ones who can use what they learn FOR something. Should we build an education system that educates for the future and not the past? YES PLEASE! ------- I recognize that some of the choices I have made to solve other problems have pushed this development and thus created some new ones. All the more so today I also take responsibility for taking new steps that can create an education system with room for everyone and challenges for everyone. Someone is in a hurry to say that we radicals have become very lonely. Am on a desert hike, etc. I say like Storm P: Headwinds are good if you have to go the other way: I refuse to be a custodian at the open-air museum Denmark. Denmark needs something else. Something that neither points to the right. Or left. But forward. Something that is based on our desire to make the world better - and not our fear that it will get worse. Is education the answer to everything? No. But it's a good place to start when someone like me wants to change the world. I am a patriot. I love Denmark. Therefore, I refuse to let it go. But insists that we can do what we want! Idleness is not the answer. Because only when we act do we shape the future. Symbol politics is not the answer. It's collaboration. Because collaboration solves major challenges. Border barriers, jewelery laws and asylum brakes do not. Let it be' is not the answer - it is ""YES THANK YOU"". Because we have so much more reason to believe in the future than to fear it. Shall we get wiser together, all of us? Give more people a flying start in life? Smash education ceilings? Throw our billions at more educators and better schools? Revolutionize our view of education from the ground up? And educate for tomorrow rather than yesterday? YES PLEASE! Should we create a smarter, greener, more spacious and more creative Denmark? YES PLEASE! Should we make Denmark bigger, and should we do it together?

56484.0," A fortunately relatively foreign drama unfolded last week at the court in Aarhus. Ekstra Bladet carried the following emotional report the following day (3.7): The air was thick with flying chairs and tables when a Lebanese man and his son yesterday went berserk on the judicial staff in a closed constitutional hearing in Aarhus"". The reason for the battle was that the temperamental man's 37-year-old wife had been brought before the court, charged with abducting a son in connection with a forced removal case. When a son of the woman entered the room, things went completely wrong. With crutches as a weapon, he hit a female court officer in the head, breaking her glasses. The Lebanese interpreter Maysa Hassanin disarmingly explained that this deeply despicable behavior is obviously quite common in Lebanon, but that she had probably not experienced this kind of thing in Denmark. In other words, is it a behavior we have to get used to? Furthermore, it turned out at a court hearing on Saturday that the son tried to escape out of the window and fell five meters onto the hard asphalt. Here he had to stay until an ambulance took him to the hospital. The son, together with the father, had just been remanded in custody until July 31 for violence during the closed court session, where the mother was accused of abducting a son to Lebanon in connection with a forced removal case. It goes without saying that said behavior is completely unacceptable. It testifies to a completely unimaginable lack of respect ‚Äì yes, contempt ‚Äì not only towards the court, but towards Danish society as a whole. In the Belgian capital, Brussels, an Iranian man liquidated two judges with gunshots at the beginning of June because they had evicted him from his home several years before. Are these the states we are moving towards? Integration in recent years is a mixed bag, and it is characterized by increasing polarization between well-functioning immigrants and a number of completely hopeless cases without any will to adapt to Danish society. On the one hand, we see young immigrants ‚Äì especially girls ‚Äì who are increasingly getting educated and finding their place on the labor market. On the other hand, we see the spread of a thug and gangster culture, which is taking hold of entire districts, where self-appointed gangster city kings demand to be prosecuted as heads of state, and where fundamentalist imams act as a kind of diplomat for the parallel societies, as recently in the case of the closed Netto store in N√∏rrebro. The most unfortunate and deeply tragic thing is that the misfits are still allowed to destroy so much for immigrants with a deep-felt desire to create a future in Denmark. It is the misfits who create discrimination to the extent that it exists. It is the misfits who, in certain cases, make an employer think twice before hiring an immigrant. Wish they would go home though. We do not need those who do not wish Danish society anything good and do not contribute! Immigrants who do not want to live in Denmark should leave the country as soon as possible - and more pressure must be put on them. In the financial law agreement for 2010 between the government and the Danish People's Party, a more generous version of the repatriation scheme, i.e. the resettlement of immigrants and refugees in their original home countries, was agreed upon. A one-off support amount of up to DKK 117,581 is now paid to foreigners aged 18 or over. The support is paid in two parts, of which DKK 100,000 is paid when the right of withdrawal ends <U+0096> as a starting point one year after departure from Denmark. This must be held up against an existence in a country where certain Muslims are opposed to freedom and to equality and democracy. A country where every stroll down the street must be an obvious insult for some, because women go without a headscarf, and because you can risk seeing homosexuals walking on the street hand in hand - but where the lifelong provision from the public works like a chain about the leg... I know very well that reactionary Muslims in several places are working hard on the creation of several parallel societies - for example in T√•strupg√•rd, where a majority of the board of the residents' association has banned alcohol and dogs. Or in N√∏rrebro, where the ravages of the violent immigrant gangs in reality pave the way for the imams to demand a free hand and tell that ""more Islam"" is the solution to all problems. But still, Denmark must be a terrible country for many people. The municipalities should become much better at making immigrants aware of the repatriation scheme. Every time an immigrant complains about Danish society and brings threats or violence, for example in court, the municipal case handlers should inform maladjusted clients about the scheme as a real option and as a possible solution to the maladjusted immigrant's problems. Perhaps the cause of the problems is not social or economic at all, but simply cultural? I know it grates on the ears of many Marxists - but it could be a possibility. &Eacuten things are certain. What is ""normal"" in Lebanon must never become everyday life in Denmark. Troublemakers who disturb order in a courtroom should therefore be dealt with very severely, and a clear and noticeable signal must be sent that we will not indulge in this violent behaviour.

53835.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter ‚Äì Monday 29 December 2014 2015: The assignments are in the queue! Now 2014 is almost over. 2015 awaits. The year starts, as is customary, with the prime minister's New Year's speech, and it always gives rise to debate about whether the government is adjusting its direction - coming up with new plans. What does the prime minister choose to focus on? What does she plan to do? This year, the speech will be extra twisted and turned, because a general election is close. The speech is the last before the election. Does the prime minister suddenly come out with a unified vision for Denmark? Can you suddenly feel that she is passionate about the task? Or will the government's policy continue to have the character of small steps on the ground while hoping for better times? The last New Year's speech, barely a year ago, was in any case strongly criticized for lacking concrete policy and for being far too retrospective. For Denmark's sake, we must hope that it will be better this year! Because there is enough to deal with if we are to take proper care of our welfare society - in Denmark. Take the employment area. More jobs must be created. The government is often happy that some new jobs have actually been created. But if you look at the figures for Eastern Europeans in Denmark, it is clear that the jobs are primarily created for them and not for unemployed Danes. And for the social economy, the goal should be to get unemployed Danes into work. It will also create a greater quality of life for the Danes, who will then be in demand instead of being placed on the sidelines! The increasing number of Eastern Europeans in Denmark has also made it more difficult to integrate the non-Western immigrants who are here in the country. Many employers would rather employ young, motivated Eastern Europeans than many of those with a non-Western background who are already in Denmark. That is well understood. But for the country it is not a good development. It creates even more challenges in relation to integration and increases the problems of creating a balance in the public economy. It is reported that the Prime Minister will talk about this in his New Year's speech. We must hope that she then addresses the real problem: that there is no control over immigration to Denmark. If something is to be done, it may of course be necessary to challenge the EU system. Unfortunately, the current government is not willing to do that. It would otherwise suit the governing parties to show that they respect the election results at the European Parliament elections back in May. It is difficult to reach any other result than that many, many Danes clearly indicated that they do not want more of the EU. A reorganization of the asylum area is also necessary if we are to continue to have a society that is economically and culturally connected. It is possible that the prime minister will try to claim in his speech that the current government is running an equally strict policy as was run before it came into being. We've heard that before. It's just not true, and there are no longer many Danes who believe in d&eacute history. The government's number two - the radical leader Morten √òstergaard - has also made a clear statement in relation to, for example, the Syrian asylum seekers. They are very likely to be in Denmark for many years, and therefore they must be integrated from today, said Morten √òstergaard shortly before Christmas. As I touched on earlier this year, there are two ways to go in asylum policy: the government's way or the responsible way. You can read the Danish People's Party's plans for a significant change in asylum and immigration policy by clicking here. The health area is also of utmost importance. Here, we must ensure that the economy is there to ensure an up-to-date, efficient and current healthcare system. It is, of course, about resources. But it is also about us ensuring that the resources are used properly. That they are used wisely and sensibly for the benefit of the Danes. A few days ago, TV2 brought some startling features about how much, or rather how little, time a nurse spent on patient contact. This was 18 percent of the time, while more than half of the working time was spent on documentation and registration. The problem mainly consists in so-called double documentation, that certain data must be entered in several places because computer systems are not able to <U+0094>talk to each other<U+0094>. Yes, anesthesia nurses at a North Jutland hospital could even say that when they anesthetize a patient for an operation, there are often six places where they have to record data on the same patient. Overall, a study showed that hospital nurses annually waste four million hours, the equivalent of 2461 full-time nurses, on unnecessary documentation. It sounds crazy! When there is so obviously a huge profit to be made in the public sector ‚Äì and even in such an important area as the healthcare system ‚Äì then it is important to get something done about it! In addition, you can appropriately investigate whether there should also be something to pick up elsewhere on this account, for example from the police. Yes, there is indeed plenty to deal with. We know that in the Danish People's Party, and we will, as we do, work hard every single day to pull Denmark in the right direction - even if we have a prime minister called Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who doesn't listen much to the Danish People's Party. We do not sit back and note that now there are at most so and so many days until the Prime Minister is forced to call an election. Because there is work to be done, and nobody knows the election result until the election is over. Now it shouldn't all become politics. After all, New Year's Eve is just around the corner, and I very much hope that you will all celebrate it with your family and/or with good friends. Because it's important in a hectic everyday life to just stop, take a mouthful of fresh air and remember why you do everything you do. See it all in a slightly larger perspective and appreciate and rejoice in all the good things we have. Remember to say thank you to family and friends for the year that has passed. At least that's what I'll do here: Thank you all for the past year!

54486.0," The main message in the campaign, which is led by Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, is that more requirements must be placed on foreigners. Why on earth has the government done the exact opposite for 3.5 years? Why has the government abolished the points system, relaxed the affiliation requirements, relaxed the employment requirements, relaxed the Danish requirements, relaxed the self-sufficiency requirements, relaxed the deportation rules, abolished the start-up aid, abolished fees for family reunification and so on and so forth? How is it in any way related to the fact that an average refugee family under the Social Democrat-led government has received 10,000 more per month than before the government took office? The answer, of course, is that it doesn't connect at all. And if it is to hold together, the Social Democrats must now, right now, as a minimum, roll back all its many relaxations. Next, they can enter into discussions with us about how together we can achieve the things that the Social Democrats now claim they want. Because in the Danish People's Party we will be very happy if the campaign is an expression that the government can suddenly see that our immigration policy is the right one. It is now somewhat doubtful. Especially because the government has shown again and again and again that it is extremely concerned with improving the conditions of foreigners, while it does not take the same interest in the Danes. Last week's message was that resources will be used to secure work for 30,000 asylum seekers and immigrants. This must then be seen in the light of the fact that last year, with the full blessing and approval of the government, the number of eastern workers in Denmark increased by ten percent from 82,625 to 90,875. Then the unemployed Danes can once again get to the back of the queue. But it is now not only unemployed Danes that the government leaves in the lurch. That's pretty much the whole of Denmark. For the government's policy has meant a sharp increase in the number of asylum seekers applying to Denmark. The costs in the area are therefore also skyrocketing. From a considerable DKK 2.9 billion in 2011 to an expected expenditure this year of a staggering DKK 9.2 billion. Think how much welfare we could get for that money! So when the government is assessed on what it has actually done, it is obvious that it has opened up Denmark to completely unsustainable immigration. And when the Social Democrats now announce, shortly before an election, that they want to tighten immigration policy, it's just not very credible. It is simply too thick if they think the Danes will jump on it. On the other hand, I think the Danes can easily see through the political game. Up to the last election, everything could be done in 12 minutes. Fair Solution. Fair Change. What was it all called? It was just about getting the power <U+0096> and after that it could all be the same. The same is happening now: the Social Democrats will say and promise exactly what you want.

54527.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter ‚Äì Monday 23 February 2015 Denmark must be secured better! It is now just over a week since Denmark was hit by a terrorist attack targeting a private debate event on freedom of expression in Krudtt√∏nden and then a Jewish confirmation party at the synagogue in Krystalgade. As the days go by, we get more and more details about the atrocities we all witnessed. For example, that the perpetrator was known to the Police Intelligence Service. He was associated with the Brothas gang and at his former educational institution his anti-Jewish views were well known. There is also speculation as to whether he was motivated to commit the terrorist attacks during his prison stay and whether he was radicalized during his stay abroad. In the past week, many with a Muslim background have clearly distanced themselves from the terrorist attacks and stated that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam. That pleases me and probably many other Danes as well. I had expected that they would do that too. Because the discussion about a connection between terrorism and Islam especially requires people with a Muslim background to take action. Requires a showdown within Islam which ensures that it becomes more difficult for fundamentalists to recruit for terrorism etc. Bernard Haykel, an expert in Islamic State theology, is quoted today in Kristeligt Dagblad as saying: Those who claim that IS has nothing to do with Islam, or that its followers are not Muslims, are simply denying the facts. IS's leaders base their intellectual and theological teachings on authentic Islamic texts and scholars. It is dangerous to pretend that they are not a real religious group. You have to recognize who they are, because you cannot defeat an enemy whose identity and existence you deny,"" So it is just as natural to conclude that you are of course not a criminal because you are a Muslim - just as natural is to state that it is very difficult here in 2015 to find another religion that is used to such an extent as a starting point for oppression and barbarism. Some of the most beastly things can be found in the Islamic State. We will have to take note of that. It is not mad Buddhists, Jews or Catholics who commit terrorist attacks in the West and in the Middle East. These are mad Islamists. Fundamentalists who claim they are doing it in the name of Islam. The government presented 12 proposals for measures on Wednesday. A bit of a mixed bag of initiatives. The measures have been in the making since the terrorist attacks in Paris targeting Charlie Hebdo magazine, a Jewish supermarket and the police. The proposals thus do not address the immediate lessons of the terrorist attack in Denmark, e.g. that the police lacked shooting training and modern and effective weapons, and that the Police Intelligence Service did not know that the perpetrator had been released, even though the Correctional Service had otherwise indicated that the person in question had strong Islamist and fundamentalist sympathies. It should be obvious that the police must of course be armed up to date and have the shooting skills necessary to be able to solve the task. We must also ensure better communication between the Police Intelligence Service, the police and the Criminal Investigation Service, so that we ensure that there is better control over what is going on in the fundamentalist environments in Denmark. Although there are certainly excellent things in the government's proposals, I would like to question whether they are sufficient to meet the threat we face. There is very little new money for the police in the government's proposal <U+0096> and the question is whether more resources for surveillance, preparedness and more officers can be avoided. I do not think so. And in addition to the question of more financial resources, I would like to point out seven matters which the Folketing could appropriately take into account in securing Denmark and the Danes: 1. It was not many weeks ago that the government refused to ban the Grimh√∏jmosk&eacute in Aarhus, even though a considerable part of the people who have traveled to Syria to fight alongside the Islamic State have had their way in that particular mosque. The Danish Parliament has also on several occasions refused to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, which announced last week that the movement will not distance itself from the terrorist attacks last weekend. If we want to prevent young people from being caught in the clutches of fundamentalism, then we will have to be consistent with e.g. Grimh√∏jmosk&eacute and Hizb ut-Tahrir, when sympathy for extremism is expressed from there. 2. Foreigners who pose a risk to Danish society should in reality not be in Denmark at all. Foreigners who come here and have to go through an integration process, today sign an integration declaration, in which they e.g. declare that they will respect democracy and freedoms. But today it has no consequence if you break that declaration. It must be changed so that foreigners who, for example, turn out to have extreme Islamist views can no longer be here. 3. We need to strengthen border control. Today, you can travel in and out of Denmark without being checked. We have seen how criminals take advantage of this <U+0096> even criminals who have been deported by Denmark. We have also seen how extremist Muslims, e.g. Anjem Choudary, the leader of the banned British movement Sharia4UK, has traveled to Denmark to spread their hatred. It must be stopped. 4. There has been speculation as to whether the perpetrator of the terrorist attack on 14 and 15 February has been radicalized in prison. We dont know. But there is no doubt that it entails a risk to have persons such as Sam Mansour, who have links to al-Qaeda, sitting in Danish prisons. Therefore, Islamists who are judged to want to try to find followers for their fundamentalist messages should be isolated in Danish prisons. They must not be able to influence others. 5. We must offer solid and credible protection for our Jewish fellow citizens and their institutions ‚Äì the Caroline School and the Synagogue. These are places where our fellow citizens with a Jewish background must be able to travel safely. Crazy to think that a Jewish school could be a target for terrorism. But we have seen it in Toulouse in France, where three students and a teacher were killed in front of a Jewish school in 2012, and we must take our precautions here in Denmark. 6. It is estimated that approximately 150 residents have traveled to Syria to fight in the war there <U+0096> a considerable number of them together with the Islamic State. They pose a great risk to Danish society when they return. In Belgium, a returned Syrian refugee went berserk and shot around the Jewish Museum in Brussels. In Canada, a man who had his passport revoked because he was under suspicion of wanting to travel to Syria in particular attacked the Canadian Parliament. It is such discouraging experiences that we must be much more consistent in relation to people who want to travel or have traveled abroad to fight against Danish interests. 7. We will also have to have a debate about the international conventions. Politiken wrote last week how seven foreigners convicted of terrorism are still in Denmark because they could not be deported due to international conventions. Unacceptable! It is difficult to find the justification why foreigners who have been convicted of having violated the terrorism section should be allowed to remain in Denmark. Their deeds have told us all about what they think about the way we organize our society. And international conventions must not be used to grant citizenship to foreigners who are deemed to be a danger to Denmark. It should go without saying, but still it happens today .. The above 7 points are obviously not an exhaustive list of what should be done. Basically, it is also about whether we ensure an immigration policy that makes it possible to integrate those who come. But unfortunately that point has no ground with the current government. Conversely, action is urgent. Therefore, we go to the government with the above points and hope for responsiveness. It is of course impossible to issue a guarantee that terrorism cannot strike again in Denmark. But we can do more than what we do today to avoid it. Much more. And it's high time.

53757.0," The parliamentary year just ended has been a long election campaign, but fortunately the Danish People's Party and the government have nevertheless been able to deliver concrete political results. While others in the Folketing have chosen to freewheel. Most of the spring was spent with speculation about when the Prime Minister might press the button. Commentator after commenter definitely believed that now the election <U+0096> is coming and it won't be next week, then the week after. Because the election must come. Yes, it does too. No later than November. I regard the fact that we have not had an election yet as an expression of thorough consideration by the Prime Minister. Often a prime minister has chosen to press the button prematurely, when everything seemed hopeless. A government's primary task is to govern as long as it has the necessary majority behind it. The current government has proven that it is capable of this. We have taken our turns <U+0096> but have finally come to an agreement. In this connection, it is particularly worth mentioning that the government and the Danish People's Party have delivered the best offer for securing the future of Denmark with the 2020 plan. Not all elements of the 2020 plan have grown in the Danish People's Party's garden. Not everything has been fun to participate in. But as a politician you must be prepared to take responsibility. We have done this in the Danish People's Party <U+0096> at the same time as we have left a large amount of DF fingerprints on Danish politics. With the 2020 plan, we have not only secured the welfare of the future financially. We have also made Denmark a safer place to live. We have reintroduced border controls. We have strengthened the fight against rampant gang crime, we have doubled the punishment for home robberies and consistent deportation of gang criminals has been introduced. Many have criticized the Danish People's Party for mixing things up when we link border control, increased penalties and the fight against gangs with economic negotiations. But the criticism only testifies to an inability to think in wholes. In the Danish People's Party, we don't just listen to economists and read numbers and graphs. We think in a whole. The welfare of the future is paramount for the Danes. But can economic welfare stand alone? Is welfare ensured if bullets hit people on the head when they walk out into the street, or when families have to fear becoming the next victims of home robbers? Or when the gangs terrorize entire neighborhoods? No, it's not welfare. Welfare and safety are linked and form the very foundation of Danish values. In the Danish People's Party, the summer holidays will certainly be somewhat shorter than usual. We know that the election campaign will influence the media during the summer holidays. We know that both we and the government will be subject to attack <U+0096> below the belt site as well. The Social Democrats, the Socialist People's Party and the trade union movement have sent hordes of <U+0094>detectives<U+0094> out in search of possible dirt. Politically, the Social Democracy and the Socialist People's Party have nothing to offer. Their financial plan simply does not fit together and lacks funding for somewhere between DKK 15 and 20 billion. It will be interesting to see where they will find the money <U+0096> because if found, they must. Otherwise, the EU will come and knock Denmark in the head. Yes, it is indeed exciting. Do the homeowners have to cope with increased taxes or higher interest rates? How many new charges can we expect? How much do wage earners have to pay in additional tax to drive in and out of the capital? How many new bans will the Danes be met with? If you are into the exciting and totally unpredictable <U+0096> and otherwise have nerves of steel <U+0096> you must tick one of the lots in red block. There are plenty of daredevils. But if you would rather be sure of the future and sure that there will be no unpleasant surprises in the form of tax increases or new charges, you must choose the parties in the blue block. In the Danish People's Party, we have put all our cards on the table <U+0096> well in advance of the election. Our policy is crystal clear. Voters know what they can count on.

56441.0," But right now we see that this foundation is slipping. In S√∏nderborg, in Vendsyssel and on Bornholm. In all three places, it is the Danish Immigration Service that is at stake. Due to the pressure from many new asylum seekers, the three locations must urgently find accommodation. It must be said that on Bornholm it is the social democratic mayor Winni Grosb√∏ll who has campaigned to get asylum seekers to the island. But when it emerged that the plan is for 100 asylum seekers to be accommodated in a building located right next to a schoolyard, the protests really gained momentum. An online signature collection has since 28 July received approximately 1150 electronic signatures. Understandably, because it is unfortunately a sad fact that neighbors of asylum centers risk crime and trouble. In 2013, every fourth asylum seeker was charged with a crime! And the authorities are terribly busy when it comes to getting the many new asylum seekers housed. One could be tempted to say that it would be nice if the authorities were just as busy with all other case processing! In Vester Hjermitslev in Jutland, for example, housing the approximately 100 asylum seekers had to go so fast that the citizens had to be informed via notices. The citizens have thus been informed via notices that their town is growing by 25 percent in a flash. Citizens' meetings and the like, where locals have had the opportunity to make their position and opinion known, there have been none. In S√∏nderborg, there are also strong concerns about the prospect of a new asylum center at the former barracks in the city. It is feared that this will mean that a large-scale construction at the harbor costing DKK 600 million will be in jeopardy. For example, there must be a hotel and a water park, and the fear is that it will be difficult to find investors if the neighbor of the new attraction is an asylum centre. But there is no reason to worry, says the social democratic mayor Erik Lauritzen. Because he has an agreement with the Danish Immigration Service, and it states that the asylum center must be closed in 2017, and the construction will, according to the plans, be finished in 2018. Yes, it sounds good, but can you trust it? If the current government continues, there is no indication that the need for places for asylum seekers will decrease in 2017! So isn't S√∏nderborg promised something that might be difficult to keep? And here we are at one of the crucial problems. It is undermining the trust between the citizens and the state that the citizens cannot count on being taken seriously for advice when the state wants to set up centers for asylum seekers. In the debate, most recently from the social-democratic mayor of Southern Jutland, it has often been said that asylum centers are the same as wind turbines: We want them, we just don't want them lying around. It is such an attempt to say that there are no alternatives. But of course there is. Unfortunately, however, the Social Democrats find it fundamentally difficult to have an open and free debate on immigration policy. It is nothing new. That is why they are trying to drag the consequences of the policy pursued over the heads of the Danes without hearings, without debates. But you can therefore pursue a different immigration policy! Overall, the many increased challenges come from the fact that the government has relaxed immigration policy in a large number of areas. This means that Denmark has become considerably more interesting for asylum seekers. In this connection, we must not forget that some of the asylum seekers apply without having the shadow of the possibility of asylum. They use the opportunity to apply for asylum to come to Denmark to commit crime for as long as they can. So, of course, we must at least have rolled back the relaxations. As soon as possible. Next, we must ensure a reasonable distribution of the asylum seekers who then come to Denmark. Here, there is no point in the haste that is being put into action. No, as with so many other things, it is important to involve the citizens who are affected. Preferably, the Danish People's Party saw that the citizens were simply asked about the matter. In other words, local referenda. But if it can't be done, then we at least want the citizens to be heard, and this must happen in a proper and honest way. As a society, we cannot be familiar with anything else, and it is also an expression of common sense. We must not again have conditions such as the botched immigration policy of the 1980s, which resulted in asylum centers in the strangest places, such as in the middle of the seaside resort of Blokhus. The Danes want to help people in need. But the government must recognize that many Danes do not see it as natural that people move thousands of kilometers just to land in Denmark and then receive massive help here. Many Danes would much rather help in the surrounding areas, where it makes much more sense. Where for the same resources you help far more people. And where you help regardless of the economic differences that exist among the asylum seekers. It is certainly not free to travel to, for example, Denmark to seek asylum - but what about all those who do not have those resources? They are largely abandoned today. Denmark can advantageously cooperate with other countries to set up asylum centers in the surrounding areas. In this way, we can help to a greater extent the countries that in any case have many refugees and displaced people - in return, we can help more, and especially more of those who do not have the financial resources to flee thousands of kilometers! It will also reduce the need for accommodation around Denmark. And the places that are needed will be easier to find - and can be found through the involvement of the Danes in the affected areas. An involvement that is real and where you have the opportunity to speak up locally. After all, the Danes are ‚Äì according to several studies ‚Äì one of the happiest people in the world. We must continue to be. But it doesn't come by itself!

55225.0," Pia Kj√¶rsgaard weekly letter ‚Äì Monday 10 May 2010 The Greeks only have the warmth to be happy about It all began with golden promises. In the late 1990s, the media was full of them. If only Denmark joined the euro, then everything would be fine. Then there would be a turbo on growth and thousands of jobs would be created. If, on the other hand, we said no, the opposite would happen. Then Denmark would be affected by the development. As a small outlying area, we would end up living in poverty. Yes, and then of course there was also all the <U+0094>influence<U+0094> that we suddenly didn't want to get any of. The Danes said yes to the krone and no to the euro in September 2000. Doomsday scenarios did not pass Denmark by. On the contrary, share prices boomed. In Germany, on the other hand, the crisis took hold, and on several occasions it turned out that not even this large country, which even houses the European Central Bank, was able to comply with the rules on budget deficits. Among ordinary Germans <U+0096> who had never been asked if they wanted to scrap their D-mark <U+0096>, the euro was quickly nicknamed <U+0094>Teuro<U+0094> because many used the switch to screw prices skyrocket. However, when smaller countries exceeded the budget deficit limits, they were read and signed by the big ones. But it was no use. Because what could be done if a member presented highly embellished budgets? That is exactly what Greece did. Instead of showing a realistic picture, the other euro countries were offered a picture of the country's economic situation. The bill must be paid today. It is being paid for by the Greek people in the form of sweeping and painful economic reforms and welfare cuts, and it is being paid for by the rest of the Europeans, who have strung a staggering 110 billion euro safety net under Greece. Otherwise the country would have gone bankrupt. But the story does not end here. Also Spain and Portugal, as well as the other so-called PIIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain), the EU's <U+0094>rotten banana<U+0094>, suffer from gigantic budget deficits, and it got here this weekend The EU's finance ministers to adopt the creation of an aid fund of approx. 500 billion kroner under the impression of the chaos which gradually threatens the entire world's financial markets. It is not only the countries in the Eurozone that must stand up here. No, Denmark will also be liable for a loan guarantee of DKK 10.5 billion. But it pays off, both the government and the economists assure us. Because the krone is tied to the euro. Yes, certain parts of the government even believe that it cannot go fast enough with a Danish connection to the cold-sailed currency. Only the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling has had the courage to say clearly NO <U+0096> it is a matter for the Euro countries. The aid fund must be used to help countries that, like Greece, have pursued an economically irresponsible policy. But when you look at the huge amount that had to be piled up to save Greece <U+0096> more than 800 billion kroner <U+0096>, the aid fund seems quite inadequate. Added to this is the whole moral aspect. Why should the taxpayers in a non-euro country like Denmark pay for irresponsible politicians' handling of budgets in other countries? I admit it looks black. Even US President Barack Obama demands action. But why must the EU supporters' answer to problems always be more EU, more euro, more control and more bureaucracy? Never have I heard the magic words <U+0094>We were probably wrong<U+0094>. No, no matter what happens, you will never be able to get a single supporter to admit that the common currency was a mistake, that it was introduced in countries at very different stages of development, with very different economies and with very different political starting points. No, in reality I suspect the supporters of rubbing their hands. For now they can finally get what none of them dared to tell the European population about when the euro was introduced, but which is the only prerequisite for a common currency: Total EU control and unification of the member states' fiscal policy and thus also of the countries' labor markets - and welfare policy. They knew that once the euro train was running, it would be impossible to back off without creating total economic chaos. We should count ourselves happy that we kept the krone, regardless of its peg to the euro, which we can break off ourselves when and if we want, and regardless of the supporters' strained praise of the euro. The crown still exists as an independent physical fact. In Greece, it has dawned on the population that they are no longer masters of their own house, but are now effectively controlled from Frankfurt and Brussels. The euro acted as a straitjacket because the Greeks had no tools to deal with the crisis <U+0096> thus the euro is the real cause of the soup daze the country is in. In Denmark we can be happy that we are relatively warm in bent <U+0096> in Greece they can only rejoice in the heat.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes government appointments, arguing officials favor EU‚Äêaligned ambitions over serving Danish voters.

55082.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's constitutional speech, 5 June 2020, Lykkesholm Castle Dear everyone. Welcome to the Constitutional meeting here from Lykkesholm on Funen. This year a special one of its kind. Due to corona, we gather at a distance. And then we hope that at that very moment we can be allowed to be more together and meet each other physically again. But you must not be deceived by the constitutional speakers. We will hold the event as usual. And also comes with the political messages that we think are appropriate on a day like today. Of course, I also have to remind you that today is also a special day. So I hope all you women have been good to your husbands. Today is also Father's Day. While there are only a few of us gathered here at the castle, there are many of you all around the country who follow along online. So even though we unfortunately cannot physically be together, we are nevertheless united in the strong community we have in the Danish People's Party, about some of the most important political issues for our country. I will touch on some of the most important ones today. I want to talk about the Constitution - our democracy. About how the EU undermines our independence - why we are opposed to the EU. About how a strict immigration policy is the prerequisite for a strong national community that is based on trust. About how we must demand dignified conditions for our elderly. There is plenty to be done. First about the Constitution - our democracy. Today is Constitution Day. We celebrate the Constitution's birthday. We do this every year - and with a solemnity to ensure that the Constitution is taken seriously. But is that the case? Is the Constitution taken seriously? The Constitution provides the framework for our democracy. Ensures free choice. Ensures freedom of speech and assembly. Ensures a division of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. Today, all the parties certainly speak highly of these very basic things. But do they also remember it in everyday life? When the corona virus made its way into Denmark, it was really quick to shut down. We saw the pictures from Italy and had to do everything to avoid similar conditions in our country. So from here there is no criticism of the resolute handling back in March. We agreed with Mette Frederiksen that action should be taken quickly. But after that it went downhill. We have experienced a government that has been more and more self-willed. Running his own race. Involving everyone around them less and less. The health authorities are used when it suits politically. Driven onto a side track when their assessments say something different than the Social Democrats want. Officials are singled out at press conferences when it puts the government in a good light. Is suddenly absent from press conferences when they are difficult. The parties of the Folketing are involved when it needs to be used to show that we all stand together. When the parties of the Folketing then have a different position than the Social Democrats, you simply stop holding meetings with the parties. Then you drive yourself. I've said this before: Corona virus is not an enemy that listens. And then attack in a new way tomorrow because we have talked about it. We can talk openly about how we handle corona. There is no reason why we should not know what, for example, the health authorities think exactly. What advice have they given the government. The shutdown of Denmark has colossal consequences. Especially for the many who have been fired. Those who are at home on wage compensation, but who really have no idea if there is a job for them again. The young people who are to be confirmed and who don't know if they can keep the party. The elderly who lack visits or still do not receive sufficient help with basic things such as proper cleaning. There are so many unresolved questions that in an open and democratic society joint solutions must be found. Not by waiting for a new press conference, where a prime minister just briefs the people, but where the people's representatives, as they are elected, decide. In March, all the parties in the Danish Parliament hastily adopted rules that gave the S-government great powers and authorizations. We did so in the confidence that the ministers would manage them carefully and in close cooperation with the parliamentary parties. We were disappointed. With the knowledge we have today, it went too far. So one of my constitutional wishes for the other parties is that we should move more power back to the Folketing. So that things can take place in the open and so that everyone can have an influence on how the reopening and handling of the corona virus should take place. It will mean taking the Constitution seriously ‚Äì not only today on Constitution Day ‚Äì but also the other 364 days of the year. Our democracy is based on Denmark being an independent country. That the Danes decide in Denmark. But to an ever greater extent it is being undermined by an EU that uses every opportunity to arrogate more power to itself. Even the corona crisis is being used for just that. Most recently with the insane proposal that the EU must take on even more debt on behalf of all of us and then donate most of the money to the countries of Southern Europe. More than 5,500 billion DKK, the EU Commission proposes that the EU borrow - and the majority must then be given to Southern Europe without any demand for repayment. But how can we ask the Danes to struggle - also with a higher and higher retirement age - to pay high taxes - to ensure a good social economy. To keep track of the economy here in Denmark. To then see that countries that don't keep track of their finances simply have to be gifted amounts of that magnitude? On top of that, the EU Commission will also increase Denmark's annual quota to the EU by DKK 6.7 billion. Yes ‚Äì you heard correctly: DKK 6.7 billion. DKK. This corresponds to all pensioners' basic amount being increased by approx. DKK 12,000 per year. It's really violent. And that comes on top of everything else that the EU decides over the heads of all of us. It has simply gone too far. When I seriously got involved in politics back in the late 80s and early 90s, it was largely the opposition to the EU that was decisive. The fight against the European Union, which with the desire for ""an ever narrower union"", as it was and is written, step by step is emptying the nation states of Europe of content. At the time, I wanted Denmark to say no to the political union and stick to the internal market with its free trade. I feared that the EU would become a power machine that bit by bit drains the nation state of its content. Since then, I have only been confirmed in the fears of that time. Also in that a crisis is now again being used for even more EU. So it is at least as necessary now as then to speak up. Make it clear that it is in Denmark's interest to free itself from the burdensome overcoat that the EU is. Get rid of the political superstructure that takes more and more of the oxygen that otherwise ensures a vibrant democracy. That is why the Danish People's Party is opposed to the EU. And that is why we want Denmark to have a different connection to the other European countries. Where we maintain free trade with the other European countries, but where we wrestle ourselves free from the political stranglehold. The embrace that is turning Europe into a round of liver p√¢t√©-stained average sadness. Where the old nation-states with their distinctive features face decline in return for bureaucratic rule from Brussels. If the British get a good solution, we in Denmark should follow the same path. Otherwise, we have to see Norway's way. Free trade without the political union is our goal. We can discuss the way there. Denmark's independence must be used, among other things, to keep track of immigration. DF's most important contribution in our 25-year history has been just that. We fought the battle even when it was not popular. Back then we were seen as some who were not Stueren. Today it is a popular position and now other parties are flocking to say that they will also keep track of immigration. And people and parties we argued with a few years ago, because they thought we were WAY too harsh, now want to give the public the impression that they are the right people to entrust with the task of managing immigration. But do they have what it takes? Or will they fall back into old habits? Will the Social Democrats once again give in to the radicals, SF and Enhedslisten in the negotiating room, as they have done in the past year? With higher benefits for immigrants. With a showdown with the repatriation policy. And the ceiling on non-Western immigration to Denmark, which the Social Democrats promised in the election campaign, they have not even tried to fulfill. It would otherwise have to be put in place in the agreements with the municipalities. Now there have been two such agreements since the election last year - and as KL's deputy chairman has explained, the government has not even raised the issue. Will the parties that declare themselves liberal ‚Äì and not national conservative ‚Äì stand guard over immigration policy when it really matters? Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, who in the 00s resigned from Venstre in protest over DF's influence on immigration policy. Now he is chairman of the party. Is his obvious lack of support for Inger St√∏jberg a signal of where he really stands on immigration policy? I miss clear and unequivocal support. Or what about the people in Nye Borgerlige, who were active with the conservatives in the years when we fought the battle - but when the conservatives quit. Will they stand firm when it really counts? Today there are approximately. 1.2 billion people in Africa. It is expected to be doubled to 2.4 billion. in 2050. From Africa and the Middle East, there will be huge pressure on Europe and thus also on Denmark. In 2015, we got a small insight into what lies ahead. We raised a debate about this in the Folketing on Tuesday. And we made it clear what we think needs to be done: It must be an end to being able to wander through 6-7 safe countries and then have the right to apply for asylum in Denmark. We must reject at the border. And many more of those who have already come to Denmark must return to their homelands and help rebuild their homelands. We must hold on. Only a year-long pressure ensures the Denmark we care about. Ensures cohesion. A trusting society. The Denmark we care about must also provide for its elderly citizens. Provide proper care and attention when you can no longer take care of yourself. Ensure proper financial conditions so that the elderly have dignified conditions. Attention must also be paid to the elderly. I have missed that in this corona time. It has seemed that others have thought; we close the doors to the care home or the elderly home and then we open it again when corona is over and then hope for the best. There has simply been a lack of empathy ‚Äì empathy ‚Äì in what many older people are going through in this time of crisis. When relatives do not come to visit as often as before. When domestic help is cut. Even when it comes to the aid packages, the elderly have been forgotten. Many people over retirement age, for example, have still worked. And many of these have also experienced a dismissal notice. But unlike their younger counterparts, they have not been helped. They have only been told that they could go on public pension. A noticeable drop in their income. And when the discussion now arises about an expansionary policy to help the economy get back on its feet, it is rarely the elderly who are mentioned. But maybe now is the time? I think, for example, that it would be more obvious with a period of tax-free pension than with a VAT reduction. I think it will have a more beneficial effect on the economy. Many pensioners do not have a lot of money - and a little extra to sweeten life with will certainly be transferred back into society to the benefit of jobs and the economy. There is enough to do to secure Denmark in the future. And although the time since the general election exactly one year ago has not been easy for the Danish People's Party, we are in working clothes. We do not run away from the square in adversity. It is precisely in adversity that you see what people are made of. It is always easy to be part of an upswing. Therefore, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you in the party's hinterland, who continue to fight the battle. It is you who give me the spark to fight.

56962.0," But at the same time, other things actually happen in Denmark than meetings in the Liberal Party. For example, Thursday is Constitution Day. That particular day is a very important day in our democracy. We celebrate democracy with speeches all over the country and remind each other how important it is that we have our Constitution and our people's government. That we stick to the good democracy that we have. Constitution Day is an occasion to remind that we must protect Denmark. After all, there are challenges that need to be faced. This has always been the case, but we have usually been good at responding to these challenges, and I believe even today that there is certainly reason for some optimism in relation to our future. The just ended elections to the European Parliament showed that many Danes react when things run wild. We react when we see that the development in relation to EU cooperation is going in the wrong direction. Now, of course, you cannot transfer the Danish People's Party's good result in the European Parliament elections to a general election, but I still hope that the Prime Minister and the government take the Danes' concern for the future seriously. We still have to see that, but we hope we will be pleasantly surprised. Too many Danes have a very real and concrete concern. Be it in relation to areas such as wage garnishment on the labor market and welfare tourism. It is more recent consequences of the immigration policy pursued and the constant transfer of sovereignty to the EU, which erodes the possibilities of maintaining the Denmark that many want. But these concerns, in my opinion, do not mean that the Danes are afraid or anxious about the future and the unknown, as some opinion makers claim. No ‚Äì they mean that the Danes act rationally. Act rationally. Acts on the basis that we must preserve the good things in the society that we have. That we should not let ourselves be tyrannized and controlled by globalization, but instead set the course ourselves and navigate the globalization waters in the best possible way. After all, the goal must be for Denmark to share in the gains that globalization undoubtedly brings, but also to maintain the special pluses of a society like the Danish one. Because measurements show that the Danes are one of the happiest people in the world. We are because we have security. It is our welfare society that provides this security. The welfare society that secures us if we get sick. That, regardless of the size of our wallet, we can get treatment at a good hospital. That we have good nurseries, kindergartens, schools, educational institutions and nursing homes. The welfare society, which provides cohesion and which means that the equality and solidarity between us all is high, so that we are willing to pay a relatively high tax to secure each other. A cohesive force that creates responsibility between people! The welfare society is put under pressure by globalization. If we do nothing about the fact that people can come to Denmark in a big way to enjoy welfare, without them or their parents having contributed significantly first, then the cohesion and thus the welfare society we know will come under tremendous pressure. And it is precisely the EU's current course and the wishes of many foreign and domestic politicians that unfortunately means that this scenario is not an unrealistic scenario of this kind. But does globalization demand that Denmark look like all other countries? That we should just copy the way other countries do things? That we blur the differences? No, we must stick to differences between the countries. It is differences that can make traveling exciting. Experience how different countries have chosen to organize themselves based on their history and development. If you want democracy, you also want people's right to self-determination and thus the right to decide on different forms of society. That is why our democracy and our Constitution are important to celebrate. It is the Constitution that ensures that the politicians who otherwise want to cannot simply leave asylum policy, defense policy and a lot of other things to the EU without the Danes. That politicians who are out of step with the Danes can't just do whatever they want after all. That there are limits to what they can leave in terms of governance to Brussels. That there are things that they will have to ask the Danes about! There is every reason to celebrate the Constitution and our democracy on Thursday. The Constitution is the protection of the Danes! So I hereby wish everyone a good Constitution Day. I am looking forward to seeing many people at Lykkesholm on Funen for probably Denmark's biggest constitutional meeting!

55987.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletterMonday 17 August 2015. Has the previous government starved the hospitals ? Today began with a major alarm in the hospital area. <U+0094>Nurses sound the health alarm before billion-dollar negotiations,<U+0094> read a headline at Avisen.dk. <U+0094>Layoffs threaten the region's hospitals,<U+0094> it was said about Region Zealand's savings plans. In the past, it has also been made clear by the chairman of the regions, Bent Hansen, that with the current economy you can choose between <U+0094>medicine or employees<U+0094>. He has also emphasized that the austerity plans that are underway in the regions cannot avoid being <U+0094>dramatic<U+0094>. One of the main reasons for the problems is that no money has previously been included for the political initiatives. For example, medicine costs have increased, and it has been left to the regions to find alternative savings in the health care system. This is the legacy that is now being taken over from the SR government. Because since 2011 and until this summer, the Social Democrats, together with De Radikale, have had the main responsibility for the hospital's finances. Therefore, all these alarm bells that are ringing at this time are testimony to a hospital system that has not been prioritized high enough. Now it's up to others to clean up <U+0096> and it's urgent! As mentioned, the costs of medicine are rising sharply, and there are major problems with overcrowding in hospitals. The economy has tightened up a lot. I have no doubt at all that it must be frustrating to be an employee at a hospital and know that you cannot do as well for the patients as you can, because you have to run harder and harder and that you have to meet more priorities that go beyond the patients. It must be frustrating not having enough time for patients and fearing that you will make mistakes due to busyness. It also goes without saying that it is deeply frustrating as a patient to fall victim to overcrowding ‚Äì to have to be placed in a busy corridor and feel that you are not getting the optimal treatment due to time pressure. But many of these challenges are not new. Doctors, nurses and regions have been warning for years that the economy has been too tight and that the lack of resources is causing noticeable deterioration. Many of us have found it very difficult to understand the previous government's priorities. That there were no borders when opening up to other EU citizens who applied to Denmark and gained direct access to our welfare society. That the number of asylum seekers could be allowed to grow steadily, so that the expenses went from 2.9 billion DKK in 2011 to an expected DKK 9.2 billion. DKK in 2015. At the same time, the resources for the healthcare system have not taken off. But as you know, you can only use the money once! In the election campaign in 2011, health policy was on the agenda. If the Social Democrats together with SF won the election, a lot of good would really happen, they said. However, many of the problems have only gotten bigger. All the statements today testify to that. The alarm bells are ringing! In the election campaign here in May and June, the health area was again in focus. It was a turning point in the election campaign. The Social Democrats and the Liberal Party tried to outbid each other with promises in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhealth. This time <U+0096> unlike in 2011 ‚Äì however, the promises must be kept. We must ensure Danes the security that lies in having an optimal hospital system. The negotiations between the government and the regions have started today. We look forward to a hopefully good result. Later in the autumn, there will be finance law negotiations. Our wish is a boost to the healthcare system of DKK 2.4 billion. A wish that Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen also set out in the election campaign. After all, the Social Democrats can appropriately say in connection with their summer group meeting whether they want to help clean up after themselves. Because if an agreement can be reached between V, S and DF to prioritize the health area, there is a good chance that it can actually come to fruition! But it obviously depends on whether the Social Democrats are ready to cooperate after the loss of government power, or whether they want to use their role as an opposition party to simply criticize. Today's alarm messages show in each case that the challenges in the hospital area must be taken seriously. That the previous government did not prioritize the hospitals high enough.

56723.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter ‚Äì Monday 1 September 2014 Denmark does not need another ministerial reshuffle Denmark needs a completely new government! Over the weekend, the media focused primarily on two stories. One was that names had to be added to a number of posts within the EU system. The second was that the capital area in particular was hit hard by large amounts of rain. In connection with the latter story, several times during the day the same clip of a taxi driver being transported from his taxi, which was under water, to a dry place could be seen. Isn't that exactly how the top government would have preferred to see the end of the EU cabal? To be helped away from the problems and to an attractive top EU post? Because we now know that both Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Margrethe Vestager have been thinking for a long time to get away from the self-inflicted <U+0094>unweather<U+0094> in Denmark and down to a nice post in the EU. A place where you also avoid having to be responsible for the voters. It's actually quite crazy when you think about it! If the plan had succeeded, then all party chairmen from the 2011 election would have been gone before the next election. As you know, Villy S√∏vndal resigned as leader of SF in 2012, before he, regrettably, for health reasons had to resign as foreign minister in 2013. Quite obviously, the three party leaders from the formation of the government in 2011 have one thing in common: What drives them, are largely personal ambitions. For Villy S√∏vndal, it was crucial to get a ministerial post at all. For Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who came from Brussels, the post of Prime Minister was supposed to be a temporary stepping stone to get <U+0094>home<U+0094> to the EU again. For Margrethe Vestager, it is about the fact that she does not want to risk spending perhaps four years or more sitting in opposition in the Folketing, so she therefore saw her chance to grab a commissioner's post before the government had to be held accountable to the Danes. Parallels have also been drawn several times between Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who after all became Secretary General of NATO and saw Helle Thorning-Schmidt's candidacy for the post of Council President. It may seem natural at first, but the comparison does not hold up in any way. Because Anders Fogh Rasmussen actually sat in the Danish Parliament for over twenty years before he got the post in NATO. Anders Fogh Rasmussen sat for many years in the Danish Parliament without being a candidate for prime minister. Just doing the hard parliamentary work. In addition, Anders Fogh Rasmussen was re-elected as prime minister twice before he ran for and became general secretary. Helle Thorning-Schmidt was brought in as chairman of the Social Democrats to become prime minister. Not to sit in the Folketing and work for the Danes. Yes, Helle Thorning-Schmidt's and Anders Fogh Rasmussen's stories are undeniably quite different. Now it was Margrethe Vestager who got an EU post. Good for her, but not good for Denmark. Because the government has chosen to bet on one of the most EU-enthusiastic politicians in the Danish Parliament. That I say that, she will probably just take it as a big compliment. During the People's Assembly on Bornholm in June, Margrethe Vestager said, among other things: <U+0094>I am neither anxious about Europe nor about common European solutions. And that is why I believe, without hesitation or reservation, that we must be a permanent and active part of the European community<U+0094>. In other words, the EU train just has to leave and Denmark must also go with the places where we currently have reservations. The euro, the legal area with common immigration rules, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdefence, etc. We also saw from the results of the elections to the European Parliament in May that there is massive skepticism among the Danes, but Margrethe Vestager does not take notice of that skepticism. In other words, Denmark's representative in the important engine room in the EU is now still a person who is a big supporter of much more EU. Nothing learned <U+0096> unfortunately! It is also worth noting that negotiations on a new arrangement for Great Britain will soon begin. Here, the new chairman of the council, Donald Tusk, has already made it clear that work must be done to keep the British in the EU. It bodes well for the will to find a solution that the British can accept. For Denmark, it should be obvious that we must pay close attention to this work and give the Danes an opportunity to follow the British. Unfortunately, for the next five years, Denmark will have a commissioner who does not believe that the Danes should have this opportunity. Much will certainly be written about the weekend's political antics. About the game of chairs in the EU and why it ended the way it did. But the status here at home is that the Prime Minister is still called Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and that she must now embark on yet another government reshuffle. We've probably had a lot of them by now. At a minimum, a new tax minister is needed, and exactly that ministry has developed into a place of passage. The fifth tax minister in just three years testifies that this ministry has not been a high priority in the government. It is not good. Because if proper management is to be ensured, there is no point in constantly changing the person in charge. And even in an area like SKAT, where we know there have been and are major problems. So the status after the weekend: What Denmark needs is not another ministerial reshuffle. No - it's a brand new government!

56825.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech, Danish People's Party's 20th anniversary meeting, Jyske Bank Boxen, Herning, 19 September 2015. The spoken word applies. You know what we stand for When a three-hour Danish high school class on Bornholm in the d&eacute degree in a small , quickly made film can capture what the Danish People's Party is and is about, then there is justified hope for a good, great and bright future for Denmark! I already saw the film at the Folkem√∏det on Bornholm this summer in the middle of the election campaign. Even then I touched and impressed. Touched because I could feel the Danish People's Party, I could feel all of us and our politics, in the little film. And impressed because the good high school students so quickly and so effectively captured and presented what the Danish People's Party really is .Those students in that high school class,.. They know what we stand for. There hasn't been much to be happy about in recent weeks. Sometimes it's just really boring <U+0096> said in good Jutland < U+0096> to be right. We have long said that the lax and irresponsible handling of border control around Europe, to say the least, would cause disasters. It has! We were unfortunately right. For even longer we have said that the closure of the Danish border control in 2001 was irresponsible and would cause problems. We have also been more right than we care about! And finally, we have long said that aid to the nearby areas from which people otherwise flee should be increased. I reverse that everything back to. But first a very warm welcome to the Danish People's Party's Annual Meeting here in Jyske Bank Boxen! It is a new and somewhat different setting for us. This venue can accommodate 15,000 happy concert participants and has provided settings for concerts with names such as Lady Gaga and Elton John. Here, too, you could hear roars of jubilation from the rafters when both the women's handball and the men's handball have played. And the wildest thing is. The place where you are sitting now was filled with water in December 2013, because the European Championships in Swimming were held. You could ask a bit cheekily why Danmarks Radio could not also use this arena for the international Melodi Grand Prix. It would probably have saved them some money. When we had to deal with whether we could hold the Jubilee Year Meeting here, it was full up with sand and dirt and roaring motorbikes. Super Cross 2015 was to be held. What a place! There are not quite 15,000 of us and we don't have motorbikes in here. Somewhere out by the Skagenshusene, by the caf√© area, there is probably a bit of sand But! We are 1,600 participants here this year! It's not just a record, It's overwhelming. In fact, we are 1,657 including the press today. It's not new that more and more as the years have gone by in our 20-year history have participated in our annual meetings. However, I would like to say, in the usual way of dampening expectations, that next year it will probably not be bigger. After all. I know that some of you have registered just this year, because the anniversary join in the celebration. You are most welcome. And if you think that it should be a habit to come to the annual meeting, then just come again next year! We'll probably find a place! But this year we are 1,600 and I think we should promise each other that we should have a few lovely days with space for lots of political debate but also space to cultivate our community and commemorate 20 years with DF. Almost everyone is also with us tonight for <U+ 0094>the evening of the party<U+0094>. And if the price for so many taking part is that tomorrow we have extra sore legs after the dance <U+0096> and maybe also a little extra sore heads <U+0096> then take for all of you who are attending for the first time, and there are many of you this year, this is guaranteed to be an experience you will not soon forget. This is always the case with the first annual meeting you attend to. And this year extra music, entertainment and fun have been arranged to mark and celebrate the 20 years in which the Danish People's Party has influenced Danish politics. Happy annual meeting to all! All of you here in the Hall know what we stand for. And you know that we will continue to influence Danish politics with our clear positions! This is what we are here for. This is what the Danes rightly expect from us. First of all, Europe must secure and control its external borders! There are those who want to say that you cannot do that.. There are those who want to say that we cannot know. Journalists who report from Hungary's border as if border guards are rascals and bandits and stone-throwing young attackers are freedom heroes. UN<U+0092>'s Ban Ki Moon who accuses Hungary of treating people unacceptable. Is it the stone-throwing youths he is thinking of? Let me just state it: Hungary can be criticized for a lot. But from here they face no criticism that they secure their borders. Every country has the right to defend its borders and decide who you want to open the doors to! The EU<U+0092>'s, and thus Denmark's, challenges basically come from two things: First, almost 15 years ago, national border controls were dropped. In return, they agreed on a strong external border control at Europe's borders. In the Danish People's Party we already knew in 2001 that it was a round of political parade talk. It wouldn't work. And it hasn't either. And now the problems are growing over Europe. The second reason is German and her name is Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel decided two weeks ago to open Germany's borders wide open. But Germany knew very well that part of the challenge was being passed on to other countries <U+0096> including Denmark. For many of those people , who came to Germany, was not registered..Germany therefore bears a heavy responsibility for having signaled with its wobbly course to everyone who wants to come to Europe that now the door is wide open Real refugees in need <U+0096> but unfortunately also people who would very much like to exchange poor living conditions in the Middle East or North Africa for a better life in Scandinavia. It is of course difficult to blame these people for living the dream, but that is not the way forward and we must say no .Denmark must, secondly, reintroduce border controls. And it is urgent! I have heard the other parties almost take turns saying that <U+0094>border controls do not work<U+0094>, so it is not <U+0094>a way to go<U+0094> as they say. But what do they want? When people suddenly come in droves who refuse to be registered and shout that they don't want to be here. And we know that some of them are picked up by immigrant gangs Let me put it this way: it has been ugly to see that foreigners, as long as they are numerous enough and push hard enough at the border, can force a police leadership to its knees and a government to shake its hands. And that has also been unpleasant to hear that <U+0094>everything has happened according to the book<U+0094> and what else the government has now said about the matter. The fact is that what has happened for years since Denmark's Schengen entry in 2001 suddenly became extra visible, because it was about so many people in such a short time. And now they just stopped stopping the trains at the border, so that the flow of people is not a daily media story. Now they are talking about something else < U+0096> but the problem is the same. At the Social Democratic Party, chairman Mette Frederiksen has largely been silent and flown as much as possible under the radar. It seems as if she is thinking: <U+0094> Ha, now L√∏kke has a problem! He has to get out of it himself.<U+0094> Her about it. If it is modern accountability in the Social Democracy in the fall of 2015, then she has to about it. But many proposals for solutions have probably not come from there !It has become so fashionable in politics to say that you want to say <U+0094>clearly<U+0094> something or other. So I want to say clear, so that it can be heard in Aalborg, where the Social Democrats hold Congress these days: Dear Mette Frederiksen. It was you who removed the border control that we agreed four years ago with the then VK government should be reintroduced. It was you who boasted that it was as good as the first , you did, after the general election in 2011. It was you who, with your politics, caused more foreigners to come here on your watch in the past four years, including by significantly higher benefits for those who came here. You have a responsibility .There is a bill to pay. Now is not the time to fly under the radar. The time has come to face your responsibilities! I hope you can see that now, when Germany, of all!<U+0096> and the Netherlands and Poland <U+0096> and more are on the way - have tightened border controls, that it is a clear Danish interest to reintroduce Danish border controls. Even in today's Folketing and on top of a few weeks' experience with extra pressure on the border, the Danish People's Party is still the only party in Christiansborg that insists on border control. And even though we are 37 members of the Folketing against 142 <U+0096> a slightly uneven fight <U+ 0096> then we'll keep going. And you know what? I think time is working for us. And that's why I can also safely promise you and our many voters from June: What we meant before the election <U+0096> also in this area <U+0096> that's what we also mean here after the election: And that means that we won't stop the work of reintroducing border control until it's completed. We WANT control of Denmark's borders! But we also need more than that! In Denmark, we must COMPLETELY reorganize our asylum policy. We must do this completely fundamentally and comprehensively. We must rethink it. It is good that here, after the election, we have tackled parts of the immigration policy. Among other things, we have reduced the benefits that get when you come to Denmark. But we have to move on! That is why last week I called for a national compromise on how we help more real refugees for the money we spend and how we simultaneously ensure the preservation of the Denmark we know .A safe Denmark for all Danes.A Denmark for the foreigners we choose to allow access to, and who can positively contribute to developing Denmark.A Denmark where we continue to have resources for care and help, where we have resources for to develop the core welfare for the sick and the elderly and the vulnerable. Where there is safety! That is why the Danish People's Party is here: To keep Denmark Danish. To secure the welfare society that generations before us have built. To preserve a society, where we basically move in safety and can trust each other. For a number of years there has been an inappropriate mixing of immigration policy and asylum policy. Refugees on temporary residence have been treated as immigrants <U+0096> they have been given three-year integration programmes, Danish courses and legal requirements for housing. All helped along by parties and employer organizations who seem to think that refugees will make a fantastic contribution to the labor market. But that's not how it works in practice! For the numbers we know, it contradicts : A study by the Danish Employers' Association from March shows that, for example, among the Syrians who have immigrated to Denmark in recent years, only about 13 per cent are in work after 4 years in Denmark, while the employment rate of Iraqis and Iranians is actually slightly higher. By comparison, the Danes' employment rate is around 80. And the entire focus has been on integration, not on them going back home when the opportunity is otherwise there. It's not enough! Refugees who come here must not be integrated, they are not to be in years-long integration processes ‚Äì and their legal claim to housing <U+0096>, which means they come to the front of the housing queue ‚Äì must be removed. Refugees who come to Denmark must return home as soon as the conditions in their home countries or nearby areas make it possible .For some it will go quickly, for others it may take years. While they are in Denmark, they must live in asylum centers run by the state. Danes who are in need of help.. If we do the restructuring that we are proposing, we will ensure that refugees know that here in Denmark they can find shelter from persecution, war and destruction. But they cannot get permanent residence, they will not part of Denmark, our country is not a new, permanent destination for them. We do not know if the development means that we will receive more refugees for a period of time. But if our reorganization is carried out, it is probably doubtful. When the conditions improve for human traffickers and all the people who are not really fleeing, but who take advantage of the existing refugee situation to exchange a sad and difficult life in Africa or the Middle East for a better one in Denmark, they probably won't apply here. It doesn't work to be temporary protection, these people are looking for, although that would probably be desirable enough for many refugees. to Scandinavia. Maybe have stayed in one of these countries for several years. Are you a refugee when you finally get to Denmark? No <U+0096> not in my eyes! And while we in this country focus on the arrivals, we are leaving behind millions of genuine refugees who have no money to pay human traffickers, but who are sitting with their families in refugee camps in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Camps where the UN has, for inexplicable reasons, drastically cut aid to food stamps .The people in the camps are going to starve. Those who come up here by train and taxi, the first thing they ask for is power for their iPhones. It was with this paradox in focus that last week I called on the rest of the Danish Parliament to a national compromise, where we agreed across the board on partly a new, strict asylum policy, partly on sending significantly more money to the neighboring areas. In fact, so much that: Denmark will be the world's largest contributor to the neighboring areas! It is part of our Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we help people in need. We Danes have always done that. It has also always been part of the Danish People's Party's policy. That is why we must increase support for the surrounding areas. We would like to see Denmark < U+0096> in relation to its size ‚Äì is one of the biggest contributors in the whole world. D&eacutet wants to emphasize that we mean it seriously. It will show that when we change the conditions for people who come here <U+0096> stop integrating and instead help temporarily <U+0096> yes, in return we will significantly increase support for the surrounding areas. And that will give Denmark and the government weight in the UN and the EU and vis-a-vis oil-rich states not just to propose but to demand, that they also step up the aid! And then it really comes to bat! We help the most by helping those where most still are. In their home countries or in the surrounding areas. Whether we help seven, 10 or 20 more per krone by helping them d&eacuter and not here, is really subordinate. It is a dispute about numbers, which you can argue about for a long time. But that it is many more people we help for every krone we spend, no one doubts .And let's once and for all put an end to the fact that this is a discussion about whether you are good or evil. Whether you are charitable or not. Enhedslisten, SF and the Radicals must fight with each other about who is the most pure for Our Lord and who most quickly and most effectively hurts Denmark socially, politically, culturally and economically by throwing out their arms and inviting everyone up here <U+0096> refugees and migrants among them.<U+0094>Kombardo<U+0094> !While they are fighting about it, I suggest that all other parties solve this in a way that both secures Denmark and the Danes in the future and effectively helps more of the people who are in need. Help in the nearby areas works. Was anyone in doubt, Weekendavisen documented it in an article last Friday. A report from two universities in Great Britain and the USA documents that refugees stay in the areas to a greater extent when sufficient help is available, and that the prosperity of the areas increases - also after peace has been re-established, the camps are closed and the Red Cross has gone home. It must be said to be a win-win-win situation J We must ensure that the society we have been handed down from previous generations and which we value so much on, can be preserved and defended. This can only be done if we both ensure a strong business community that can earn the money home and at the same time are careful about how we use the money. And in relation to the first, let me emphasize that for the Danish People's Party there is no doubt at all that we must ensure good conditions for growth and production. We must ensure that entrepreneurs find it fun to start up in Denmark. That you are not overburdened by administrative requirements, that you can get financing .And we must establish a framework for production in Denmark, which is not miles away from the countries we compete with. rapid conversion to especially wind energy, which has taken place in recent years. This also applies to special professions which are particularly needy and which need quick political attention. For example, it is urgent to implement the 16-point plan for the agricultural sector, which we previously the election agreed with the Liberals, the Liberal Alliance and the conservatives. Otherwise, even more farmers will succumb. We cannot let that happen. We must ensure a better balance between the big cities and the rural areas. Between east and west. Denmark must fit together properly. We is a <U+0096> geographically small country, so it should certainly be possible to create growth and good living conditions everywhere in the country. But this requires targeted political decisions. The Danish People's Party must be known as a party that zealously throws itself into in the fight for the core welfare <U+0096> the conditions, health, security of the elderly. But also as a party that never doubts how values ‚Äã‚Äãare created. Who earns the money. The money that we can talk about afterwards, how we best distribute in our welfare society. And when we talk about distribution, as you know, you can only use the same kroner once. And we have to choose: welfare, safety and trust? Or money wasted on failed and hopeless integration, language courses and expensive housing? We want to ensure a dignified and safe old age for our elderly citizens. There will be more of them in the coming years. They deserve a good life. And we want to ensure that Danes who fall ill can safely count on the fact that there is room at the doctor and in the hospital and that they will receive the best treatment. Therefore, a few words about that. Elderly citizens and their well-being is a political an area which has always had a very central position in the heart of the Danish People's Party. Under the SR government, the elderly area had difficult conditions. In Helle Thorning-Schmidt's first opening speech in the Folketing in autumn 2011, when she had become Prime Minister, the elderly were not mentioned with the only words. In her subsequent New Year's speech, there was a single sentence about the elderly. And then the style was set. It was just not a priority area for the SR government. The municipalities got less money to do good with, despite promises to the contrary. Many municipalities had to therefore cutting down on the elderly, and this has been felt both by the individual elderly, by their relatives and not least by the employees. We must ask ourselves: Is this how we want our care for the elderly to look in the future? Can we really offer our elderly, who have struggled all their lives, such treatment? NO, we can't and shouldn't! We must have the elderly area back on the political agenda. We must create security in elderly care, so that our elderly can look forward to old age with greater joy .We know that safe and well-functioning care for the elderly is one of the most important cornerstones of the Danish welfare society. We MUST restore dignity in care for the elderly. And what does that entail? right to self-determination, self-worth and way of life. This is called a guarantee of dignity, and this has been successfully worked on in our neighboring countries. Here at home, the Elderly has long wanted this on the political agenda. This autumn, we will work to get a guarantee of dignity into Danish care for the elderly. feel safe and have a meaningful life, even though you may be impaired and need daily help. Shouldn't you have the right to get the necessary help for personal hygiene so that you are not sitting in a used nappy? Yes, you do !Shouldn't you ensure the joy of the meal, so that you also increase the appetite of the elderly? Yes, of course!Shouldn't you have help getting out of your home if you want to go for a walk, so that you don't sit isolated inside all day? Yes, you have to! And shouldn't you have the opportunity to be present and talk about what matters to the individual? And respect for privacy and personal boundaries? Yes, that's how we want it in Denmark! But in order to ensure that, of course, resources must be set aside for it. Partly by ensuring that the government's so-called reprioritization contribution does not end up taking money from the municipalities. we reject negative growth in the municipalities, which the reprioritization contribution could otherwise result in. And concretely, the Danish People's Party wants to reintroduce the elderly billion to the country's municipalities this autumn. And it must be a REAL elderly billion, which goes directly to the elderly area and not to fill gaps in other areas in the municipal fund. We would like to call it a billion of dignity. The billion of dignity must ensure more warm hands and more time for the individual elderly. And it must also ensure that there is a special focus on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdementia. A disease that affects more and more people. Yes, there are we have a lot to achieve in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly, and we are very much looking forward to now really getting started on the work! When we talk about our welfare society, that we can feel safe, then it is a cornerstone that we can have trust to our healthcare system. That we know that if the accident is over, we get sick, someone in the family gets sick, then we get the right help. Then we have the best chance of getting well again, and that under dignified and good conditions relationship. But do we feel so safe? Do we feel that the healthcare system is good enough? Many are well helped and are happy with the treatment provided by the many skilled people in our healthcare system. Thank God, there is great satisfaction among many of those who are got through a course of treatment. But we also have challenges. Statistics Denmark recently asked the Danes, and only 6 out of 10 answered that they feel safe being in the healthcare system. We must and can do better. In the first four months of this year, for example, 1,109 patients had to spend the night in hallway areas in Region Zealand's hospitals. So there were 1,109 people who did not have a fixed living room to be in, where they could get a good night's sleep and the rest that is so necessary when you have problems with your health. The chairman of Danish Patients, Lars Engberg, said in this connection. And I quote: <U+0094> It is indecent that nothing is being done. Now it is at least the third year in a row where there is more or less permanent overcrowding .It has almost become the norm for patients to lie in the corridors<U+0094>. Yes! That is completely true. It is obscene! So it is not only obscene that there are not enough beds in the hospitals, it is also dangerous .Because it leads to errors in the treatment and excess mortality among the patients. That is why it is the highest priority for us that we do something about this problem. In the medical department at Horsens Hospital, in the first three months of the year there were a total of four hours without overcrowding. Four hours. There are simply not enough beds. Under the SR government, there have been many warnings from patients and healthcare personnel, but the SR government turned a deaf ear. Money had to be spent on other things, and that was it. The health area became not prioritized to a sufficient extent. Yes, yes, at the time during the election campaign in 2011 it sounded good enough that one and the other had to be done to improve the healthcare system, but the truth is that the previous government did not lift the area at all. The increased medical expenses were also not dealt with and over a wide range of regions the regions have had to draw up large savings plans. On the whole, the previous government led the way by being financially conscious and in control of the economy. The truth is that it was a beautiful painting , which Bjarne Corydon and the others used a lot of gunpowder to prepare for the election. The economy was driven to the edge, and unpaid bills for questionable priorities were sent on to be settled here after the election. But enough about the previous government and their irresponsibility. Because the election fortunately resulted in a second majority in the Folketing. The regions have already received DKK 1.5 billion more for the health sector, and when we are about to start negotiations on next year's Finance Act, I can assure you that I will take a folder to the negotiations, where it says: <U+0094>The health area!<U+0094> outside. And there will be a LOT of yellow post-it notes in that folder! And I'm trying to be optimistic. Because before the election, there the broad agreement that the health sector must be prioritized. And there are many things to be done within the health system. For example, the imbalance between city and country. Where you are close to one of the new hospitals <U+0096> and there where you are far from and completely dependent on the so-called pre-hospital efforts. It is also a national political responsibility to ensure that the healthcare system is present for everyone <U+0096> regardless of where you live. Although the solutions may be different, safety must be ensured .We must have lifted the healthcare system. It must get better. And that applies to all Danes! All over the country. That is what we want! Do you remember the terrible Saturday in February. The Saturday when a terrorist first attacked a debate meeting at the Krudtt√∏nden on √òsterbro in Copenhagen, then the Jewish synagogue. In both places, an innocent person was killed and officers were injured. A police chase over many hours around large parts of the capital ended with the perpetrator being shot and killed by the police. No one gets me to mourn his death, and we can only guess what prompted him to commit the terrible deeds. But we know that a hatred of the society that had received him drove him, and we must assume, that in his Islamist madness he believed that both debaters who warn against precisely his kind <U+0096> but with words and not weapons <U+0096> and Jews, who are infidel enemies after all, were legitimate targets. I participated in both the two victims' funerals. And I can assure you that I still remember and feel those hours while I'm standing here, Especially the broken relatives. Those who have to live with the grief forever. The terrorist attacks on the French satirical magazine in Paris, Charlie Hebdo, the month before should have turned on all the warning lights, if not for numerous inquiries from the Jewish community in Denmark that clearly felt threats from extremists should have led to action. But nothing happened. It it may not be very useful to talk about it now. But on the other hand, it is important that we learn from it. And we must use that to ensure that everyone in the Folketing is aware of their responsibilities and ensures that the police are well equipped good enough, trained well enough and there are enough of them to ensure safety. And last, but not least, that we support our police officers! think they solve the task that society has set them for properly. But the police officers in the first row, those with bulletproof vests that are too small or large and with automatic weapons in which they have insufficient training, set out in the darkness in search of a murderer who has shot and killed mercilessly not once but twice in a few hours, they deserve the applause of both the politicians and the people! The police also deserved it in the days after the terrorist act. But what has happened since? The previous government started an election campaign and ran an advertising campaign for itself for several months, while frantically trying to knit together something that would look like action in relation to the police. nothing happened to the police's real challenges. The Danish People's Party said in the election campaign that we would work to secure 2,000 more trained officers over the next 10 years. , there are. And the tasks are only getting more and more. And with the chaos we have seen at the borders, it only emphasizes the need. When we have to negotiate a new police agreement later this year, our goal is to create calm and clarity for the police in for a number of years to come. It is crucial that we can live between and with each other in a society like ours, that we can live in security and can trust that the police are there for us when we need help. More officers who were at the border last week have told us about what it's like to be powerless. Not allowed to enforce law and order because you don't have the resources to do so. We must not leave our officers in the lurch. We must secure the police, so the police can assure us! Fortunately, the Danes are somewhat more skeptical of the monster that the EU has become than the majority in the Folketing. .It is quite a cunning plan! They claim that it is a vote for or against Danish participation in the Europol collaboration. But friends <U+0096> if it were that simple, I and the Danish People's Party would gladly recommend a resounding <U+0094>YES!<U+0094>. But it is not. The Union parties use the opportunity with Europol to try to abolish a reservation they have detested for decades. Because that reservation ensures us more Denmark and less EU. They like to see it the other way around. The Minister of Defense came to say shortly after taking office that if the government wins the vote, then we must also have a vote where we can abolish the defense reservation. And both Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen and Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen have also made it clear, that they want Denmark in the euro. The euro?!? What does <U+0092> give you? We must fight for Danish sovereignty. The Denmark that our ancestors created with hard work. The Denmark that creates trust and security. And the Denmark that must be governed by elected representatives in Denmark and not by non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg. In Denmark, we have a tradition of having close knowledge of our politicians and the decisions that are made. We are all responsible for the population and if the politicians do badly, we make the wrong decisions - yes, then the voters can replace us at the next election. You can't do that in the EU. Who, for example, voted for Juncker, Tusk or Mogherini? We politicians must take responsibility to the voters - do not leave our independence to the EU. Once the responsibility is given to the EU, we will never get it back. If we hand over power to the EU, it is irrevocable. If we abolish the reservation of rights, we are tied hand and foot. Then we have to trust the EU and the EU parties in matters of police cooperation, refugees and asylum and all other questions within the legal area. Do we dare? They all want Denmark to as close to the core of the EU as possible. Only the voters stand in the way. Then they can entice the Danes to remove the reservation of rights on December 3, they themselves have the power to decide. Then they will no longer have to do anything related to the legal area, asylum and foreigners etc. ask the Danes. Then we know what happens. I can only remind you that as recently as Monday the government clearly refused to participate in a quota distribution of refugees in the EU. But after arm-twisting they changed in Thursday's opinion and said OK. In 3 days, Chancellor Merkel got her way. After all, the reservations give us some protections that not even Merkel can remove.

56825.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech, Danish People's Party's 20th anniversary meeting, Jyske Bank Boxen, Herning, 19 September 2015. The spoken word applies. You know what we stand for When a three-hour Danish high school class on Bornholm in the d&eacute degree in a small , quickly made film can capture what the Danish People's Party is and is about, then there is justified hope for a good, great and bright future for Denmark! I already saw the film at the Folkem√∏det on Bornholm this summer in the middle of the election campaign. Even then I touched and impressed. Touched because I could feel the Danish People's Party, I could feel all of us and our politics, in the little film. And impressed because the good high school students so quickly and so effectively captured and presented what the Danish People's Party really is .Those students in that high school class,.. They know what we stand for. There hasn't been much to be happy about in recent weeks. Sometimes it's just really boring <U+0096> said in good Jutland < U+0096> to be right. We have long said that the lax and irresponsible handling of border control around Europe, to say the least, would cause disasters. It has! We were unfortunately right. For even longer we have said that the closure of the Danish border control in 2001 was irresponsible and would cause problems. We have also been more right than we care about! And finally, we have long said that aid to the nearby areas from which people otherwise flee should be increased. I reverse that everything back to. But first a very warm welcome to the Danish People's Party's Annual Meeting here in Jyske Bank Boxen! It is a new and somewhat different setting for us. This venue can accommodate 15,000 happy concert participants and has provided settings for concerts with names such as Lady Gaga and Elton John. Here, too, you could hear roars of jubilation from the rafters when both the women's handball and the men's handball have played. And the wildest thing is. The place where you are sitting now was filled with water in December 2013, because the European Championships in Swimming were held. You could ask a bit cheekily why Danmarks Radio could not also use this arena for the international Melodi Grand Prix. It would probably have saved them some money. When we had to deal with whether we could hold the Jubilee Year Meeting here, it was full up with sand and dirt and roaring motorbikes. Super Cross 2015 was to be held. What a place! There are not quite 15,000 of us and we don't have motorbikes in here. Somewhere out by the Skagenshusene, by the caf√© area, there is probably a bit of sand But! We are 1,600 participants here this year! It's not just a record, It's overwhelming. In fact, we are 1,657 including the press today. It's not new that more and more as the years have gone by in our 20-year history have participated in our annual meetings. However, I would like to say, in the usual way of dampening expectations, that next year it will probably not be bigger. After all. I know that some of you have registered just this year, because the anniversary join in the celebration. You are most welcome. And if you think that it should be a habit to come to the annual meeting, then just come again next year! We'll probably find a place! But this year we are 1,600 and I think we should promise each other that we should have a few lovely days with space for lots of political debate but also space to cultivate our community and commemorate 20 years with DF. Almost everyone is also with us tonight for <U+ 0094>the evening of the party<U+0094>. And if the price for so many taking part is that tomorrow we have extra sore legs after the dance <U+0096> and maybe also a little extra sore heads <U+0096> then take for all of you who are attending for the first time, and there are many of you this year, this is guaranteed to be an experience you will not soon forget. This is always the case with the first annual meeting you attend to. And this year extra music, entertainment and fun have been arranged to mark and celebrate the 20 years in which the Danish People's Party has influenced Danish politics. Happy annual meeting to all! All of you here in the Hall know what we stand for. And you know that we will continue to influence Danish politics with our clear positions! This is what we are here for. This is what the Danes rightly expect from us. First of all, Europe must secure and control its external borders! There are those who want to say that you cannot do that.. There are those who want to say that we cannot know. Journalists who report from Hungary's border as if border guards are rascals and bandits and stone-throwing young attackers are freedom heroes. UN<U+0092>'s Ban Ki Moon who accuses Hungary of treating people unacceptable. Is it the stone-throwing youths he is thinking of? Let me just state it: Hungary can be criticized for a lot. But from here they face no criticism that they secure their borders. Every country has the right to defend its borders and decide who you want to open the doors to! The EU<U+0092>'s, and thus Denmark's, challenges basically come from two things: First, almost 15 years ago, national border controls were dropped. In return, they agreed on a strong external border control at Europe's borders. In the Danish People's Party we already knew in 2001 that it was a round of political parade talk. It wouldn't work. And it hasn't either. And now the problems are growing over Europe. The second reason is German and her name is Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel decided two weeks ago to open Germany's borders wide open. But Germany knew very well that part of the challenge was being passed on to other countries <U+0096> including Denmark. For many of those people , who came to Germany, was not registered..Germany therefore bears a heavy responsibility for having signaled with its wobbly course to everyone who wants to come to Europe that now the door is wide open Real refugees in need <U+0096> but unfortunately also people who would very much like to exchange poor living conditions in the Middle East or North Africa for a better life in Scandinavia. It is of course difficult to blame these people for living the dream, but that is not the way forward and we must say no .Denmark must, secondly, reintroduce border controls. And it is urgent! I have heard the other parties almost take turns saying that <U+0094>border controls do not work<U+0094>, so it is not <U+0094>a way to go<U+0094> as they say. But what do they want? When people suddenly come in droves who refuse to be registered and shout that they don't want to be here. And we know that some of them are picked up by immigrant gangs Let me put it this way: it has been ugly to see that foreigners, as long as they are numerous enough and push hard enough at the border, can force a police leadership to its knees and a government to shake its hands. And that has also been unpleasant to hear that <U+0094>everything has happened according to the book<U+0094> and what else the government has now said about the matter. The fact is that what has happened for years since Denmark's Schengen entry in 2001 suddenly became extra visible, because it was about so many people in such a short time. And now they just stopped stopping the trains at the border, so that the flow of people is not a daily media story. Now they are talking about something else < U+0096> but the problem is the same. At the Social Democratic Party, chairman Mette Frederiksen has largely been silent and flown as much as possible under the radar. It seems as if she is thinking: <U+0094> Ha, now L√∏kke has a problem! He has to get out of it himself.<U+0094> Her about it. If it is modern accountability in the Social Democracy in the fall of 2015, then she has to about it. But many proposals for solutions have probably not come from there !It has become so fashionable in politics to say that you want to say <U+0094>clearly<U+0094> something or other. So I want to say clear, so that it can be heard in Aalborg, where the Social Democrats hold Congress these days: Dear Mette Frederiksen. It was you who removed the border control that we agreed four years ago with the then VK government should be reintroduced. It was you who boasted that it was as good as the first , you did, after the general election in 2011. It was you who, with your politics, caused more foreigners to come here on your watch in the past four years, including by significantly higher benefits for those who came here. You have a responsibility .There is a bill to pay. Now is not the time to fly under the radar. The time has come to face your responsibilities! I hope you can see that now, when Germany, of all!<U+0096> and the Netherlands and Poland <U+0096> and more are on the way - have tightened border controls, that it is a clear Danish interest to reintroduce Danish border controls. Even in today's Folketing and on top of a few weeks' experience with extra pressure on the border, the Danish People's Party is still the only party in Christiansborg that insists on border control. And even though we are 37 members of the Folketing against 142 <U+0096> a slightly uneven fight <U+ 0096> then we'll keep going. And you know what? I think time is working for us. And that's why I can also safely promise you and our many voters from June: What we meant before the election <U+0096> also in this area <U+0096> that's what we also mean here after the election: And that means that we won't stop the work of reintroducing border control until it's completed. We WANT control of Denmark's borders! But we also need more than that! In Denmark, we must COMPLETELY reorganize our asylum policy. We must do this completely fundamentally and comprehensively. We must rethink it. It is good that here, after the election, we have tackled parts of the immigration policy. Among other things, we have reduced the benefits that get when you come to Denmark. But we have to move on! That is why last week I called for a national compromise on how we help more real refugees for the money we spend and how we simultaneously ensure the preservation of the Denmark we know .A safe Denmark for all Danes.A Denmark for the foreigners we choose to allow access to, and who can positively contribute to developing Denmark.A Denmark where we continue to have resources for care and help, where we have resources for to develop the core welfare for the sick and the elderly and the vulnerable. Where there is safety! That is why the Danish People's Party is here: To keep Denmark Danish. To secure the welfare society that generations before us have built. To preserve a society, where we basically move in safety and can trust each other. For a number of years there has been an inappropriate mixing of immigration policy and asylum policy. Refugees on temporary residence have been treated as immigrants <U+0096> they have been given three-year integration programmes, Danish courses and legal requirements for housing. All helped along by parties and employer organizations who seem to think that refugees will make a fantastic contribution to the labor market. But that's not how it works in practice! For the numbers we know, it contradicts : A study by the Danish Employers' Association from March shows that, for example, among the Syrians who have immigrated to Denmark in recent years, only about 13 per cent are in work after 4 years in Denmark, while the employment rate of Iraqis and Iranians is actually slightly higher. By comparison, the Danes' employment rate is around 80. And the entire focus has been on integration, not on them going back home when the opportunity is otherwise there. It's not enough! Refugees who come here must not be integrated, they are not to be in years-long integration processes ‚Äì and their legal claim to housing <U+0096>, which means they come to the front of the housing queue ‚Äì must be removed. Refugees who come to Denmark must return home as soon as the conditions in their home countries or nearby areas make it possible .For some it will go quickly, for others it may take years. While they are in Denmark, they must live in asylum centers run by the state. Danes who are in need of help.. If we do the restructuring that we are proposing, we will ensure that refugees know that here in Denmark they can find shelter from persecution, war and destruction. But they cannot get permanent residence, they will not part of Denmark, our country is not a new, permanent destination for them. We do not know if the development means that we will receive more refugees for a period of time. But if our reorganization is carried out, it is probably doubtful. When the conditions improve for human traffickers and all the people who are not really fleeing, but who take advantage of the existing refugee situation to exchange a sad and difficult life in Africa or the Middle East for a better one in Denmark, they probably won't apply here. It doesn't work to be temporary protection, these people are looking for, although that would probably be desirable enough for many refugees. to Scandinavia. Maybe have stayed in one of these countries for several years. Are you a refugee when you finally get to Denmark? No <U+0096> not in my eyes! And while we in this country focus on the arrivals, we are leaving behind millions of genuine refugees who have no money to pay human traffickers, but who are sitting with their families in refugee camps in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Camps where the UN has, for inexplicable reasons, drastically cut aid to food stamps .The people in the camps are going to starve. Those who come up here by train and taxi, the first thing they ask for is power for their iPhones. It was with this paradox in focus that last week I called on the rest of the Danish Parliament to a national compromise, where we agreed across the board on partly a new, strict asylum policy, partly on sending significantly more money to the neighboring areas. In fact, so much that: Denmark will be the world's largest contributor to the neighboring areas! It is part of our Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we help people in need. We Danes have always done that. It has also always been part of the Danish People's Party's policy. That is why we must increase support for the surrounding areas. We would like to see Denmark < U+0096> in relation to its size ‚Äì is one of the biggest contributors in the whole world. D&eacutet wants to emphasize that we mean it seriously. It will show that when we change the conditions for people who come here <U+0096> stop integrating and instead help temporarily <U+0096> yes, in return we will significantly increase support for the surrounding areas. And that will give Denmark and the government weight in the UN and the EU and vis-a-vis oil-rich states not just to propose but to demand, that they also step up the aid! And then it really comes to bat! We help the most by helping those where most still are. In their home countries or in the surrounding areas. Whether we help seven, 10 or 20 more per krone by helping them d&eacuter and not here, is really subordinate. It is a dispute about numbers, which you can argue about for a long time. But that it is many more people we help for every krone we spend, no one doubts .And let's once and for all put an end to the fact that this is a discussion about whether you are good or evil. Whether you are charitable or not. Enhedslisten, SF and the Radicals must fight with each other about who is the most pure for Our Lord and who most quickly and most effectively hurts Denmark socially, politically, culturally and economically by throwing out their arms and inviting everyone up here <U+0096> refugees and migrants among them.<U+0094>Kombardo<U+0094> !While they are fighting about it, I suggest that all other parties solve this in a way that both secures Denmark and the Danes in the future and effectively helps more of the people who are in need. Help in the nearby areas works. Was anyone in doubt, Weekendavisen documented it in an article last Friday. A report from two universities in Great Britain and the USA documents that refugees stay in the areas to a greater extent when sufficient help is available, and that the prosperity of the areas increases - also after peace has been re-established, the camps are closed and the Red Cross has gone home. It must be said to be a win-win-win situation J We must ensure that the society we have been handed down from previous generations and which we value so much on, can be preserved and defended. This can only be done if we both ensure a strong business community that can earn the money home and at the same time are careful about how we use the money. And in relation to the first, let me emphasize that for the Danish People's Party there is no doubt at all that we must ensure good conditions for growth and production. We must ensure that entrepreneurs find it fun to start up in Denmark. That you are not overburdened by administrative requirements, that you can get financing .And we must establish a framework for production in Denmark, which is not miles away from the countries we compete with. rapid conversion to especially wind energy, which has taken place in recent years. This also applies to special professions which are particularly needy and which need quick political attention. For example, it is urgent to implement the 16-point plan for the agricultural sector, which we previously the election agreed with the Liberals, the Liberal Alliance and the conservatives. Otherwise, even more farmers will succumb. We cannot let that happen. We must ensure a better balance between the big cities and the rural areas. Between east and west. Denmark must fit together properly. We is a <U+0096> geographically small country, so it should certainly be possible to create growth and good living conditions everywhere in the country. But this requires targeted political decisions. The Danish People's Party must be known as a party that zealously throws itself into in the fight for the core welfare <U+0096> the conditions, health, security of the elderly. But also as a party that never doubts how values ‚Äã‚Äãare created. Who earns the money. The money that we can talk about afterwards, how we best distribute in our welfare society. And when we talk about distribution, as you know, you can only use the same kroner once. And we have to choose: welfare, safety and trust? Or money wasted on failed and hopeless integration, language courses and expensive housing? We want to ensure a dignified and safe old age for our elderly citizens. There will be more of them in the coming years. They deserve a good life. And we want to ensure that Danes who fall ill can safely count on the fact that there is room at the doctor and in the hospital and that they will receive the best treatment. Therefore, a few words about that. Elderly citizens and their well-being is a political an area which has always had a very central position in the heart of the Danish People's Party. Under the SR government, the elderly area had difficult conditions. In Helle Thorning-Schmidt's first opening speech in the Folketing in autumn 2011, when she had become Prime Minister, the elderly were not mentioned with the only words. In her subsequent New Year's speech, there was a single sentence about the elderly. And then the style was set. It was just not a priority area for the SR government. The municipalities got less money to do good with, despite promises to the contrary. Many municipalities had to therefore cutting down on the elderly, and this has been felt both by the individual elderly, by their relatives and not least by the employees. We must ask ourselves: Is this how we want our care for the elderly to look in the future? Can we really offer our elderly, who have struggled all their lives, such treatment? NO, we can't and shouldn't! We must have the elderly area back on the political agenda. We must create security in elderly care, so that our elderly can look forward to old age with greater joy .We know that safe and well-functioning care for the elderly is one of the most important cornerstones of the Danish welfare society. We MUST restore dignity in care for the elderly. And what does that entail? right to self-determination, self-worth and way of life. This is called a guarantee of dignity, and this has been successfully worked on in our neighboring countries. Here at home, the Elderly has long wanted this on the political agenda. This autumn, we will work to get a guarantee of dignity into Danish care for the elderly. feel safe and have a meaningful life, even though you may be impaired and need daily help. Shouldn't you have the right to get the necessary help for personal hygiene so that you are not sitting in a used nappy? Yes, you do !Shouldn't you ensure the joy of the meal, so that you also increase the appetite of the elderly? Yes, of course!Shouldn't you have help getting out of your home if you want to go for a walk, so that you don't sit isolated inside all day? Yes, you have to! And shouldn't you have the opportunity to be present and talk about what matters to the individual? And respect for privacy and personal boundaries? Yes, that's how we want it in Denmark! But in order to ensure that, of course, resources must be set aside for it. Partly by ensuring that the government's so-called reprioritization contribution does not end up taking money from the municipalities. we reject negative growth in the municipalities, which the reprioritization contribution could otherwise result in. And concretely, the Danish People's Party wants to reintroduce the elderly billion to the country's municipalities this autumn. And it must be a REAL elderly billion, which goes directly to the elderly area and not to fill gaps in other areas in the municipal fund. We would like to call it a billion of dignity. The billion of dignity must ensure more warm hands and more time for the individual elderly. And it must also ensure that there is a special focus on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdementia. A disease that affects more and more people. Yes, there are we have a lot to achieve in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly, and we are very much looking forward to now really getting started on the work! When we talk about our welfare society, that we can feel safe, then it is a cornerstone that we can have trust to our healthcare system. That we know that if the accident is over, we get sick, someone in the family gets sick, then we get the right help. Then we have the best chance of getting well again, and that under dignified and good conditions relationship. But do we feel so safe? Do we feel that the healthcare system is good enough? Many are well helped and are happy with the treatment provided by the many skilled people in our healthcare system. Thank God, there is great satisfaction among many of those who are got through a course of treatment. But we also have challenges. Statistics Denmark recently asked the Danes, and only 6 out of 10 answered that they feel safe being in the healthcare system. We must and can do better. In the first four months of this year, for example, 1,109 patients had to spend the night in hallway areas in Region Zealand's hospitals. So there were 1,109 people who did not have a fixed living room to be in, where they could get a good night's sleep and the rest that is so necessary when you have problems with your health. The chairman of Danish Patients, Lars Engberg, said in this connection. And I quote: <U+0094> It is indecent that nothing is being done. Now it is at least the third year in a row where there is more or less permanent overcrowding .It has almost become the norm for patients to lie in the corridors<U+0094>. Yes! That is completely true. It is obscene! So it is not only obscene that there are not enough beds in the hospitals, it is also dangerous .Because it leads to errors in the treatment and excess mortality among the patients. That is why it is the highest priority for us that we do something about this problem. In the medical department at Horsens Hospital, in the first three months of the year there were a total of four hours without overcrowding. Four hours. There are simply not enough beds. Under the SR government, there have been many warnings from patients and healthcare personnel, but the SR government turned a deaf ear. Money had to be spent on other things, and that was it. The health area became not prioritized to a sufficient extent. Yes, yes, at the time during the election campaign in 2011 it sounded good enough that one and the other had to be done to improve the healthcare system, but the truth is that the previous government did not lift the area at all. The increased medical expenses were also not dealt with and over a wide range of regions the regions have had to draw up large savings plans. On the whole, the previous government led the way by being financially conscious and in control of the economy. The truth is that it was a beautiful painting , which Bjarne Corydon and the others used a lot of gunpowder to prepare for the election. The economy was driven to the edge, and unpaid bills for questionable priorities were sent on to be settled here after the election. But enough about the previous government and their irresponsibility. Because the election fortunately resulted in a second majority in the Folketing. The regions have already received DKK 1.5 billion more for the health sector, and when we are about to start negotiations on next year's Finance Act, I can assure you that I will take a folder to the negotiations, where it says: <U+0094>The health area!<U+0094> outside. And there will be a LOT of yellow post-it notes in that folder! And I'm trying to be optimistic. Because before the election, there the broad agreement that the health sector must be prioritized. And there are many things to be done within the health system. For example, the imbalance between city and country. Where you are close to one of the new hospitals <U+0096> and there where you are far from and completely dependent on the so-called pre-hospital efforts. It is also a national political responsibility to ensure that the healthcare system is present for everyone <U+0096> regardless of where you live. Although the solutions may be different, safety must be ensured .We must have lifted the healthcare system. It must get better. And that applies to all Danes! All over the country. That is what we want! Do you remember the terrible Saturday in February. The Saturday when a terrorist first attacked a debate meeting at the Krudtt√∏nden on √òsterbro in Copenhagen, then the Jewish synagogue. In both places, an innocent person was killed and officers were injured. A police chase over many hours around large parts of the capital ended with the perpetrator being shot and killed by the police. No one gets me to mourn his death, and we can only guess what prompted him to commit the terrible deeds. But we know that a hatred of the society that had received him drove him, and we must assume, that in his Islamist madness he believed that both debaters who warn against precisely his kind <U+0096> but with words and not weapons <U+0096> and Jews, who are infidel enemies after all, were legitimate targets. I participated in both the two victims' funerals. And I can assure you that I still remember and feel those hours while I'm standing here, Especially the broken relatives. Those who have to live with the grief forever. The terrorist attacks on the French satirical magazine in Paris, Charlie Hebdo, the month before should have turned on all the warning lights, if not for numerous inquiries from the Jewish community in Denmark that clearly felt threats from extremists should have led to action. But nothing happened. It it may not be very useful to talk about it now. But on the other hand, it is important that we learn from it. And we must use that to ensure that everyone in the Folketing is aware of their responsibilities and ensures that the police are well equipped good enough, trained well enough and there are enough of them to ensure safety. And last, but not least, that we support our police officers! think they solve the task that society has set them for properly. But the police officers in the first row, those with bulletproof vests that are too small or large and with automatic weapons in which they have insufficient training, set out in the darkness in search of a murderer who has shot and killed mercilessly not once but twice in a few hours, they deserve the applause of both the politicians and the people! The police also deserved it in the days after the terrorist act. But what has happened since? The previous government started an election campaign and ran an advertising campaign for itself for several months, while frantically trying to knit together something that would look like action in relation to the police. nothing happened to the police's real challenges. The Danish People's Party said in the election campaign that we would work to secure 2,000 more trained officers over the next 10 years. , there are. And the tasks are only getting more and more. And with the chaos we have seen at the borders, it only emphasizes the need. When we have to negotiate a new police agreement later this year, our goal is to create calm and clarity for the police in for a number of years to come. It is crucial that we can live between and with each other in a society like ours, that we can live in security and can trust that the police are there for us when we need help. More officers who were at the border last week have told us about what it's like to be powerless. Not allowed to enforce law and order because you don't have the resources to do so. We must not leave our officers in the lurch. We must secure the police, so the police can assure us! Fortunately, the Danes are somewhat more skeptical of the monster that the EU has become than the majority in the Folketing. .It is quite a cunning plan! They claim that it is a vote for or against Danish participation in the Europol collaboration. But friends <U+0096> if it were that simple, I and the Danish People's Party would gladly recommend a resounding <U+0094>YES!<U+0094>. But it is not. The Union parties use the opportunity with Europol to try to abolish a reservation they have detested for decades. Because that reservation ensures us more Denmark and less EU. They like to see it the other way around. The Minister of Defense came to say shortly after taking office that if the government wins the vote, then we must also have a vote where we can abolish the defense reservation. And both Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen and Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen have also made it clear, that they want Denmark in the euro. The euro?!? What does <U+0092> give you? We must fight for Danish sovereignty. The Denmark that our ancestors created with hard work. The Denmark that creates trust and security. And the Denmark that must be governed by elected representatives in Denmark and not by non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg. In Denmark, we have a tradition of having close knowledge of our politicians and the decisions that are made. We are all responsible for the population and if the politicians do badly, we make the wrong decisions - yes, then the voters can replace us at the next election. You can't do that in the EU. Who, for example, voted for Juncker, Tusk or Mogherini? We politicians must take responsibility to the voters - do not leave our independence to the EU. Once the responsibility is given to the EU, we will never get it back. If we hand over power to the EU, it is irrevocable. If we abolish the reservation of rights, we are tied hand and foot. Then we have to trust the EU and the EU parties in matters of police cooperation, refugees and asylum and all other questions within the legal area. Do we dare? They all want Denmark to as close to the core of the EU as possible. Only the voters stand in the way. Then they can entice the Danes to remove the reservation of rights on December 3, they themselves have the power to decide. Then they will no longer have to do anything related to the legal area, asylum and foreigners etc. ask the Danes. Then we know what happens. I can only remind you that as recently as Monday the government clearly refused to participate in a quota distribution of refugees in the EU. But after arm-twisting they changed in Thursday's opinion and said OK. In 3 days, Chancellor Merkel got her way. After all, the reservations give us some protections that not even Merkel can remove.

56825.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech, Danish People's Party's 20th anniversary meeting, Jyske Bank Boxen, Herning, 19 September 2015. The spoken word applies. You know what we stand for When a three-hour Danish high school class on Bornholm in the d&eacute degree in a small , quickly made film can capture what the Danish People's Party is and is about, then there is justified hope for a good, great and bright future for Denmark! I already saw the film at the Folkem√∏det on Bornholm this summer in the middle of the election campaign. Even then I touched and impressed. Touched because I could feel the Danish People's Party, I could feel all of us and our politics, in the little film. And impressed because the good high school students so quickly and so effectively captured and presented what the Danish People's Party really is .Those students in that high school class,.. They know what we stand for. There hasn't been much to be happy about in recent weeks. Sometimes it's just really boring <U+0096> said in good Jutland < U+0096> to be right. We have long said that the lax and irresponsible handling of border control around Europe, to say the least, would cause disasters. It has! We were unfortunately right. For even longer we have said that the closure of the Danish border control in 2001 was irresponsible and would cause problems. We have also been more right than we care about! And finally, we have long said that aid to the nearby areas from which people otherwise flee should be increased. I reverse that everything back to. But first a very warm welcome to the Danish People's Party's Annual Meeting here in Jyske Bank Boxen! It is a new and somewhat different setting for us. This venue can accommodate 15,000 happy concert participants and has provided settings for concerts with names such as Lady Gaga and Elton John. Here, too, you could hear roars of jubilation from the rafters when both the women's handball and the men's handball have played. And the wildest thing is. The place where you are sitting now was filled with water in December 2013, because the European Championships in Swimming were held. You could ask a bit cheekily why Danmarks Radio could not also use this arena for the international Melodi Grand Prix. It would probably have saved them some money. When we had to deal with whether we could hold the Jubilee Year Meeting here, it was full up with sand and dirt and roaring motorbikes. Super Cross 2015 was to be held. What a place! There are not quite 15,000 of us and we don't have motorbikes in here. Somewhere out by the Skagenshusene, by the caf√© area, there is probably a bit of sand But! We are 1,600 participants here this year! It's not just a record, It's overwhelming. In fact, we are 1,657 including the press today. It's not new that more and more as the years have gone by in our 20-year history have participated in our annual meetings. However, I would like to say, in the usual way of dampening expectations, that next year it will probably not be bigger. After all. I know that some of you have registered just this year, because the anniversary join in the celebration. You are most welcome. And if you think that it should be a habit to come to the annual meeting, then just come again next year! We'll probably find a place! But this year we are 1,600 and I think we should promise each other that we should have a few lovely days with space for lots of political debate but also space to cultivate our community and commemorate 20 years with DF. Almost everyone is also with us tonight for <U+ 0094>the evening of the party<U+0094>. And if the price for so many taking part is that tomorrow we have extra sore legs after the dance <U+0096> and maybe also a little extra sore heads <U+0096> then take for all of you who are attending for the first time, and there are many of you this year, this is guaranteed to be an experience you will not soon forget. This is always the case with the first annual meeting you attend to. And this year extra music, entertainment and fun have been arranged to mark and celebrate the 20 years in which the Danish People's Party has influenced Danish politics. Happy annual meeting to all! All of you here in the Hall know what we stand for. And you know that we will continue to influence Danish politics with our clear positions! This is what we are here for. This is what the Danes rightly expect from us. First of all, Europe must secure and control its external borders! There are those who want to say that you cannot do that.. There are those who want to say that we cannot know. Journalists who report from Hungary's border as if border guards are rascals and bandits and stone-throwing young attackers are freedom heroes. UN<U+0092>'s Ban Ki Moon who accuses Hungary of treating people unacceptable. Is it the stone-throwing youths he is thinking of? Let me just state it: Hungary can be criticized for a lot. But from here they face no criticism that they secure their borders. Every country has the right to defend its borders and decide who you want to open the doors to! The EU<U+0092>'s, and thus Denmark's, challenges basically come from two things: First, almost 15 years ago, national border controls were dropped. In return, they agreed on a strong external border control at Europe's borders. In the Danish People's Party we already knew in 2001 that it was a round of political parade talk. It wouldn't work. And it hasn't either. And now the problems are growing over Europe. The second reason is German and her name is Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel decided two weeks ago to open Germany's borders wide open. But Germany knew very well that part of the challenge was being passed on to other countries <U+0096> including Denmark. For many of those people , who came to Germany, was not registered..Germany therefore bears a heavy responsibility for having signaled with its wobbly course to everyone who wants to come to Europe that now the door is wide open Real refugees in need <U+0096> but unfortunately also people who would very much like to exchange poor living conditions in the Middle East or North Africa for a better life in Scandinavia. It is of course difficult to blame these people for living the dream, but that is not the way forward and we must say no .Denmark must, secondly, reintroduce border controls. And it is urgent! I have heard the other parties almost take turns saying that <U+0094>border controls do not work<U+0094>, so it is not <U+0094>a way to go<U+0094> as they say. But what do they want? When people suddenly come in droves who refuse to be registered and shout that they don't want to be here. And we know that some of them are picked up by immigrant gangs Let me put it this way: it has been ugly to see that foreigners, as long as they are numerous enough and push hard enough at the border, can force a police leadership to its knees and a government to shake its hands. And that has also been unpleasant to hear that <U+0094>everything has happened according to the book<U+0094> and what else the government has now said about the matter. The fact is that what has happened for years since Denmark's Schengen entry in 2001 suddenly became extra visible, because it was about so many people in such a short time. And now they just stopped stopping the trains at the border, so that the flow of people is not a daily media story. Now they are talking about something else < U+0096> but the problem is the same. At the Social Democratic Party, chairman Mette Frederiksen has largely been silent and flown as much as possible under the radar. It seems as if she is thinking: <U+0094> Ha, now L√∏kke has a problem! He has to get out of it himself.<U+0094> Her about it. If it is modern accountability in the Social Democracy in the fall of 2015, then she has to about it. But many proposals for solutions have probably not come from there !It has become so fashionable in politics to say that you want to say <U+0094>clearly<U+0094> something or other. So I want to say clear, so that it can be heard in Aalborg, where the Social Democrats hold Congress these days: Dear Mette Frederiksen. It was you who removed the border control that we agreed four years ago with the then VK government should be reintroduced. It was you who boasted that it was as good as the first , you did, after the general election in 2011. It was you who, with your politics, caused more foreigners to come here on your watch in the past four years, including by significantly higher benefits for those who came here. You have a responsibility .There is a bill to pay. Now is not the time to fly under the radar. The time has come to face your responsibilities! I hope you can see that now, when Germany, of all!<U+0096> and the Netherlands and Poland <U+0096> and more are on the way - have tightened border controls, that it is a clear Danish interest to reintroduce Danish border controls. Even in today's Folketing and on top of a few weeks' experience with extra pressure on the border, the Danish People's Party is still the only party in Christiansborg that insists on border control. And even though we are 37 members of the Folketing against 142 <U+0096> a slightly uneven fight <U+ 0096> then we'll keep going. And you know what? I think time is working for us. And that's why I can also safely promise you and our many voters from June: What we meant before the election <U+0096> also in this area <U+0096> that's what we also mean here after the election: And that means that we won't stop the work of reintroducing border control until it's completed. We WANT control of Denmark's borders! But we also need more than that! In Denmark, we must COMPLETELY reorganize our asylum policy. We must do this completely fundamentally and comprehensively. We must rethink it. It is good that here, after the election, we have tackled parts of the immigration policy. Among other things, we have reduced the benefits that get when you come to Denmark. But we have to move on! That is why last week I called for a national compromise on how we help more real refugees for the money we spend and how we simultaneously ensure the preservation of the Denmark we know .A safe Denmark for all Danes.A Denmark for the foreigners we choose to allow access to, and who can positively contribute to developing Denmark.A Denmark where we continue to have resources for care and help, where we have resources for to develop the core welfare for the sick and the elderly and the vulnerable. Where there is safety! That is why the Danish People's Party is here: To keep Denmark Danish. To secure the welfare society that generations before us have built. To preserve a society, where we basically move in safety and can trust each other. For a number of years there has been an inappropriate mixing of immigration policy and asylum policy. Refugees on temporary residence have been treated as immigrants <U+0096> they have been given three-year integration programmes, Danish courses and legal requirements for housing. All helped along by parties and employer organizations who seem to think that refugees will make a fantastic contribution to the labor market. But that's not how it works in practice! For the numbers we know, it contradicts : A study by the Danish Employers' Association from March shows that, for example, among the Syrians who have immigrated to Denmark in recent years, only about 13 per cent are in work after 4 years in Denmark, while the employment rate of Iraqis and Iranians is actually slightly higher. By comparison, the Danes' employment rate is around 80. And the entire focus has been on integration, not on them going back home when the opportunity is otherwise there. It's not enough! Refugees who come here must not be integrated, they are not to be in years-long integration processes ‚Äì and their legal claim to housing <U+0096>, which means they come to the front of the housing queue ‚Äì must be removed. Refugees who come to Denmark must return home as soon as the conditions in their home countries or nearby areas make it possible .For some it will go quickly, for others it may take years. While they are in Denmark, they must live in asylum centers run by the state. Danes who are in need of help.. If we do the restructuring that we are proposing, we will ensure that refugees know that here in Denmark they can find shelter from persecution, war and destruction. But they cannot get permanent residence, they will not part of Denmark, our country is not a new, permanent destination for them. We do not know if the development means that we will receive more refugees for a period of time. But if our reorganization is carried out, it is probably doubtful. When the conditions improve for human traffickers and all the people who are not really fleeing, but who take advantage of the existing refugee situation to exchange a sad and difficult life in Africa or the Middle East for a better one in Denmark, they probably won't apply here. It doesn't work to be temporary protection, these people are looking for, although that would probably be desirable enough for many refugees. to Scandinavia. Maybe have stayed in one of these countries for several years. Are you a refugee when you finally get to Denmark? No <U+0096> not in my eyes! And while we in this country focus on the arrivals, we are leaving behind millions of genuine refugees who have no money to pay human traffickers, but who are sitting with their families in refugee camps in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Camps where the UN has, for inexplicable reasons, drastically cut aid to food stamps .The people in the camps are going to starve. Those who come up here by train and taxi, the first thing they ask for is power for their iPhones. It was with this paradox in focus that last week I called on the rest of the Danish Parliament to a national compromise, where we agreed across the board on partly a new, strict asylum policy, partly on sending significantly more money to the neighboring areas. In fact, so much that: Denmark will be the world's largest contributor to the neighboring areas! It is part of our Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we help people in need. We Danes have always done that. It has also always been part of the Danish People's Party's policy. That is why we must increase support for the surrounding areas. We would like to see Denmark < U+0096> in relation to its size ‚Äì is one of the biggest contributors in the whole world. D&eacutet wants to emphasize that we mean it seriously. It will show that when we change the conditions for people who come here <U+0096> stop integrating and instead help temporarily <U+0096> yes, in return we will significantly increase support for the surrounding areas. And that will give Denmark and the government weight in the UN and the EU and vis-a-vis oil-rich states not just to propose but to demand, that they also step up the aid! And then it really comes to bat! We help the most by helping those where most still are. In their home countries or in the surrounding areas. Whether we help seven, 10 or 20 more per krone by helping them d&eacuter and not here, is really subordinate. It is a dispute about numbers, which you can argue about for a long time. But that it is many more people we help for every krone we spend, no one doubts .And let's once and for all put an end to the fact that this is a discussion about whether you are good or evil. Whether you are charitable or not. Enhedslisten, SF and the Radicals must fight with each other about who is the most pure for Our Lord and who most quickly and most effectively hurts Denmark socially, politically, culturally and economically by throwing out their arms and inviting everyone up here <U+0096> refugees and migrants among them.<U+0094>Kombardo<U+0094> !While they are fighting about it, I suggest that all other parties solve this in a way that both secures Denmark and the Danes in the future and effectively helps more of the people who are in need. Help in the nearby areas works. Was anyone in doubt, Weekendavisen documented it in an article last Friday. A report from two universities in Great Britain and the USA documents that refugees stay in the areas to a greater extent when sufficient help is available, and that the prosperity of the areas increases - also after peace has been re-established, the camps are closed and the Red Cross has gone home. It must be said to be a win-win-win situation J We must ensure that the society we have been handed down from previous generations and which we value so much on, can be preserved and defended. This can only be done if we both ensure a strong business community that can earn the money home and at the same time are careful about how we use the money. And in relation to the first, let me emphasize that for the Danish People's Party there is no doubt at all that we must ensure good conditions for growth and production. We must ensure that entrepreneurs find it fun to start up in Denmark. That you are not overburdened by administrative requirements, that you can get financing .And we must establish a framework for production in Denmark, which is not miles away from the countries we compete with. rapid conversion to especially wind energy, which has taken place in recent years. This also applies to special professions which are particularly needy and which need quick political attention. For example, it is urgent to implement the 16-point plan for the agricultural sector, which we previously the election agreed with the Liberals, the Liberal Alliance and the conservatives. Otherwise, even more farmers will succumb. We cannot let that happen. We must ensure a better balance between the big cities and the rural areas. Between east and west. Denmark must fit together properly. We is a <U+0096> geographically small country, so it should certainly be possible to create growth and good living conditions everywhere in the country. But this requires targeted political decisions. The Danish People's Party must be known as a party that zealously throws itself into in the fight for the core welfare <U+0096> the conditions, health, security of the elderly. But also as a party that never doubts how values ‚Äã‚Äãare created. Who earns the money. The money that we can talk about afterwards, how we best distribute in our welfare society. And when we talk about distribution, as you know, you can only use the same kroner once. And we have to choose: welfare, safety and trust? Or money wasted on failed and hopeless integration, language courses and expensive housing? We want to ensure a dignified and safe old age for our elderly citizens. There will be more of them in the coming years. They deserve a good life. And we want to ensure that Danes who fall ill can safely count on the fact that there is room at the doctor and in the hospital and that they will receive the best treatment. Therefore, a few words about that. Elderly citizens and their well-being is a political an area which has always had a very central position in the heart of the Danish People's Party. Under the SR government, the elderly area had difficult conditions. In Helle Thorning-Schmidt's first opening speech in the Folketing in autumn 2011, when she had become Prime Minister, the elderly were not mentioned with the only words. In her subsequent New Year's speech, there was a single sentence about the elderly. And then the style was set. It was just not a priority area for the SR government. The municipalities got less money to do good with, despite promises to the contrary. Many municipalities had to therefore cutting down on the elderly, and this has been felt both by the individual elderly, by their relatives and not least by the employees. We must ask ourselves: Is this how we want our care for the elderly to look in the future? Can we really offer our elderly, who have struggled all their lives, such treatment? NO, we can't and shouldn't! We must have the elderly area back on the political agenda. We must create security in elderly care, so that our elderly can look forward to old age with greater joy .We know that safe and well-functioning care for the elderly is one of the most important cornerstones of the Danish welfare society. We MUST restore dignity in care for the elderly. And what does that entail? right to self-determination, self-worth and way of life. This is called a guarantee of dignity, and this has been successfully worked on in our neighboring countries. Here at home, the Elderly has long wanted this on the political agenda. This autumn, we will work to get a guarantee of dignity into Danish care for the elderly. feel safe and have a meaningful life, even though you may be impaired and need daily help. Shouldn't you have the right to get the necessary help for personal hygiene so that you are not sitting in a used nappy? Yes, you do !Shouldn't you ensure the joy of the meal, so that you also increase the appetite of the elderly? Yes, of course!Shouldn't you have help getting out of your home if you want to go for a walk, so that you don't sit isolated inside all day? Yes, you have to! And shouldn't you have the opportunity to be present and talk about what matters to the individual? And respect for privacy and personal boundaries? Yes, that's how we want it in Denmark! But in order to ensure that, of course, resources must be set aside for it. Partly by ensuring that the government's so-called reprioritization contribution does not end up taking money from the municipalities. we reject negative growth in the municipalities, which the reprioritization contribution could otherwise result in. And concretely, the Danish People's Party wants to reintroduce the elderly billion to the country's municipalities this autumn. And it must be a REAL elderly billion, which goes directly to the elderly area and not to fill gaps in other areas in the municipal fund. We would like to call it a billion of dignity. The billion of dignity must ensure more warm hands and more time for the individual elderly. And it must also ensure that there is a special focus on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdementia. A disease that affects more and more people. Yes, there are we have a lot to achieve in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly, and we are very much looking forward to now really getting started on the work! When we talk about our welfare society, that we can feel safe, then it is a cornerstone that we can have trust to our healthcare system. That we know that if the accident is over, we get sick, someone in the family gets sick, then we get the right help. Then we have the best chance of getting well again, and that under dignified and good conditions relationship. But do we feel so safe? Do we feel that the healthcare system is good enough? Many are well helped and are happy with the treatment provided by the many skilled people in our healthcare system. Thank God, there is great satisfaction among many of those who are got through a course of treatment. But we also have challenges. Statistics Denmark recently asked the Danes, and only 6 out of 10 answered that they feel safe being in the healthcare system. We must and can do better. In the first four months of this year, for example, 1,109 patients had to spend the night in hallway areas in Region Zealand's hospitals. So there were 1,109 people who did not have a fixed living room to be in, where they could get a good night's sleep and the rest that is so necessary when you have problems with your health. The chairman of Danish Patients, Lars Engberg, said in this connection. And I quote: <U+0094> It is indecent that nothing is being done. Now it is at least the third year in a row where there is more or less permanent overcrowding .It has almost become the norm for patients to lie in the corridors<U+0094>. Yes! That is completely true. It is obscene! So it is not only obscene that there are not enough beds in the hospitals, it is also dangerous .Because it leads to errors in the treatment and excess mortality among the patients. That is why it is the highest priority for us that we do something about this problem. In the medical department at Horsens Hospital, in the first three months of the year there were a total of four hours without overcrowding. Four hours. There are simply not enough beds. Under the SR government, there have been many warnings from patients and healthcare personnel, but the SR government turned a deaf ear. Money had to be spent on other things, and that was it. The health area became not prioritized to a sufficient extent. Yes, yes, at the time during the election campaign in 2011 it sounded good enough that one and the other had to be done to improve the healthcare system, but the truth is that the previous government did not lift the area at all. The increased medical expenses were also not dealt with and over a wide range of regions the regions have had to draw up large savings plans. On the whole, the previous government led the way by being financially conscious and in control of the economy. The truth is that it was a beautiful painting , which Bjarne Corydon and the others used a lot of gunpowder to prepare for the election. The economy was driven to the edge, and unpaid bills for questionable priorities were sent on to be settled here after the election. But enough about the previous government and their irresponsibility. Because the election fortunately resulted in a second majority in the Folketing. The regions have already received DKK 1.5 billion more for the health sector, and when we are about to start negotiations on next year's Finance Act, I can assure you that I will take a folder to the negotiations, where it says: <U+0094>The health area!<U+0094> outside. And there will be a LOT of yellow post-it notes in that folder! And I'm trying to be optimistic. Because before the election, there the broad agreement that the health sector must be prioritized. And there are many things to be done within the health system. For example, the imbalance between city and country. Where you are close to one of the new hospitals <U+0096> and there where you are far from and completely dependent on the so-called pre-hospital efforts. It is also a national political responsibility to ensure that the healthcare system is present for everyone <U+0096> regardless of where you live. Although the solutions may be different, safety must be ensured .We must have lifted the healthcare system. It must get better. And that applies to all Danes! All over the country. That is what we want! Do you remember the terrible Saturday in February. The Saturday when a terrorist first attacked a debate meeting at the Krudtt√∏nden on √òsterbro in Copenhagen, then the Jewish synagogue. In both places, an innocent person was killed and officers were injured. A police chase over many hours around large parts of the capital ended with the perpetrator being shot and killed by the police. No one gets me to mourn his death, and we can only guess what prompted him to commit the terrible deeds. But we know that a hatred of the society that had received him drove him, and we must assume, that in his Islamist madness he believed that both debaters who warn against precisely his kind <U+0096> but with words and not weapons <U+0096> and Jews, who are infidel enemies after all, were legitimate targets. I participated in both the two victims' funerals. And I can assure you that I still remember and feel those hours while I'm standing here, Especially the broken relatives. Those who have to live with the grief forever. The terrorist attacks on the French satirical magazine in Paris, Charlie Hebdo, the month before should have turned on all the warning lights, if not for numerous inquiries from the Jewish community in Denmark that clearly felt threats from extremists should have led to action. But nothing happened. It it may not be very useful to talk about it now. But on the other hand, it is important that we learn from it. And we must use that to ensure that everyone in the Folketing is aware of their responsibilities and ensures that the police are well equipped good enough, trained well enough and there are enough of them to ensure safety. And last, but not least, that we support our police officers! think they solve the task that society has set them for properly. But the police officers in the first row, those with bulletproof vests that are too small or large and with automatic weapons in which they have insufficient training, set out in the darkness in search of a murderer who has shot and killed mercilessly not once but twice in a few hours, they deserve the applause of both the politicians and the people! The police also deserved it in the days after the terrorist act. But what has happened since? The previous government started an election campaign and ran an advertising campaign for itself for several months, while frantically trying to knit together something that would look like action in relation to the police. nothing happened to the police's real challenges. The Danish People's Party said in the election campaign that we would work to secure 2,000 more trained officers over the next 10 years. , there are. And the tasks are only getting more and more. And with the chaos we have seen at the borders, it only emphasizes the need. When we have to negotiate a new police agreement later this year, our goal is to create calm and clarity for the police in for a number of years to come. It is crucial that we can live between and with each other in a society like ours, that we can live in security and can trust that the police are there for us when we need help. More officers who were at the border last week have told us about what it's like to be powerless. Not allowed to enforce law and order because you don't have the resources to do so. We must not leave our officers in the lurch. We must secure the police, so the police can assure us! Fortunately, the Danes are somewhat more skeptical of the monster that the EU has become than the majority in the Folketing. .It is quite a cunning plan! They claim that it is a vote for or against Danish participation in the Europol collaboration. But friends <U+0096> if it were that simple, I and the Danish People's Party would gladly recommend a resounding <U+0094>YES!<U+0094>. But it is not. The Union parties use the opportunity with Europol to try to abolish a reservation they have detested for decades. Because that reservation ensures us more Denmark and less EU. They like to see it the other way around. The Minister of Defense came to say shortly after taking office that if the government wins the vote, then we must also have a vote where we can abolish the defense reservation. And both Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen and Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen have also made it clear, that they want Denmark in the euro. The euro?!? What does <U+0092> give you? We must fight for Danish sovereignty. The Denmark that our ancestors created with hard work. The Denmark that creates trust and security. And the Denmark that must be governed by elected representatives in Denmark and not by non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg. In Denmark, we have a tradition of having close knowledge of our politicians and the decisions that are made. We are all responsible for the population and if the politicians do badly, we make the wrong decisions - yes, then the voters can replace us at the next election. You can't do that in the EU. Who, for example, voted for Juncker, Tusk or Mogherini? We politicians must take responsibility to the voters - do not leave our independence to the EU. Once the responsibility is given to the EU, we will never get it back. If we hand over power to the EU, it is irrevocable. If we abolish the reservation of rights, we are tied hand and foot. Then we have to trust the EU and the EU parties in matters of police cooperation, refugees and asylum and all other questions within the legal area. Do we dare? They all want Denmark to as close to the core of the EU as possible. Only the voters stand in the way. Then they can entice the Danes to remove the reservation of rights on December 3, they themselves have the power to decide. Then they will no longer have to do anything related to the legal area, asylum and foreigners etc. ask the Danes. Then we know what happens. I can only remind you that as recently as Monday the government clearly refused to participate in a quota distribution of refugees in the EU. But after arm-twisting they changed in Thursday's opinion and said OK. In 3 days, Chancellor Merkel got her way. After all, the reservations give us some protections that not even Merkel can remove.

56825.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech, Danish People's Party's 20th anniversary meeting, Jyske Bank Boxen, Herning, 19 September 2015. The spoken word applies. You know what we stand for When a three-hour Danish high school class on Bornholm in the d&eacute degree in a small , quickly made film can capture what the Danish People's Party is and is about, then there is justified hope for a good, great and bright future for Denmark! I already saw the film at the Folkem√∏det on Bornholm this summer in the middle of the election campaign. Even then I touched and impressed. Touched because I could feel the Danish People's Party, I could feel all of us and our politics, in the little film. And impressed because the good high school students so quickly and so effectively captured and presented what the Danish People's Party really is .Those students in that high school class,.. They know what we stand for. There hasn't been much to be happy about in recent weeks. Sometimes it's just really boring <U+0096> said in good Jutland < U+0096> to be right. We have long said that the lax and irresponsible handling of border control around Europe, to say the least, would cause disasters. It has! We were unfortunately right. For even longer we have said that the closure of the Danish border control in 2001 was irresponsible and would cause problems. We have also been more right than we care about! And finally, we have long said that aid to the nearby areas from which people otherwise flee should be increased. I reverse that everything back to. But first a very warm welcome to the Danish People's Party's Annual Meeting here in Jyske Bank Boxen! It is a new and somewhat different setting for us. This venue can accommodate 15,000 happy concert participants and has provided settings for concerts with names such as Lady Gaga and Elton John. Here, too, you could hear roars of jubilation from the rafters when both the women's handball and the men's handball have played. And the wildest thing is. The place where you are sitting now was filled with water in December 2013, because the European Championships in Swimming were held. You could ask a bit cheekily why Danmarks Radio could not also use this arena for the international Melodi Grand Prix. It would probably have saved them some money. When we had to deal with whether we could hold the Jubilee Year Meeting here, it was full up with sand and dirt and roaring motorbikes. Super Cross 2015 was to be held. What a place! There are not quite 15,000 of us and we don't have motorbikes in here. Somewhere out by the Skagenshusene, by the caf√© area, there is probably a bit of sand But! We are 1,600 participants here this year! It's not just a record, It's overwhelming. In fact, we are 1,657 including the press today. It's not new that more and more as the years have gone by in our 20-year history have participated in our annual meetings. However, I would like to say, in the usual way of dampening expectations, that next year it will probably not be bigger. After all. I know that some of you have registered just this year, because the anniversary join in the celebration. You are most welcome. And if you think that it should be a habit to come to the annual meeting, then just come again next year! We'll probably find a place! But this year we are 1,600 and I think we should promise each other that we should have a few lovely days with space for lots of political debate but also space to cultivate our community and commemorate 20 years with DF. Almost everyone is also with us tonight for <U+ 0094>the evening of the party<U+0094>. And if the price for so many taking part is that tomorrow we have extra sore legs after the dance <U+0096> and maybe also a little extra sore heads <U+0096> then take for all of you who are attending for the first time, and there are many of you this year, this is guaranteed to be an experience you will not soon forget. This is always the case with the first annual meeting you attend to. And this year extra music, entertainment and fun have been arranged to mark and celebrate the 20 years in which the Danish People's Party has influenced Danish politics. Happy annual meeting to all! All of you here in the Hall know what we stand for. And you know that we will continue to influence Danish politics with our clear positions! This is what we are here for. This is what the Danes rightly expect from us. First of all, Europe must secure and control its external borders! There are those who want to say that you cannot do that.. There are those who want to say that we cannot know. Journalists who report from Hungary's border as if border guards are rascals and bandits and stone-throwing young attackers are freedom heroes. UN<U+0092>'s Ban Ki Moon who accuses Hungary of treating people unacceptable. Is it the stone-throwing youths he is thinking of? Let me just state it: Hungary can be criticized for a lot. But from here they face no criticism that they secure their borders. Every country has the right to defend its borders and decide who you want to open the doors to! The EU<U+0092>'s, and thus Denmark's, challenges basically come from two things: First, almost 15 years ago, national border controls were dropped. In return, they agreed on a strong external border control at Europe's borders. In the Danish People's Party we already knew in 2001 that it was a round of political parade talk. It wouldn't work. And it hasn't either. And now the problems are growing over Europe. The second reason is German and her name is Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel decided two weeks ago to open Germany's borders wide open. But Germany knew very well that part of the challenge was being passed on to other countries <U+0096> including Denmark. For many of those people , who came to Germany, was not registered..Germany therefore bears a heavy responsibility for having signaled with its wobbly course to everyone who wants to come to Europe that now the door is wide open Real refugees in need <U+0096> but unfortunately also people who would very much like to exchange poor living conditions in the Middle East or North Africa for a better life in Scandinavia. It is of course difficult to blame these people for living the dream, but that is not the way forward and we must say no .Denmark must, secondly, reintroduce border controls. And it is urgent! I have heard the other parties almost take turns saying that <U+0094>border controls do not work<U+0094>, so it is not <U+0094>a way to go<U+0094> as they say. But what do they want? When people suddenly come in droves who refuse to be registered and shout that they don't want to be here. And we know that some of them are picked up by immigrant gangs Let me put it this way: it has been ugly to see that foreigners, as long as they are numerous enough and push hard enough at the border, can force a police leadership to its knees and a government to shake its hands. And that has also been unpleasant to hear that <U+0094>everything has happened according to the book<U+0094> and what else the government has now said about the matter. The fact is that what has happened for years since Denmark's Schengen entry in 2001 suddenly became extra visible, because it was about so many people in such a short time. And now they just stopped stopping the trains at the border, so that the flow of people is not a daily media story. Now they are talking about something else < U+0096> but the problem is the same. At the Social Democratic Party, chairman Mette Frederiksen has largely been silent and flown as much as possible under the radar. It seems as if she is thinking: <U+0094> Ha, now L√∏kke has a problem! He has to get out of it himself.<U+0094> Her about it. If it is modern accountability in the Social Democracy in the fall of 2015, then she has to about it. But many proposals for solutions have probably not come from there !It has become so fashionable in politics to say that you want to say <U+0094>clearly<U+0094> something or other. So I want to say clear, so that it can be heard in Aalborg, where the Social Democrats hold Congress these days: Dear Mette Frederiksen. It was you who removed the border control that we agreed four years ago with the then VK government should be reintroduced. It was you who boasted that it was as good as the first , you did, after the general election in 2011. It was you who, with your politics, caused more foreigners to come here on your watch in the past four years, including by significantly higher benefits for those who came here. You have a responsibility .There is a bill to pay. Now is not the time to fly under the radar. The time has come to face your responsibilities! I hope you can see that now, when Germany, of all!<U+0096> and the Netherlands and Poland <U+0096> and more are on the way - have tightened border controls, that it is a clear Danish interest to reintroduce Danish border controls. Even in today's Folketing and on top of a few weeks' experience with extra pressure on the border, the Danish People's Party is still the only party in Christiansborg that insists on border control. And even though we are 37 members of the Folketing against 142 <U+0096> a slightly uneven fight <U+ 0096> then we'll keep going. And you know what? I think time is working for us. And that's why I can also safely promise you and our many voters from June: What we meant before the election <U+0096> also in this area <U+0096> that's what we also mean here after the election: And that means that we won't stop the work of reintroducing border control until it's completed. We WANT control of Denmark's borders! But we also need more than that! In Denmark, we must COMPLETELY reorganize our asylum policy. We must do this completely fundamentally and comprehensively. We must rethink it. It is good that here, after the election, we have tackled parts of the immigration policy. Among other things, we have reduced the benefits that get when you come to Denmark. But we have to move on! That is why last week I called for a national compromise on how we help more real refugees for the money we spend and how we simultaneously ensure the preservation of the Denmark we know .A safe Denmark for all Danes.A Denmark for the foreigners we choose to allow access to, and who can positively contribute to developing Denmark.A Denmark where we continue to have resources for care and help, where we have resources for to develop the core welfare for the sick and the elderly and the vulnerable. Where there is safety! That is why the Danish People's Party is here: To keep Denmark Danish. To secure the welfare society that generations before us have built. To preserve a society, where we basically move in safety and can trust each other. For a number of years there has been an inappropriate mixing of immigration policy and asylum policy. Refugees on temporary residence have been treated as immigrants <U+0096> they have been given three-year integration programmes, Danish courses and legal requirements for housing. All helped along by parties and employer organizations who seem to think that refugees will make a fantastic contribution to the labor market. But that's not how it works in practice! For the numbers we know, it contradicts : A study by the Danish Employers' Association from March shows that, for example, among the Syrians who have immigrated to Denmark in recent years, only about 13 per cent are in work after 4 years in Denmark, while the employment rate of Iraqis and Iranians is actually slightly higher. By comparison, the Danes' employment rate is around 80. And the entire focus has been on integration, not on them going back home when the opportunity is otherwise there. It's not enough! Refugees who come here must not be integrated, they are not to be in years-long integration processes ‚Äì and their legal claim to housing <U+0096>, which means they come to the front of the housing queue ‚Äì must be removed. Refugees who come to Denmark must return home as soon as the conditions in their home countries or nearby areas make it possible .For some it will go quickly, for others it may take years. While they are in Denmark, they must live in asylum centers run by the state. Danes who are in need of help.. If we do the restructuring that we are proposing, we will ensure that refugees know that here in Denmark they can find shelter from persecution, war and destruction. But they cannot get permanent residence, they will not part of Denmark, our country is not a new, permanent destination for them. We do not know if the development means that we will receive more refugees for a period of time. But if our reorganization is carried out, it is probably doubtful. When the conditions improve for human traffickers and all the people who are not really fleeing, but who take advantage of the existing refugee situation to exchange a sad and difficult life in Africa or the Middle East for a better one in Denmark, they probably won't apply here. It doesn't work to be temporary protection, these people are looking for, although that would probably be desirable enough for many refugees. to Scandinavia. Maybe have stayed in one of these countries for several years. Are you a refugee when you finally get to Denmark? No <U+0096> not in my eyes! And while we in this country focus on the arrivals, we are leaving behind millions of genuine refugees who have no money to pay human traffickers, but who are sitting with their families in refugee camps in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Camps where the UN has, for inexplicable reasons, drastically cut aid to food stamps .The people in the camps are going to starve. Those who come up here by train and taxi, the first thing they ask for is power for their iPhones. It was with this paradox in focus that last week I called on the rest of the Danish Parliament to a national compromise, where we agreed across the board on partly a new, strict asylum policy, partly on sending significantly more money to the neighboring areas. In fact, so much that: Denmark will be the world's largest contributor to the neighboring areas! It is part of our Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we help people in need. We Danes have always done that. It has also always been part of the Danish People's Party's policy. That is why we must increase support for the surrounding areas. We would like to see Denmark < U+0096> in relation to its size ‚Äì is one of the biggest contributors in the whole world. D&eacutet wants to emphasize that we mean it seriously. It will show that when we change the conditions for people who come here <U+0096> stop integrating and instead help temporarily <U+0096> yes, in return we will significantly increase support for the surrounding areas. And that will give Denmark and the government weight in the UN and the EU and vis-a-vis oil-rich states not just to propose but to demand, that they also step up the aid! And then it really comes to bat! We help the most by helping those where most still are. In their home countries or in the surrounding areas. Whether we help seven, 10 or 20 more per krone by helping them d&eacuter and not here, is really subordinate. It is a dispute about numbers, which you can argue about for a long time. But that it is many more people we help for every krone we spend, no one doubts .And let's once and for all put an end to the fact that this is a discussion about whether you are good or evil. Whether you are charitable or not. Enhedslisten, SF and the Radicals must fight with each other about who is the most pure for Our Lord and who most quickly and most effectively hurts Denmark socially, politically, culturally and economically by throwing out their arms and inviting everyone up here <U+0096> refugees and migrants among them.<U+0094>Kombardo<U+0094> !While they are fighting about it, I suggest that all other parties solve this in a way that both secures Denmark and the Danes in the future and effectively helps more of the people who are in need. Help in the nearby areas works. Was anyone in doubt, Weekendavisen documented it in an article last Friday. A report from two universities in Great Britain and the USA documents that refugees stay in the areas to a greater extent when sufficient help is available, and that the prosperity of the areas increases - also after peace has been re-established, the camps are closed and the Red Cross has gone home. It must be said to be a win-win-win situation J We must ensure that the society we have been handed down from previous generations and which we value so much on, can be preserved and defended. This can only be done if we both ensure a strong business community that can earn the money home and at the same time are careful about how we use the money. And in relation to the first, let me emphasize that for the Danish People's Party there is no doubt at all that we must ensure good conditions for growth and production. We must ensure that entrepreneurs find it fun to start up in Denmark. That you are not overburdened by administrative requirements, that you can get financing .And we must establish a framework for production in Denmark, which is not miles away from the countries we compete with. rapid conversion to especially wind energy, which has taken place in recent years. This also applies to special professions which are particularly needy and which need quick political attention. For example, it is urgent to implement the 16-point plan for the agricultural sector, which we previously the election agreed with the Liberals, the Liberal Alliance and the conservatives. Otherwise, even more farmers will succumb. We cannot let that happen. We must ensure a better balance between the big cities and the rural areas. Between east and west. Denmark must fit together properly. We is a <U+0096> geographically small country, so it should certainly be possible to create growth and good living conditions everywhere in the country. But this requires targeted political decisions. The Danish People's Party must be known as a party that zealously throws itself into in the fight for the core welfare <U+0096> the conditions, health, security of the elderly. But also as a party that never doubts how values ‚Äã‚Äãare created. Who earns the money. The money that we can talk about afterwards, how we best distribute in our welfare society. And when we talk about distribution, as you know, you can only use the same kroner once. And we have to choose: welfare, safety and trust? Or money wasted on failed and hopeless integration, language courses and expensive housing? We want to ensure a dignified and safe old age for our elderly citizens. There will be more of them in the coming years. They deserve a good life. And we want to ensure that Danes who fall ill can safely count on the fact that there is room at the doctor and in the hospital and that they will receive the best treatment. Therefore, a few words about that. Elderly citizens and their well-being is a political an area which has always had a very central position in the heart of the Danish People's Party. Under the SR government, the elderly area had difficult conditions. In Helle Thorning-Schmidt's first opening speech in the Folketing in autumn 2011, when she had become Prime Minister, the elderly were not mentioned with the only words. In her subsequent New Year's speech, there was a single sentence about the elderly. And then the style was set. It was just not a priority area for the SR government. The municipalities got less money to do good with, despite promises to the contrary. Many municipalities had to therefore cutting down on the elderly, and this has been felt both by the individual elderly, by their relatives and not least by the employees. We must ask ourselves: Is this how we want our care for the elderly to look in the future? Can we really offer our elderly, who have struggled all their lives, such treatment? NO, we can't and shouldn't! We must have the elderly area back on the political agenda. We must create security in elderly care, so that our elderly can look forward to old age with greater joy .We know that safe and well-functioning care for the elderly is one of the most important cornerstones of the Danish welfare society. We MUST restore dignity in care for the elderly. And what does that entail? right to self-determination, self-worth and way of life. This is called a guarantee of dignity, and this has been successfully worked on in our neighboring countries. Here at home, the Elderly has long wanted this on the political agenda. This autumn, we will work to get a guarantee of dignity into Danish care for the elderly. feel safe and have a meaningful life, even though you may be impaired and need daily help. Shouldn't you have the right to get the necessary help for personal hygiene so that you are not sitting in a used nappy? Yes, you do !Shouldn't you ensure the joy of the meal, so that you also increase the appetite of the elderly? Yes, of course!Shouldn't you have help getting out of your home if you want to go for a walk, so that you don't sit isolated inside all day? Yes, you have to! And shouldn't you have the opportunity to be present and talk about what matters to the individual? And respect for privacy and personal boundaries? Yes, that's how we want it in Denmark! But in order to ensure that, of course, resources must be set aside for it. Partly by ensuring that the government's so-called reprioritization contribution does not end up taking money from the municipalities. we reject negative growth in the municipalities, which the reprioritization contribution could otherwise result in. And concretely, the Danish People's Party wants to reintroduce the elderly billion to the country's municipalities this autumn. And it must be a REAL elderly billion, which goes directly to the elderly area and not to fill gaps in other areas in the municipal fund. We would like to call it a billion of dignity. The billion of dignity must ensure more warm hands and more time for the individual elderly. And it must also ensure that there is a special focus on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdementia. A disease that affects more and more people. Yes, there are we have a lot to achieve in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly, and we are very much looking forward to now really getting started on the work! When we talk about our welfare society, that we can feel safe, then it is a cornerstone that we can have trust to our healthcare system. That we know that if the accident is over, we get sick, someone in the family gets sick, then we get the right help. Then we have the best chance of getting well again, and that under dignified and good conditions relationship. But do we feel so safe? Do we feel that the healthcare system is good enough? Many are well helped and are happy with the treatment provided by the many skilled people in our healthcare system. Thank God, there is great satisfaction among many of those who are got through a course of treatment. But we also have challenges. Statistics Denmark recently asked the Danes, and only 6 out of 10 answered that they feel safe being in the healthcare system. We must and can do better. In the first four months of this year, for example, 1,109 patients had to spend the night in hallway areas in Region Zealand's hospitals. So there were 1,109 people who did not have a fixed living room to be in, where they could get a good night's sleep and the rest that is so necessary when you have problems with your health. The chairman of Danish Patients, Lars Engberg, said in this connection. And I quote: <U+0094> It is indecent that nothing is being done. Now it is at least the third year in a row where there is more or less permanent overcrowding .It has almost become the norm for patients to lie in the corridors<U+0094>. Yes! That is completely true. It is obscene! So it is not only obscene that there are not enough beds in the hospitals, it is also dangerous .Because it leads to errors in the treatment and excess mortality among the patients. That is why it is the highest priority for us that we do something about this problem. In the medical department at Horsens Hospital, in the first three months of the year there were a total of four hours without overcrowding. Four hours. There are simply not enough beds. Under the SR government, there have been many warnings from patients and healthcare personnel, but the SR government turned a deaf ear. Money had to be spent on other things, and that was it. The health area became not prioritized to a sufficient extent. Yes, yes, at the time during the election campaign in 2011 it sounded good enough that one and the other had to be done to improve the healthcare system, but the truth is that the previous government did not lift the area at all. The increased medical expenses were also not dealt with and over a wide range of regions the regions have had to draw up large savings plans. On the whole, the previous government led the way by being financially conscious and in control of the economy. The truth is that it was a beautiful painting , which Bjarne Corydon and the others used a lot of gunpowder to prepare for the election. The economy was driven to the edge, and unpaid bills for questionable priorities were sent on to be settled here after the election. But enough about the previous government and their irresponsibility. Because the election fortunately resulted in a second majority in the Folketing. The regions have already received DKK 1.5 billion more for the health sector, and when we are about to start negotiations on next year's Finance Act, I can assure you that I will take a folder to the negotiations, where it says: <U+0094>The health area!<U+0094> outside. And there will be a LOT of yellow post-it notes in that folder! And I'm trying to be optimistic. Because before the election, there the broad agreement that the health sector must be prioritized. And there are many things to be done within the health system. For example, the imbalance between city and country. Where you are close to one of the new hospitals <U+0096> and there where you are far from and completely dependent on the so-called pre-hospital efforts. It is also a national political responsibility to ensure that the healthcare system is present for everyone <U+0096> regardless of where you live. Although the solutions may be different, safety must be ensured .We must have lifted the healthcare system. It must get better. And that applies to all Danes! All over the country. That is what we want! Do you remember the terrible Saturday in February. The Saturday when a terrorist first attacked a debate meeting at the Krudtt√∏nden on √òsterbro in Copenhagen, then the Jewish synagogue. In both places, an innocent person was killed and officers were injured. A police chase over many hours around large parts of the capital ended with the perpetrator being shot and killed by the police. No one gets me to mourn his death, and we can only guess what prompted him to commit the terrible deeds. But we know that a hatred of the society that had received him drove him, and we must assume, that in his Islamist madness he believed that both debaters who warn against precisely his kind <U+0096> but with words and not weapons <U+0096> and Jews, who are infidel enemies after all, were legitimate targets. I participated in both the two victims' funerals. And I can assure you that I still remember and feel those hours while I'm standing here, Especially the broken relatives. Those who have to live with the grief forever. The terrorist attacks on the French satirical magazine in Paris, Charlie Hebdo, the month before should have turned on all the warning lights, if not for numerous inquiries from the Jewish community in Denmark that clearly felt threats from extremists should have led to action. But nothing happened. It it may not be very useful to talk about it now. But on the other hand, it is important that we learn from it. And we must use that to ensure that everyone in the Folketing is aware of their responsibilities and ensures that the police are well equipped good enough, trained well enough and there are enough of them to ensure safety. And last, but not least, that we support our police officers! think they solve the task that society has set them for properly. But the police officers in the first row, those with bulletproof vests that are too small or large and with automatic weapons in which they have insufficient training, set out in the darkness in search of a murderer who has shot and killed mercilessly not once but twice in a few hours, they deserve the applause of both the politicians and the people! The police also deserved it in the days after the terrorist act. But what has happened since? The previous government started an election campaign and ran an advertising campaign for itself for several months, while frantically trying to knit together something that would look like action in relation to the police. nothing happened to the police's real challenges. The Danish People's Party said in the election campaign that we would work to secure 2,000 more trained officers over the next 10 years. , there are. And the tasks are only getting more and more. And with the chaos we have seen at the borders, it only emphasizes the need. When we have to negotiate a new police agreement later this year, our goal is to create calm and clarity for the police in for a number of years to come. It is crucial that we can live between and with each other in a society like ours, that we can live in security and can trust that the police are there for us when we need help. More officers who were at the border last week have told us about what it's like to be powerless. Not allowed to enforce law and order because you don't have the resources to do so. We must not leave our officers in the lurch. We must secure the police, so the police can assure us! Fortunately, the Danes are somewhat more skeptical of the monster that the EU has become than the majority in the Folketing. .It is quite a cunning plan! They claim that it is a vote for or against Danish participation in the Europol collaboration. But friends <U+0096> if it were that simple, I and the Danish People's Party would gladly recommend a resounding <U+0094>YES!<U+0094>. But it is not. The Union parties use the opportunity with Europol to try to abolish a reservation they have detested for decades. Because that reservation ensures us more Denmark and less EU. They like to see it the other way around. The Minister of Defense came to say shortly after taking office that if the government wins the vote, then we must also have a vote where we can abolish the defense reservation. And both Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen and Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen have also made it clear, that they want Denmark in the euro. The euro?!? What does <U+0092> give you? We must fight for Danish sovereignty. The Denmark that our ancestors created with hard work. The Denmark that creates trust and security. And the Denmark that must be governed by elected representatives in Denmark and not by non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg. In Denmark, we have a tradition of having close knowledge of our politicians and the decisions that are made. We are all responsible for the population and if the politicians do badly, we make the wrong decisions - yes, then the voters can replace us at the next election. You can't do that in the EU. Who, for example, voted for Juncker, Tusk or Mogherini? We politicians must take responsibility to the voters - do not leave our independence to the EU. Once the responsibility is given to the EU, we will never get it back. If we hand over power to the EU, it is irrevocable. If we abolish the reservation of rights, we are tied hand and foot. Then we have to trust the EU and the EU parties in matters of police cooperation, refugees and asylum and all other questions within the legal area. Do we dare? They all want Denmark to as close to the core of the EU as possible. Only the voters stand in the way. Then they can entice the Danes to remove the reservation of rights on December 3, they themselves have the power to decide. Then they will no longer have to do anything related to the legal area, asylum and foreigners etc. ask the Danes. Then we know what happens. I can only remind you that as recently as Monday the government clearly refused to participate in a quota distribution of refugees in the EU. But after arm-twisting they changed in Thursday's opinion and said OK. In 3 days, Chancellor Merkel got her way. After all, the reservations give us some protections that not even Merkel can remove.

53842.0," In short, it is high time that more basic sense entered several of the Danish Parliament's initiatives. An example: At the weekend we saw Kolding Municipality's mayor, J√∏rn Pedersen (V), in the media. He strongly urged that refugees' legal claims to permanent housing be removed. The background is that the municipality has bought and newly renovated some properties. The rooms are large and the kitchen/bath/toilet conditions are extremely good. But the refugees refuse to live there. It's too far away. A village 13 kilometers from Kolding We have also experienced something similar on Bornholm. Refugees would not be placed in one of Denmark's most sought-after resorts. Absolutely incredible and incomprehensible to experience this fastidiousness and pampering among a group that one must assume is on the run for their lives. They get ahead of Danes in the housing queue, and then what they are offered is not good enough. So you imagine people whose home in Syria has been blown away by bombs, who do not find a newly renovated house in one of Denmark's quiet natural areas attractive ... Hmmmm... How naive are we Danes allowed to be? Let's remove these migrants' legal claims to permanent housing immediately. Exactly as the mayor urges us to do. Why should these housing picky visitors have a legal claim to get ahead of Danes in the housing queue? Stop it now! The Danish People's Party is making that proposal again in the Folketing. I hope that this time the other parties will support our proposal. Another example: A large number of the parties in the Folketing agree with us that foreign preachers of hate, who should probably rightly be called preachers of violence, should not have access to Denmark. This should really go without saying, but only after TV2's documentary Mosques behind the veil"", things seem to have progressed so that it can actually be implemented. There is just the ""but"" that it obviously requires border control. Because you can't keep someone out of Denmark unless you have the right to check that they are on their way to enter the country. And as several experts state today, the current Schengen cooperation prevents just that. The simple answer is therefore that we must be ready to do away with Schengen in its current form! In any case, the other parties must not be allowed to say: <U+0094>Well, we would otherwise like to keep preachers of violence out, but unfortunately we cannot do that for Schengen<U+0094>. Now they have made it clear that they are determined to stop these preachers of hate and violence from entering Denmark - then they must also take the consequences in relation to ensuring again that we (even after the so-called temporary border control) can control our borders. Gold's ideology and support for the EU should not mean that we fail to do what is obviously right if we are to end radicalization in Denmark. Several parties in Christiansborg must become better at dropping automatic thinking and daring to think new. Because sometimes it seems that the EU, conventions and everything else is used as an excuse, indeed almost a welcome straitjacket, to refrain from doing the right things for ideological reasons. I say: More sense from the Folketinget &#8722 away with legal demands on housing and stop violent preachers! It is urgent.

57066.0," Does anyone remember the year-long election campaign? Does anyone remember all the great declarations of intent about a <U+0094>confrontation with bloc politics?<U+0094> Helle Thorning-Schmidt spoke of a new beginning and cooperation across the middle. Now we had to do away with the bourgeois government's bloc policy with the Danish People's Party. The myth of the bourgeois government's bloc policy was an effective tool in the election campaign <U+0096> because most Danes have a sincere desire for politicians to cooperate widely in the Folketing. But now we've got red block politics, so it clashes <U+0096> with Enhedslisten in the role of the government's parliamentary basis. We have already had a taste of this with the advertising tax of DKK 400 million, which complicates the conditions for the business world and will cost Danish jobs. The compensation <U+0096> DKK 280 annually in <U+0094>supplementary green check<U+0094> to the weakest Danes for the increased taxes <U+0096> is downright ridiculous when the average Dane will pay approx. DKK 4,000 in increased taxes. At the same time, the taxes affect society disproportionately. The smokers are punished disproportionately harshly, and on that background it seems like a direct mockery when representatives from the red government talk about the preventive aspect. <U+0094>The kickstart<U+0094> of the Danish economy primarily benefits the Border Shop and Otto Duborg's border trade in Germany. Here they have reason to be happy about the prospect of a resurgence of cross-border trade. Now it is not only worthwhile to buy beer and wine, but also cigarettes, soft drinks, sweets and a large number of other goods, which the red government has charged with increased taxes <U+0096> and it is again worthwhile to drive long distances . In other words, the government's Stalinist system of taxes also has consequences for the environment, when, for example, tax-plagued North Jutland residents also start driving towards the Danish-German border in search of cheap goods. In addition, as announced, the red government has removed the so-called poverty benefits, the cash assistance ceiling and the start-up aid. May I remind you that the previous government and the Danish People's Party did not introduce these benefits to torment the recipients of cash assistance. We introduced them to provide an increased incentive to look for work <U+0096> and for foreigners, because we did not want to make Denmark a draw for economic refugees. With the removal of these benefits, the government has opened a Pandora's box. No one can calculate what the abolition of start-up aid will cost in the form of increased immigration to Denmark. A blank check has thus effectively been issued. Helle Thorning-Schmidt has a formidable ability to ignore reality. Something like this has never been seen before, and several people have also pointed out that the resemblance to the former Iraqi pro-Daminist, <U+0094>Komiske Ali<U+0094>, is striking. But while Komiske Ali was quickly put out of action by the advancing American forces, Helle Thorning-Schmidt continues endlessly. The question of Ole Sohn's doings and actions as former chairman of DKP is simply ignored, and everyone sits back with their eyes wide open and asks themselves how it can even be done. The prime minister has simply set new standards in the discipline of clever spin and explanations, and apparently the media is jumping on the bandwagon. Immediately after the election, Helle Thorning-Schmidt stated that she would be prime minister for <U+0094>all of Denmark<U+0094>. That has proven to be untrue <U+0096> both politically and geographically. The election was decided by approx. 8000 votes. In other words, the score was almost tied between the two blocs. Is Helle Thorning-Schmidt prime minister for all parties' voters? And is Helle Thorning-Schmidt prime minister for the voters in the South Funen area, where the emergency function in Svendborg - directly against the Social Democratic Party's election promises <U+0096> will be closed down? Or is she prime minister for the voters in the fringe areas where the demolition pool is being removed, so that it will now be even more difficult to attract new residents? No, Helle Thorning-Schmidt is first and foremost prime minister because she wants to be prime minister. And Villy S√∏vndal is foreign minister because he wants to be foreign minister. <U+0094>The role-playing government<U+0094> plays government because it's fun to have power and play ministers. Then come the voters in the second row <U+0096>, not least the voters who crossed the Social Democratic Party or the Socialist People's Party out of a deep-felt desire for change.

57170.0," I can't say I was in any way surprised. Still, I was deeply depressed when I read the latest survey from Ugebrevet A4, in which a number of artists were asked if they believe that their freedom of expression has become less free since the Mohammed crisis more than four years ago. I think it is sad to see that half of the respondents feel that their freedom of expression has been threatened. Every 8th of these artists have experienced one or more times that there are projects or tasks they have refused, for fear of reprisals from Islamic extremists. Where are we right now? The constitution protects us against censorship. You cannot legislate against self-censorship. We impose self-censorship on ourselves. For financial reasons. Out of mock consideration. Out of fear. To that extent, I can understand the artists' fear. We saw with Kurt Westergaard the other day how far the extremists are willing to go. As a politician, I also know all too well the feeling that there are things that it would probably have been easier to keep quiet about if you want to avoid problems. However, I reserve the right to speak my mind, and must indeed also accept what it entails. Politicians who are always silent and agree, or who follow others' mouths, have no reason to be politicians. I wish the Danish artists would also speak their mind, express their thoughts on paper and canvas, and thereby preserve and maintain the freedom of expression that we Danes are rightly proud of and which is a Danish core value. If we remain silent for the sake of Islamist thugs, then freedom of speech withers and dies. Because if you don't dare to speak your mind out of sheer fear of the consequences, then surely freedom has already been lost? We talked about it in the Danish People's Party parliamentary group, a few weeks after the Mohammed crisis had begun. We saw the burning Dannebrog, the riots, and the ugly images of enraged Muslims who wished death and destruction upon Denmark and the Danes. In the parliamentary group, we agreed that the highest price we could risk paying for the Mohammed crisis would be if the furious hordes of Muslims would put a damper on Danish caricaturists and other Danish artists, so that in the future they would no longer dare exercise their constitutional right to express themselves freely and freely. As far as I can see, our worst fears in the parliamentary group have been confirmed by the investigation from A4. The artists have lost their nerve and no longer dare to speak their mind as soon as they risk offending a Muslim. That's what we feared. In fact, we have also come this far, so I have to praise Ugebrevet A4 for even daring to do this investigation, and to focus on such a hysterically sensitive subject as the fear of Muslim reprisals. Thanks to A4 for daring. This is the way we must go. In the Danish media, one also sees a tendency towards a less free ability to express one's opinion <U+0096> Reluctance or lack of courage? - just as soon, it's about Muslims. While several major Norwegian dailies reprinted the Muhammad cartoons in sympathy with Kurt Westergaard after the gross assault, and encouraged their Danish sister newspapers to follow suit, the Danish dailies have shone with their lack of sympathy. They do not dare. Jyllands Posten's editor-in-chief, J√∏rn Mikkelsen, explains that the threats against the newspaper have now become so serious that one does not dare to take the risk. The newspaper has even had the drawings removed from the website, where they have otherwise been found since they were printed in Jyllands Posten for the first time. Jyllands-Posten has bowed down to those who want to suppress freedom of expression. Ekstra Bladet has clearly also changed their otherwise sharp and polished attitude, which they built up during the Mohammed crisis. No one should cow or threaten Denmark's leading media watchdog, who dares and never ever remains silent. Today the dog has become a bit of a toothless carpet pee. The newspaper now believes that the price may be too high and that better cases must be found to fight for. Better matters than freedom of speech?? Can a newspaper seriously think that?? When I suggested a few weeks ago that children of unintegrated immigrants should be forced into nursery school, in order to build a social Danish network and create a daily life among other Danish children before they start primary school, I was met by the usual barrage about how racist and disgusting I am. Disgusting? Racist? The proposal was meant to help the small New Danes and Denmark. If I had suggested that Danish children, who for one reason or another grow up as isolated individuals, should be forced into kindergarten in the same way to ensure that the little ones get a good social start to their education, then there wouldn't have been a cat , which would have raised an eyebrow. But children of Muslims, you can't force them into nursery school. Imagine if they got mad. My advice to everyone, and this applies not only to the artists and journalists, but to all of us Danes, is that we stand together to defend our freedom of expression. Of course, we must speak nicely to and about each other, but the truth, the truth we ourselves think we know, we must not be afraid to put into practice. We must dare and we must have the courage to support those who dare and do it.

54573.0," Pia Kj√¶rsgaard's weekly newsletter - Monday 6 December 2010 Swinging on the left <U+0094 >We will never ever, never, never, never, never ever enter into a government with the Danish People's Party<U+0094>. Do these words seem a bit strained, desperate and convulsive? Quite right: Villy S√∏vndal is a man under pressure. On the one hand, voters must be convinced that immigration policy is in the best hands. On the other hand, the hinterland must be assured that the Danish People's Party will be fought tooth and nail. Yes, it is not easy to be Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal in this day and age. The chairman of the Social Democrats also had to come out with a message that <U+0094>enough is enough<U+0094>. The immigration policy is strict enough. But now it's Villy S√∏vndal's turn, who has to convince the core troops <U+0096> those he calls the cynics <U+0096> that even if the Socialist People's Party pretends that the immigration policy must remain strict and, in addition, tilts a little with Dannebrog , then it doesn't matter. It's just strategy, mates. But the comrades get stuck and refuse to understand the strategy. The former left-wing socialist Preben Wilhjelm suggested in a column in Politiken a few days ago that S and SF should form a government with the Danish People's Party. Of course with a twinkle in the eye and with a sarcastic disclosure of the real possibilities for a possible S-SF government. Wilhjelm is absolutely right that cooperation with the radicals and Enhedslisten will be very difficult if the promises of a <U+0094>strict<U+0094> immigration policy are to be fulfilled. The former VS must be a terribly annoying stone in Villy S√∏vndal's shoes. Here is the voice of the socialist hinterland. A voice that mocks the Socialist People's Party's fierce pursuit of government power, and which at regular intervals forces the SF chairman to pull the emergency brake and long for the Danish People's Party. But no match without winners. In this case, the winner is the radical leader Margrethe Vestager, who quite understandably cannot get over S√∏vndal's latest promise that a future S-SF government <U+0094>never<U+0094> will cooperate with the Danish People's Party on immigration policy. The maneuver is difficult. On the one hand, Villy S√∏vndal is well aware that voters want a continuation of the current strict immigration policy. Therefore, the Socialist People's Party <U+0096>, after rejecting the government's and the Danish People's Party's points system <U+0096>, had to hastily put together a partially copied alternative. A kind of <U+0094>point system-light<U+0094>, which the radicals and Enhedslisten will never vote for. On the other hand, he has to distance himself from the Danish People's Party. The latest example of this deeply ridiculous spin doctor-directed double game is the Socialist People's Party's fight for Dannebrog and Danishness. Now the Danish wage earners suddenly have to be pampered. Among other things, they must be protected against eastern workers and guaranteed the right to strike. Against this background, it is strange that Margrete Auken together with Poul Nyrup Rasmussen earlier in the EU Parliament voted no to an amendment which guaranteed the right to strike. But who notices this, one thinks. The Socialist People's Party must be more than welcome in the fight for Danish values. I would very much like to fight that battle together with other parties. Especially because I know that neither Enhedslisten nor the radicals will join the fight. But I have to admit that I find it a bit difficult to see the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democracy as real partners in the fight, when the parties simultaneously want a head-on showdown with the EU reservations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlaw and defence. It doesn't really rhyme with fighting for Danish interests. Nevertheless, I will maintain the Socialist People's Party in this fight. Why does the Danish People's Party have to fight all alone? But I expect the fight to consist of more than a nice ad with EU parliamentarian Emilie Turunen wearing a work helmet with Dannebrog and <U+0094>Lune Villy<U+0094> in the background. The fight must include initiatives that maintain Denmark as a coherent society, and I have a little difficulty imagining that if Margrethe Vestager has to turn the thumbs up. It is no wonder that there is a party atmosphere in the radical camp. Not only has the party experienced an influx of dissatisfied SF voters <U+0096> but with the categorical rejection of any cooperation with the Danish People's Party, Villy S√∏vndal has at the same time thrown himself into the arms of Margrethe Vestager. And here he must be aware of one thing: Radical embraces are expensive. The price is concessions in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãforeigners. If the radicals get it the way they want it, it means goodbye to the 24-year rule, goodbye to affiliation requirements, goodbye to the points system, goodbye to start-up aid. In short, goodbye to the austerity of the last nine years. But Helle Thorning-Schmidt is also busy making Margrethe Vestager comfortable. At our latest duel meeting in S√∏nderborg, she even went so far as to say that the Social Democrats have much more in common with the radicals than with the Danish People's Party. When I asked what it was, I didn't really get an answer. I would like to know, for example, whether this applies to the settlement of the pension and abolition of the top tax <U+0096> or perhaps an abolition of the 24-year rule? All in all, there is reason to wish the radicals' leader Margrethe Vestager and Enhedslisten congratulations. It seems that the Social Democrats' and Socialist People's Party's <U+0094>strict<U+0094> immigration policy sends disgruntled customers without the necessary sense of spin doctor-led election campaign strategies over to the two extreme parties. And in addition, both Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal have declared their unreserved love for the radical leader. I now anticipate with excitement how the Socialist People's Party will fight for Danishness, while at the same time taking into account the hinterland and fattening Margrethe Vestager under the chin. It can't be anything other than entertaining.

54183.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's annual meeting speech 2020. Odense, 28 November Dear everyone. A warm welcome to the Danish People's Party's annual meeting. Both of you who are gathered in Aalborg, you who are in Silkeborg, you who are in Ringsted, you who are in Copenhagen and you, sitting here in the Odeon in Odense. We are spread over 5 locations in Denmark, but nevertheless gathered for the annual meeting. I have been looking forward to that - thank you for joining us. We are here because we are fighting for Denmark. We have done it the last 25 years and prepare ourselves to do so for the next 25 years as well. We are fighting for Denmark. The Denmark that we grew up in. That we inherited from our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents. The country we heard about when we sat on your lap as children and were read aloud. The land that is impossible to put into words. That we just carry in our hearts. The bright nights. The autumn breeze. The many colors of the forest. The walks by the North Sea. The cornfield just before the harvest. The children , who play on the road in the detached house quarter. The family gathered for baptism and confirmation. Beer over the hedge. Strawberries and meatballs. But also freedom and community. Safety and trust. common history, common culture, common traditions - common values. Where we are rounded from the same soil. Rooted in the Christian cultural heritage."" In Denmark I was born, there is my home. There I have ROOT, from there my world goes. "" A country where ""few have too much and fewer have too little"", as Grundtvig writes. Where we care about each other. Where the community helps those who need a loving hand. Where the children thrive. Go to school happily and meet an education system , that makes you smarter. Prepares for the world you meet as an adult. Ensures that all children ‚Äì regardless of background ‚Äì get the chance. Where we are safe in sending our children off. Safe in letting them roam the streets and alleys ‚Äì also in nightlife, when they are a little older. Where the police come when we need it. Where you don't have to be nervous about whether there is work to be found. Where we appreciate that there are compatriots who set up businesses. there are entrepreneurs - innovative people - people who develop and produce. Where there is balance in our country. So it is just as easy to live and work, get educated and run a business in the west as in the east. In the north as in the south. Where we have a world-class healthcare system. Close to the citizens. Where you don't have to fear getting old. Because the help and care is there when we can no longer manage on our own. This is the Denmark we want. The Denmark we must fight for for. The Denmark that we would like to pass on to our children and grandchildren. A Denmark that we can also recognize in 25 years. 50 years. 100 years. The home of the Danes. This small spot on the earth that generation after generation has shaped before us. And which must not be run over by people from other parts of the world. Where our values ‚Äã‚Äãapply. EVERYWHERE in the country. Where we have not let immigrants change our country beyond recognition. There was a time when politicians from the other parties left the parliament hall , because they didn't want to listen to us. The Danes, on the other hand, would like that - and perhaps that's why many of the other parties too. We shouldn't be sad about that. We should be proud of that. But if we hadn't fought the battle, then they others failed, Denmark would have been in a much worse place than we are. Then Denmark and Sweden would have looked alike. Good enough, we have big problems with immigrants - parallel societies - crime. But it's still nothing compared to the problems they face in Sweden. So if it weren't for the corona, you should give each other a pat on the back. Both for everything you've helped to secure for our country , but also to get ready for the next matches. Because we are not done with the work yet. Here are 8 important goals for us. Which should make our dreams of our Denmark come a little closer to reality! We must appreciate the good old nuclear family with mother, father and children. It must be safe and secure to be young and grow up in Denmark. We must have a legal society, with a visible police and punishments that deter. One must be able to educate and work, create a good life in ALL of Denmark. Where you can safely grow old. Where we secure our values. Our culture that is based on the Christian heritage. An independent country where the Danes decide. Not bureaucrats in Brussels. Where we take care of the environment as a matter of course and the climate. Let me take them one at a time: First goal. We must value the good old nuclear family with mother, father and children. Of course, people can live in many different ways. We must fully respect that. this is about. But therefore we can recognize that what most people strive for ‚Äì is a family with mother, father and children. That this family context forms a fundamental building block in our society. The family, which is the framework for most of our existence. Where you are safe. Can be yourself. Where the children grow up and can reflect in the parent and grandparent generation. It is not always that the dream lasts. That the families split up. There are far too many families that must capitulate. We cannot make ends meet. That is why we must also do what we can to create the best framework for the family. We must give families more freedom to decide for themselves how they want to arrange their lives. So there is time and space to just be a family. It simply has to be easier for the new families with children to get their everyday life together. We can do that by ensuring a freer choice in relation to whether sometimes want to look after the little ones themselves. Instead of the institution always being the only possible choice. We want to make it a real possibility that you can look after the little ones yourself. But today it is mainly only an option if the one parent has a very well-paid job. By offering a subsidy at the daily allowance level to the one parent who looks after the little ones at home, we want to ensure that it is a real opportunity for everyone. The best framework for families with children also means that it is the parents, who must decide how the maternity period should be distributed between father and mother. Neither Christiansborg nor the EU should interfere in that. 2. Secondly. It must be safe and secure to grow up in Denmark. Unfortunately, this is not the case everywhere .A new disgusting phenomenon has appeared in our country. It is called dominance violence. Where people - often young people - are assaulted. But where the violence in itself is not enough for the perpetrators. Where the victims must be humiliated. are not only exposed to the physical harm, but also subsequently have to live with being exhibited on social media. So it is completely wrong. We must not put up with it. A sick culture. Boys who are spat in the face and forced to to kiss a perpetrator's shoes. The assaults often have a racist undertone. Where it is immigrant boys who perpetrate the domination violence against Danish boys. Danish children and young people who cannot safely go out - cannot go out in peace - without the threat of violence and harassment from immigrant thugs. It doesn't work at all! And when it goes completely wrong - when it comes to sexual assaults and rapes, we are at the end of one of the most disgusting and reprehensible things that exists. That's why we must have much stricter penalties for this type of violence .And it must result in significantly increased punishment when the perpetrator films his victim.Racist dominance violence must be treated as a hate crime.We want a minimum sentence of five years of unconditional imprisonment.And if the perpetrator is not a Danish citizen, it must lead to deportation.Off the guard. We simply have to show that we are serious! 3. We must have a legal society with visible police and punishments that deter. This of course also requires that there are police nearby when there is a need for it. This is how it should be in our Denmark. We basically have a very good police today. Good solid people who make a good effort every day. But they lack resources. Time. Colleagues. And perhaps a management that recognizes to a greater extent what is important to the Danes. Many Danes have lost trust in, that the police come when we need it. It doesn't work! Far too many burglaries are not investigated at all. 95 out of 100 are never solved. trust that the police are there for us. The police have to handle many tasks. From visibility that acts as a preventive measure, presence when there is crime such as burglary to quick and tough intervention against the previously mentioned dominance violence, but also gang wars in the rock and drug environment. So there is plenty to look out for. Our talented police are under pressure. That is why the negotiations on the police's conditions, which are still ongoing, must end with more resources for the police. More officers. Who can be closer to the citizens. That is what we are fighting for. We want 300 more educated per year for the next four years. Double what the government wants. Just as we want to hold on to those we have. Instead, as the Social Democrats propose, to abolish the mounted police, which we otherwise was introduced a few years ago after many years of struggle. The mounted police are perfect for large gatherings. Both on the major trade routes but also at football matches and the like. Why abolish it? We dream of a country with justice. With punishments that work. I mentioned earlier our desire for harsher punishment for dominance violence. But I would also like to mention crazy driving as an example. Drivers who spread fear and horror by driving wildly fast. All too often with terrible consequences. Lives that are crushed by madness behind the wheel. Often are the driver a young person with an immigrant background. Often someone who is already known to the police. And often with short sentences. Someone who cuts through a small town at 154 kilometers an hour. With alcohol in his blood. Three lose their lives. The punishment? 3 years in prison. Is fair? I don't think so. The government will then increase the punishment by 50 percent in the worst cases. But is it enough to seriously tell these young people to stay away from crazy driving? I don't think so. On the other hand, I think that we must introduce a minimum sentence of, for example, 6 years for reckless driving. So we make it clear to these young people that their rampage on the roads is now over. And as a matter of course, the cars must be confiscated. And again: If the perpetrator is not a Danish citizen, then is deportation what applies! 4. You must be able to get an education, create a good life - in ALL of Denmark. In the Denmark we dream of, you can live a good life in ALL of Denmark. A country in balance. Where young people do not need to believe that you have to rush to the biggest cities to have the chance of a good life. Where it is possible to run a business - also when it comes to obtaining financing. Where young people can get an education - without having to travel to one of the 4 largest cities. Where you can safely buy a house, because you know that the area has a future and you can therefore sell your house again. We must keep telling each other that the good life is also outside the big cities. The good after all, life in the big city is not that more and more people are coming in! Big cities around the world have had enough and are trying in various ways to stop the influx. There are simply too many people in too little space. That is why it is in everyone's interest to ensure a balance in our country that means that the good life can be lived everywhere. It requires changes! The rules for mortgages and banks must ensure that there is the possibility of financing. Even outside the cities. Educational sites must be located geographically well distributed in the country, so that our young people can receive education close to where they grow up. There must be good infrastructure - both in relation to roads and public transport - but also with fast speeds on the internet. Why is it crazy that the government has decided to abolish the broadband pool. We must secure Danish retail. It is threatened like never before. Both generally of new trading patterns but also of a future with a multinational giant like Amazon, which in a few years will make its entrance and risk out-competing many of the stores we know today. A giant like Amazon, which typically does not pay Danish tax. Can undercut Danish traders, who also have costs for premises and employees. Who can achieve a monopoly-like status and thus set the prices as they want. No. We must ensure fair conditions for Danish shops. Fair competition. Otherwise we can well beckon advantage to lively and exciting Danish provincial towns. 5. In our Denmark it is safe to grow old. In the Denmark I want, you don't have to fear whether the help and care is there when you need it. Especially during the in the first phase of the corona shutdown in the spring, we saw that the elderly were being let down. That there was simply not the necessary political attention to the loneliness that was spreading. Many elderly people sat alone in real isolation without the usual contact with their loved ones. I spoke with many - especially relatives - who otherwise tried to cry out with good reason. Heartbreaking stories. Demented people who did not understand what happened and who believed that their relatives had failed them. It was as if the door to the nursing home was locked and threw the key away. Of course to avoid the elderly - people at risk - getting corona - but also with tragic experiences as a result. It must not happen again! Now we are facing Christmas. Still with corona in our society. So we have to take precautions , but we must also remember that for some of those who live in nursing homes, it may be their last Christmas. That is why a better balance must be found. stretch to the limit, so that no one will go through a Christmas in loneliness and in the feeling of failure. We must solve the task! And just as the state indemnifies the regions for extra costs as a result of corona, we must also ensure that the state does this towards the municipalities. And here extra costs as a result of measures to protect our vulnerable elderly must be counted! All in all, more must be done in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe elderly in the future. For example, we do not have enough care home places at all. According to the Elderly Case, we will lack 25,000 care homes for the next 10 years. Already today, a request for a place often has to be turned down - because there is a lack of places. Most people would like help to stay in their own home for as long as possible. But when the need arises, the possibility of a care home must be present. We simply want a guarantee for a place in a care home for the elderly over 80 years of age. If at that age you feel that you are only safe by living in a care home, you must have the right to do so. We want also minimum standards in care for the elderly. So that everywhere in the country a floor is ensured below, for example, the number of employees. Just as in these years it is introduced for childcare. It is good if the children are ensured better conditions, but the risk is that if we do not simultaneously introduce minimum standards in care for the elderly, resources and employees are brought from the care for the elderly and to the children's area. And we must not help the children by failing their grandparents! We must and must solve both tasks at the same time! And we must ensure a dignified economy for the elderly. We have changed the rules on set-off, which have given many pensioners a little more in the hands. We have removed the scheme with the rate pool, which year after year took from the pensioners' pockets. In the past, we introduced the old-age check and have continuously improved it. And now we propose to make the old-age check tax-free. Just like the child check, it already is. This will ensure that many of the elderly, who do not have much to worry about, will get a little extra freedom. And we will continue the fight for those pensioners who have the desire and the strength to continue on the labor market, get more out of it. 6. We must secure our values. Secure a country for future generations that is Danish. That is the dream. Because Denmark is changing. The composition of the population is changing. There are more and more Muslims background and that means that Denmark is changing. It is not good. We must have stopped that. If we just let it stand, projections show that in 30 years, people with a Muslim background will make up 16 percent of the population. More than doubling today. And this is even after we have significantly reduced the number of applicants to Denmark .Had we not got that, we would have looked like Sweden, where the projection shows that there is talk of approximately double-up compared to Denmark.Av av....But even if we thus stand with a significantly better starting point, there is reason to continue to warn about the future prospects. That is why we want a full stop to asylum. So that wandering through 6-7 safe countries and then finally coming to Denmark and applying for asylum does not give you the right to asylum. If you come from a safe country, you are a migrant and can be rejected. Must be rejected. And then we must have turned the trend on its head. So that more people who previously came to Denmark will return home. We must get the repatriation policy going. The last finance law we made - for 2019 - contained that innovation. A repatriation strategy. We secured the framework, but it is the day-to-day politics that must ensure the content. That repatriations actually take place. And here the social democratic government has unfortunately failed. They often say the right things, but infinitely little happens .On the contrary, they have made agreements with their parliamentary base that go against the possibility of repatriation. nothing happened. A year and a half wasted. So now they go around grinning and do pretty much whatever suits them. It is simply a mockery of the Danes. We must speak up. We must fight the creeping Islamization of our country. We must say stop for demands for religious special treatment. Where it is concerned that the pork must be taken out of the canteen. That girls and boys must be separated. That the class in the elementary school must no longer visit the church in December for the sake of Muslim children. We must stop the spread of mosques, calls to prayer in the public space. We must set new conditions for becoming Danish citizens. We must be able to opt out of halal slaughtered products. There is enough to deal with. Denmark is a Christian country. Our society is rounded out by the Christian cultural heritage. Denmark must be Danish - also in 30, 50 and 100 years. That is why we are fighting against the creeping Islamization. We have just launched a major new plan with a large number of concrete points. For Danish values. Against Islamization. It is a cultural battle, we are in the middle i. A battle we MUST win in order to secure the Denmark we dream of for the coming generations. Already now experts are out and judge our proposals to be contrary to convention. Ah yes. We must have heard that many times before. This network of faceless international lawyers and bureaucrats who want to decide what we can and can't do in our own country. Like a spider's web that can't really be seen - which we didn't want - but which places limits on our options. Where power is taken from the Folketing. Where the oxygen is sucked out of our democracy. It won't do! We must ensure self-determination so that we can set the course for the Denmark we want. The Danes must determine the development in Denmark! It's that simple! 7. But if we want to do that, we must also as point 7 free us from the EU's embrace. We must have a showdown with the EU. An EU that intervenes more and more in our everyday life. Have you thought that every time there is a crisis - now corona - the EU's response is: More The EU! The federalists use every opportunity to imagine that any problem is best solved by leaving it to people far away. Who speak other languages. And who pass things in forums where ordinary people are completely disconnected. New form of totalitarianism .Inversely with the nation-states.Where democracy and people's government work.Where you can talk directly to each other.Take stock of the political initiatives so that ordinary people can also interfere.As we have just seen with the mink scandal, where thousands of people from agriculture have told about their views on the government's violations of the law. Of course, we must cooperate with other countries. We have to deal with other countries. We have to solve the climate challenges in cooperation with other countries. But there is a decisive difference between that and letting the national state be replaced by a supranational enterprise, which then makes the decisions without the people. We have to say that to the front! We must ensure that the Danes are masters of their own house. That is why our dream is that we come out of the EU and have a different affiliation than today. 8. The Denmark I dream of is also a beautiful country. Where we look after our country .Field and meadow. Forest and beach. Taking care of the heritage from our ancestors. There are some who try to set up a contradiction between, for example, agriculture and taking care of our environment. It is a false contradiction. Those who live from agriculture, are usually those who are closest to nature. They want, if anything, that production and the environment go hand in hand. The discharges of polluted waste water we have seen from the big cities can perhaps put the debate into perspective. In our grandparents' generation it was a matter of course that you used everything on the pig when it was slaughtered. And the next day's menu was often based on leftovers from the day before. It is not from the country that we got the concept of food waste. So don't make it false premise that the educated people from the city want the environment and climate, while the uneducated people from the province have not understood what it is about. It does not hold! Instead, let's get started with the right solutions. Let's clean it up up in our so-called generational pollution.H√∏fde 42 on Harbo√∏re Tange.K√¶rg√•rd Klitplantage, where hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of waste water from the former Grindstedv√¶rket were dumped years ago.Colstrup ground in North Zealand.Himmark Strand on Nordals, where Danfoss - with the approval of the authorities - dumped large quantities waste and waste water. There is enough to deal with! And instead of saying that we must not eat meat - which the government suddenly started with in relation to the public canteens, let's research more climate-friendly production. The solution in a world where people demand meat, is not to drop it in Denmark, but to create a more environmentally friendly production. And let's take the necessary steps with realism and consideration. So that in order to save CO2 emissions in Denmark, we don't close down jobs, which then re-emerge in other countries. With the consequence that the climate has at best not gotten better, but perhaps outright got worse. There is so much at stake in the climate debate. The danger is that emotions are allowed to rule. That reason is put out of play The companies are fully prepared to cooperate here. As politicians, we must say thank you for that and then find solutions together. So we secure Danes' jobs - ensure those with small incomes that they will not be the losers when the new CO2 taxes are rolled out out. There is enough to address! These 8 points I have mentioned here will be the focal point for the Danish People's Party's political struggle in the coming years. Of course, there are also many other important questions, but I have listed here a number of those that we will particularly focus on. Simply because they are decisive for whether the dream we have for Denmark can be fulfilled.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî This year marks 25 years since we founded the Danish People's Party.

Then Poul was ready early the next morning with morning coffee and cheese meals , while he himself rushed to the office like a whirlwind to get everything ready for the morning group meeting.

54863.0," The EU prevents and delays Denmark's opportunity to provide support for renewable energy. It is completely unacceptable EU interference in Danish energy policy.

The Commission's attack on the Danish PSO scheme and the sabotage of several new support schemes for solar cells by the Commission emphasize that the time has come to put an end to the EU's interference in our opportunities to carry out the green transformation of our energy supply.- I will therefore encourage the prime minister to address this issue in his meetings with the EU summit. In this way, she can use her strong position in relation to a number of the EU's leaders to look after Danish interests and our opportunities to convert our energy supply to renewable energy.

56394.0,"It is also said that there is work that Danes will not take on. This is also why immigration is necessary <U+0096> otherwise we cannot get the necessary workforce, it says. These arguments are, of course, dubious. Before the change of government in 2011, the Danish People's Party therefore had it implemented that financial calculations should be made on these matters. This was unfortunately one of the things that changed with the Social Democrat-led government. They obviously do not want such calculations to be made! Wonder why? In Norway <U+0096>, which, by the way, is going to the polls today - they must obviously get such calculations. Some time ago it emerged that each and every non-Western immigrant costs Norwegian society 4.1 million kroner net - measured over an entire life course. In Norway <U+0094>Finansavisen<U+0094> has made a number of calculations, based on data from Statistisk Sentralbyr√• (SSB) <U+0096> among other things, in relation to how immigrants are integrated into the labor market. While, for example, a Swedish immigrant gives a plus to society, an average Somali costs Norwegian society nine million kroner net. A Pakistani costs DKK 5.1 million, while an Indian costs DKK 1.6 million. The figures assume that the immigrant's children become very well integrated into Norwegian society <U+0096> otherwise the costs run higher. The numbers <U+0096> and the way they appear ‚Äì can always be discussed. But as far as I can see, there is no doubt that the calculations show that immigration in general has absolutely nothing to do with solving our society's economic challenges. On the contrary, the economic difficulties are increased by the general immigration that we have seen in the last 30 years. From 2001 to 2011 <U+0096> when the Danish People's Party had greater influence - it therefore became a goal to turn immigration to Denmark so that more people came who could make a positive contribution to the economy. To ensure that more people came that Danish society needed. Highly educated or people for areas where we lacked manpower. After all, this is a different objective than the current government is pursuing. Now the asylum numbers have skyrocketed again. The family reunifications will follow the same path. As we also saw in the 90s. The argument is that this is how it is when there are wars in the world. But will we be better able to help people in need if Danish society is made poorer? No, of course not. Therefore, Denmark <U+0096> at the same time as we comply with our international obligations and provide protection to persons who are truly personally persecuted in their own countries - must be careful about turning refugees into immigrants, just as we must ensure that with our efforts helps more people than today. The way it works now, the people smugglers have crowned days. At the same time, it is the strongest, those who can afford and have the human resources to get themselves transported to Denmark, who come to the front of the queue for Danish society's help. How anyone manages to turn it into something particularly charitable is completely incomprehensible to me. Take Syria as an example. At some point, what can best be described as a civil war must end. In one way or another. This probably means that the country will need all good forces to rebuild the infrastructure and build a new civil society. In other words, qualified labor is needed. Therefore, our help should consist of <U+0096> together with other western countries <U+0096> providing for the many people on the run by establishing refugee camps in the surrounding areas. It is not only here that help makes the most sense, it is also here that as many people as possible can be helped. A war creates acute distress and urgent needs. They must be resolved on the spot. That is why the Danish People's Party has supported the grants that the government wanted to be able to help the refugees in the immediate area. In the first instance, a refugee camp is a place where basic needs such as food, shelter and medical care are met. But the refugee camps must also become places where people on the run are helped to cope with life when they return. The point is the banal one that in this way we can help far more people than we would otherwise be able to. Denmark's asylum policy is today effectively characterized by the law of the jungle. The strongest <U+0096> the person who manages to get to Denmark <U+0096> is the one we help the most. This means that the effort for many people is reduced. The current government is letting things develop in the wrong direction. Mixes refugee policy and immigration policy. Often tries to claim that immigration is generally an economic benefit <U+0096> even though it is so clearly not true. One of the first things the government abolished after taking office was the points system that the previous government and the Danish People's Party had introduced. The points system was supposed to ensure that more immigrants came, which Danish society needed. That policy is also pursued in countries such as Canada and Australia <U+0096> without attracting any serious attention. We must separate asylum policy and immigration policy. Asylum seekers must be helped <U+0096> preferably in nearby areas. Getting ready to return to build their own countries. Immigrants must be able to come to Denmark under certain conditions. But preferably immigrants who can be of help to Danish society, so that immigration does not increase our economic challenges. In short, we must pursue an immigration policy which benefits as many people as possible <U+0096> and which is also livable for Danish society. It makes no sense to put our own welfare under pressure with the wrong policy. Because who will we even be able to help in the future?

55707.0," As I was told during my speech on Thursday evening, when the result was clear, the Danes have shown themselves to be smarter than many in Christiansborg had thought. I have no doubt that a large majority of Danes want broad-based cooperation on the things that make good sense to cooperate on. That this collaboration should preferably take place in the EU. But that at the same time it must be a collaboration that does not develop more and more decisively. A collaboration that deprives one's own country more and more of the right to self-determination. The EU has stated in its purpose clause that the goal is an ever narrower union. And the Yes parties in the Folketing have written as a background for the vote on Thursday that the goal for them is for Denmark to be as close to the core of the EU as possible. I do not think such objectives are suitable for creating broad support among the Danes for the EU course. There were many of us who had a really good evening last Thursday. Because we had thrown in all our efforts to ensure a no thanks and thereby maintain our self-determination. Thanks to all the good forces that worked to make it a no. Whether you have contributed big or small is not that important. The important thing is that you have committed yourself to securing Denmark's future. And what will the future look like? Yes, in the short term, it is about us together ensuring that Denmark continues in Europol cooperation. Today and tomorrow, Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen will meet with the parties of the Danish Parliament, so he has a clear mandate in his suitcase when he travels to Brussels on Friday to meet with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU President Donald Tusk. From the Danish People's Party's side, our position is clear: We want a parallel agreement on Europol. And that is the message that we took to the meeting with the prime minister. Of course, we now expect the government to work loyally, hard and seriously to get a parallel agreement concluded, and we are of course following developments closely, so we know that this will also happen. Because regardless of what some on the yes side have said during the election campaign, it is hard to imagine that there would be no interest in continuing to include Denmark in police cooperation in the EU. In the longer term, the vote should prompt reflection by the EU-enthusiastic majority in the Danish Parliament. An EU policy should be made which enjoys broad support among the Danes. The idea that Denmark should apply to the core of the EU must therefore be changed. It must have dawned on everyone that a large part of the Danes want a different direction. It is obvious that what a majority in Parliament wants is not the same as what a majority of the population wants. It should be the basis for the long-term discussion about Denmark's relationship with the EU. And of course I very much welcome this discussion. Because, in my view, there is no doubt that Denmark must move away from the EU course that we have been on so far. We simply must have more Denmark and less EU.

57299.0," This week saw yet another relaxation of the immigration policy. The Social Democrats and their supporting parties agreed to raise benefits for families on integration benefits and cash benefits. Although the social democratic minister did everything at the presentation to wrap up the increases in nice and soft words and called the increase an extraordinary ""child allowance"", he could not hide the fact that the increase is actually an additional allowance for primarily immigrants. 63 percent of the families who get more money in their hands as a result of the agreement are foreigners and measured by the number of children, the figure is even higher. Thus, the Social Democrats have once again done exactly what they otherwise promised they would NOT do: They ease the immigration policy by raising benefits. We know that higher benefits and a relaxed immigration policy increase the risk of more migrants to Denmark. It simply makes Denmark more attractive to apply to. We saw in 2015 how big a role the benefits play when the migrants walked on the Danish motorways. Most wanted to move on to Sweden - and many answered precisely the desire for higher benefits when they were asked why. Mette Frederiksen must be very careful not to create a new Helle Thorning. Promise the Danes one thing and implement something completely different. Before the election in June, Mette Frederiksen even went so far as to promise that she would not want to be prime minister if she had to relax the immigration policy. But that is exactly what is happening these months. And it shows once again how dangerous it is when Radical Liberals gain influence. They don't care about Denmark. They don't mind our borders. This is also one of the reasons why we in the Danish People's Party are somewhat reluctant in relation to Jakob Ellemann Jensen as candidate for chairman of the Liberal Party. Partly because it is of course the Liberals themselves who must choose their new leadership. We must not interfere in that. We must only look at the political consequences it may have. But also partly because we remember that Jakob Ellemann Jensen resigned from Venstre in 2007 in protest against the immigration policy that Venstre pursued together with the Danish People's Party. And what kind of political course will he set for the Liberal Party if he becomes chairman on 21 September? Let's hope he has gained a lot of experience since then. That we can count on the Liberal Party, with him as chairman, to continue working with us on the strict immigration policy. After all, the Left is a party that ranges widely. From Inger St√∏jberg, with whom we have an excellent collaboration, to Jan E. J√∏rgensen, who can easily sound like a member of Radikale Venstre (which I think he is not even sorry for me writing). Therefore, it is important for us that we know that the Left stands firm when it counts. And helps us to keep Denmark on the right course in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãimmigration. And that suggests that there will be enough to clean up after this government with supporting parties has been in office for a few years... I hope that there is broad agreement among the bourgeois parties that we have to maintain an immigration policy that secures Denmark. Also continue the line of an active repatriation policy, which we took the first step towards with the Finance Act for this year. And not least that we agree to keep the Social Democrats on their promises. In just a few months, the Social Democrats have already managed to short-circuit the decision that refugees must go home when there is peace in their homeland. They want to accept quota refugees again, they set up the benefits and then they have also eased the conditions for rejected asylum seekers, who otherwise have nothing to do in Denmark anymore! It is incredible that they have been able to achieve so many relaxations even before the parliamentary year has even started! The Danish People's Party is ready for close cooperation among the bourgeois parties in order to maintain a strict immigration policy - this is the result of the Social Democrats letting the immigration policy slide....

53639.0," KristianThulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter - Tuesday 27 October 2015 Must reality reach the leading politicians? Then it stopped working. The Swedish government had to acknowledge last week that the country can no longer withstand the asylum pressure and now the so-called<U+0094>humanitarian superpower<U+0094> wants to tighten its immigration policy. With recent years' Swedish campaign in mind, you know that the Swedish politicians minus the Sweden Democrats are only tightening because it is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, something like this has been completely unheard of on this side of the strait. But what is happening in Sweden is also crazy. This year, the country expects to receive up to 190,000 asylum seekers. The bill is 27.5 billion Swedish kroner and next year the expenses are expected to rise to a staggering 60 billion Swedish kroner. In comparison, according to Jyllands-Posten, Sweden spends 64 billion Swedish kroner annually on its hospital system. The verdict from associate professor and expert in international migration Joakim Ruist from the School of Economics at the University of Gothenburg is also clear:<U+0094>The expenses for Sweden will not be paid back - not even if they find work. It is thus wishful thinking when the Swedish government talks about taking in refugees as an investment in the future that will pay for itself. Because the money will not be paid back. It has not happened historically and it will not happen in the future, as all the simple jobs are no longer available in Sweden. Therefore, it will be expensive for the public sector and therefore there will be less money for other things such as schools, care for the elderly and hospitals<U+0094>. So much for the bleak future prospects. But how does the service look in Sweden right now? The housing shortage is enormous, everything is taken up and it is rumored that Swedish young people today have to wait 5-8 years to get an apartment. In addition, a study shows that the bill for asylum immigration is already taking its toll on welfare in 33 Scanian municipalities. And then, on top of that, I have only described the financial aspects. After all, there are also other and very well-known problems in a one-immigration policy that opens up a country to so many hard-to-integrate immigrants. But if you were to think that the above would cause the leading politicians in Sweden to take a more realistic view of how the flow of refugees and migrants should generally be handled, then you would be sadly mistaken. Quite recently, the Swedish Prime Minister, the Social Democrat Stefan L√∂fven, said: <U+0094>Sweden will not just continue to accept its share as long as other countries do not do theirs. It is not possible for Austria, Germany and Sweden to take in refugees <U+0096> and Sweden has actually taken in the most per capita <U+0096> if all countries do not accept their responsibility. Now this is serious. Sweden cannot do everything<U+0094>. Put in Danish: The other countries must do what Sweden has done so far, while Sweden takes a breather. But what then, Stefan L√∂fven, when the other countries have taken as many as Sweden and are in problems on the same scale as Sweden is experiencing right now? No, politicians throughout Europe, including in Denmark, must realize that what is happening right now cannot continue. That the current situation calls for completely different ways of handling things. In the EU, people are working on distribution quotas, but that doesn't solve anything. Because it is not a matter of if the EU takes in a million people, it will stop forever. No, what we see are migrations that will only continue if we don't say stop. But the absolute political top in the EU will not realize the seriousness of the situation. Simply because you will not be willing to take the initiatives that logically follow. They have come up with different patching solutions. People still imagine that the case of asylum seekers is processed in an EU country. But it still means that it is the people smugglers who have reason to smile. If it were seriously decided that aid to refugees and migrants should be given to the inner regions - and you could not pay your way into the EU, then you would seriously want to create a new situation. Could help more people at the same time as maintaining European societies as we know them. Something suggests that there is trouble in Sweden. In Poland, the voters have just chosen to change government i.a. to give the EU a fight. Hungary is still struggling for understanding about their border controls. So something happens then.

55509.0," Today, Sunday, a week ago, the newspapers were packed with one interview after another with former prime minister and left-wing chairman Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen's new book came out on Monday - and he gave it a good deal of attention... L√∏kke's main point in all these interviews was that the Liberal Party should scrap cooperation with, among other things, Danish People's Party and instead initiate closer cooperation with the Radical Left. In the middle of the election campaign last year, Lars L√∏kke also published a book. At the time, he launched the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Left. And in the final phase of the election campaign, he then also included De Radikale in the maneuver. It caused deep astonishment - not least in L√∏kke Rasmussen's own party. And the idea never got off the ground either. The Social Democrats immediately shot down any thought of an SV government. But Lars L√∏kke is trying to lure bourgeois Denmark into a dead end with his call. And I actually think he is aware of that. For De Radikale is not a party that will be able to point to a bourgeois government. Their hinterland ‚Äì and their voters ‚Äì are value-politically far to the left and close to SF and Enhedslisten. So the bourgeois Denmark with De Radikale is a bourgeois Denmark that, for example, scraps a strict immigration policy and becomes lax on law and order. And it is obviously not a project that will have our support. In addition, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen is far too quick to throw in the towel in relation to the belief in a bourgeois majority again. Because even though it may look difficult right now, you have to remember that there has been a bourgeois majority in Denmark for 14 of the last 19 years. So why can't it be done again? And especially when daily life after the corona state of emergency really shows itself! In DF, we have over time made political agreements with all parties. We have no good feelings if we can agree on the political content. We certainly also like to do concrete politics with De Radikale. But basing government cooperation ‚Äì and thus Denmark's future ‚Äì on De Radikale is bullshit! Immigration policy is absolutely crucial for Denmark's future. For which country we pass on to our children and grandchildren. And on this crucial point, Det Radikale Venstre is not a compromise-seeking center party, but a party that belongs to the extreme left. In reality, a rather extremist party that, if the party had gained power as they have expected, would have steered Denmark into a nightmare scenario ala Sweden. There is a reason why the Radicals bet heavily on winning voters in the ghettos in the last election. It is a party whose policy leads directly to increased immigration and increased Islamization of Danish society. Radical in the true sense of the word. And it is of course a message that has appeal in the parallel societies where Islam comes before Denmark. So, dear Lars L√∏kke: The Radical Way is a dead end for bourgeois Denmark! Therefore, I will also be pleased that the current leadership in the Liberal Party has rejected your delusions. In 2001, the goal of the Left was to get a bourgeois majority without the Radicals. The Radicals were no longer to rule Danish politics, as they had done for decades. That should also be the goal here in 2020. The second only points the way to a dead end for bourgeois Denmark! We must not follow that path‚Ä¶.

54850.0," The government is expanding its interpretation of what Danish development funds are used for in Denmark. It is an unsympathetic and short-term approach. It costs the surrounding areas, sends more refugees towards Denmark and damages our reputation. What is reasonable to cover in Danish development aid? The question is sadly topical, after the government has presented its 2025 plan and has once again shifted the framework for Danish decency. Already, the government has greatly increased the use of DAC funds, also for expenses in the municipalities well after the asylum phase and clearly at the limit of what the DAC rules allow. The SR government used the same criteria for a limited number of refugees, but with the government's new practice, billions of kroner are removed from efforts in Syria's surrounding areas and elsewhere. Now the screw is tightened even more and completely new areas are introduced, which are clearly at ‚Äì and I believe over ‚Äì the limit of what follows from the DAC rules, including secretarial assistance to the Refugee Board and repatriation. The individual exercise will cost the world's poorest 400 million kroner a year. Annual. Impossible to figure out the calculation method And why doesn't the OECD come after the government, when you are now going so much on the edge of the rules? Because the OECD itself is in the process of negotiating a new set of rules. Because the organisation's sanctions options are limited - and because the OECD is a member organization that is very reluctant to engage in a polemical debate with individual member states. When Denmark takes the lead, there is, however, a great risk that other countries will follow, and that the world's total aid to the surrounding areas and other places in need will pay the price in the form of a marked decrease in international aid. The whole thing is made worse by the fact that it is virtually impossible to find out how Inger St√∏jberg's ministry actually calculates these figures. From quarter to quarter, there are enormous fluctuations in the estimated numbers, and although the government now expects 10,000 asylum seekers instead of 25,000 in 2016, from the 2nd to the 3rd quarter of this year, the relative share of pre-asylum expenses has been de facto turned up violently in the convenient shelter of the fact that the absolute number of asylum seekers is falling. The Folketing has never been involved. Regardless of how you ask, the ministry remains one big black box in relation to this issue. It is simply impossible to see how the ministry can constantly use relatively more aid money in Denmark, mind you, without a political position being taken in the Folketing to this effect at any time. In my view, there is therefore nothing else to do but for the Danish Parliament, in connection with the upcoming negotiations on a new development strategy, to take care of the Danish aid itself and introduce a ceiling of, for example, ten percent of the Danish aid that can go to pre-asylum expenses. It cannot be right that one of the world's richest countries should continue to be the biggest recipient of our own developing country aid.

55854.0," And I will be happy when Denmark does well in the world of sports. It shows that even though we are a small country, we can easily do great things. There is no reason to feel small, because on the sporting level, as in so many other areas, we are actually doing really well in relation to our population. For example, there are about fifteen times as many people living in Germany as in Denmark, and yet we beat them 2-0 in the EC final in football on a lovely June evening in 1992. This triggered scenes of jubilation all over Denmark, the likes of which have probably never been seen since liberation. There are those who would terribly like to sell out our sovereignty and our identity. They believe that when some of us love Denmark and Danishness, it is an expression of <U+0094>national chauvinism<U+0094>. However, the global economic crisis has meant that the EU enthusiasts and the globalists are currently keeping a low profile. And I write <U+0094>low profile<U+0094>, because unfortunately I don't think that the groups mentioned have become wiser. The ju-hu-globalists seem to forget that they are a significant minority. I am convinced that the vast majority of us feel like Danes before anything else. This is also why 1.4 million watched the World Cup qualifying match between Denmark and Portugal on TV last September. We don't have the same desire to see a match between, for example, Portugal and Hungary. The two teams mean less to us for good reasons, because we are Danes! To paint the picture completely, who would want to see an EU team? A national team from the <U+0094>United States of Europe<U+0094>, where there would hardly be a single Dane on it. And it wouldn't even be because there wasn't a Danish footballer who was good enough, but rather because the bigger states would demand to get their players on the team. There would probably be national politics in the team setting, where each individual nation would fight for its own interests. Does that scenario remind you a bit of the way the EU works today? But luckily, all that is just wishful thinking. We are our own nation, have our own identity and our own national team, and so do other European states. Therefore, many Danes will enthusiastically follow our boys in South Africa. I hereby wish our national team great luck on the road!

54678.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter <U+0096> Monday 26 September 2016 The politicians are out of step with the Danes! There is a grotesquely large and growing distrust between the population and the politicians in recent years. You can read it in today's edition of Berlingske. We have to go back 25 years to find a similar bottom level. I understand it! Just think back to the past four-year period. The Danes were placed one after the other in view. It started when the S-SF coalition with Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Villy S√∏vndal were to win power together. All children should have a free PC. It should be much cheaper to travel by bus and train. All school children were to have free food. The pensioners, wage earners, kindergartens and many others should have much more money. But the money was not there and the promises were broken. In January 2012 BT was thus able to publish an article with the extremely telling headline: <U+0094> 100 broken promises in 100 days<U+0094>. Yes, isn't the <U+0094>Promise-breaking government<U+0094>, as the government was called before the last election, a fair share of the responsibility for the fact that many do not feel trust in the politicians? I believe it - and I understand it. Perhaps the political system has learned from that? Something suggests that. In any case, it is less bombastic promises that are flowing through the media stream right now. It has probably been too clear what happened in the years 2011 to 2015. So most people are aware that it is not something that needs to be repeated. But the above is only an explanation of the Danes' greater distrust of the political system. Another, and probably even more disturbing, is that the political system seems out of step with the population in crucial areas of political value. Many of the concerns that the Danes have are swept aside by reference to EU rules or conventions An example. When many Danes want permanent border control, they find that this wish is more or less automatically rejected with reference to the Schengen rules. Which then stops a real discussion about whether we should decide on permanent border control. And yes, Denmark is part of the Schengen cooperation, but it is something that has been politically decided and can be changed, just as the content of Schengen can be changed. But if the political system reacts to a popular desire for border control as if the rules are set in granite and are not up for discussion, then the political system distances itself from the population and mistrust is created. Or when foreigners commit crimes ‚Äì and even repeated crimes ‚Äì and still cannot be deported with reference to the conventions‚Äù. When proposals that such criminal aliens should be sent out of the country are met with a ""we don't want to break the conventions"", after which all debate about the reasonableness of the way the rules are designed stops. Yes ‚Äì then the political system distances itself from the population. Or when EU citizens of other countries have the right to Danish welfare benefits practically from day one in this country, and many Danes express that it is not fair! But if it is swept off the track that such are the EU rules, after which the debate stops, yes - then the political system distances itself from the population. Not because there aren't Danes who are in favor of a borderless Europe - because there are. Not because there aren't Danes who believe that criminal foreigners should stay in Denmark - because there are. Not because there aren't Danes who believe that, for example, Romanians and Bulgarians etc. are welcome to the Danish welfare system from day &eacute ‚Äì because there are! We are happy to have that discussion. But the problem is that the debate stops already with reference to agreements with other countries. And the large majority of Danes who believe that it is now going too far are swept off the field. When the politicians thus do not take the people's wishes and concerns seriously and to a large extent let it be understood that one just has to put up with it - it cannot be changed - then it is clear that a gap of distrust between politicians and the population arises. That the frustrations grow due to a feeling of powerlessness. That the Danes feel that it is no longer they who decide, but are subject to the EU, the conventions and so on. That there is a general feeling that we are no longer master of our own house. That we are not in control! This is the real worry. And this must be responded to. The faster the better! Because the politicians are out of step with the Danes.

56265.0," I admit that the payment ring is one of the government's biggest problems here and now <U+0096> the case has developed into a pure nightmare, now that it is clear to everyone that the project is only about saving Foreign Minister Villy S√∏vndals political life. In other words, ordinary wage earners must pay a high price to ensure that at least the &eacute of the Socialist People's Party's pre-election promises become reality. But unfortunately the debate about the payment ring and the government's other tax and tax orgy overshadows something that in the long term will be far more fateful for Denmark: Namely the fact that the government and a majority will join the EU fiscal pact with the stroke of a pen and thus will bind himself hand and foot. And of course without asking the population whether it really agrees that Danish fiscal policy will in future be dictated by non-elected EU Commissioners. What happens when you put commissioners in charge, the Greeks feel on their own bodies. In Athens sits a puppet government appointed by the EU, which has been tasked with saving the last bit of life out of the desperate Greek population. You scrimp and save. One reform after another is adopted, while the Greeks sink further and further into bottomless poverty. The well-educated are leaving their homeland in droves, while poor mothers are in some cases forced to entrust their children to charitable institutions because they can no longer afford to feed them themselves. But the EU remains relentless and constantly makes new demands. Instead of recognizing that precisely the common currency, the euro, is blocking all of Greece's opportunities to work its way out of the crisis and create growth <U+0096> and worse is in the process of destroying all of the country's future opportunities <U+0096> sits The EUROcrats with blinders on and acting like nothing. Because they know that their entire political utopia stands and falls on the survival of the euro. The Danish government shares the crazy utopia. So much so that it believes that it is in the Danes' interest to tie us even closer to the common bankruptcy currency. The absurdity of the Fiscal Pact is underlined by the fact that only six EU countries live up to its requirements. Denmark is already doomed in advance due to our loss of market share on the international export markets as well as the Danes' high debt. There is no indication that the loss of market share will decrease with the government's current destructive business policy <U+0096> nor that the Danes' debt problems will decrease when unemployment rises and house prices plummet. Danish participation in the fiscal pact therefore immediately seems like pure economic and political suicide. I myself had the opportunity to visit the EU Parliament in Strasbourg during last week's session. Here I really experienced the gap between the EU-enthusiastic members of parliament and the group of skeptics and opponents to which the Danish People's Party belongs in the EFD Group (European Freedom and Democracy).

Otherwise, Nigel Farage had the greatest understanding that the Greeks have no other options to express their frustration than to demonstrate in the streets.

56265.0," I admit that the payment ring is one of the government's biggest problems here and now <U+0096> the case has developed into a pure nightmare, now that it is clear to everyone that the project is only about saving Foreign Minister Villy S√∏vndals political life. In other words, ordinary wage earners must pay a high price to ensure that at least the &eacute of the Socialist People's Party's pre-election promises become reality. But unfortunately the debate about the payment ring and the government's other tax and tax orgy overshadows something that in the long term will be far more fateful for Denmark: Namely the fact that the government and a majority will join the EU fiscal pact with the stroke of a pen and thus will bind himself hand and foot. And of course without asking the population whether it really agrees that Danish fiscal policy will in future be dictated by non-elected EU Commissioners. What happens when you put commissioners in charge, the Greeks feel on their own bodies. In Athens sits a puppet government appointed by the EU, which has been tasked with saving the last bit of life out of the desperate Greek population. You scrimp and save. One reform after another is adopted, while the Greeks sink further and further into bottomless poverty. The well-educated are leaving their homeland in droves, while poor mothers are in some cases forced to entrust their children to charitable institutions because they can no longer afford to feed them themselves. But the EU remains relentless and constantly makes new demands. Instead of recognizing that precisely the common currency, the euro, is blocking all of Greece's opportunities to work its way out of the crisis and create growth <U+0096> and worse is in the process of destroying all of the country's future opportunities <U+0096> sits The EUROcrats with blinders on and acting like nothing. Because they know that their entire political utopia stands and falls on the survival of the euro. The Danish government shares the crazy utopia. So much so that it believes that it is in the Danes' interest to tie us even closer to the common bankruptcy currency. The absurdity of the Fiscal Pact is underlined by the fact that only six EU countries live up to its requirements. Denmark is already doomed in advance due to our loss of market share on the international export markets as well as the Danes' high debt. There is no indication that the loss of market share will decrease with the government's current destructive business policy <U+0096> nor that the Danes' debt problems will decrease when unemployment rises and house prices plummet. Danish participation in the fiscal pact therefore immediately seems like pure economic and political suicide. I myself had the opportunity to visit the EU Parliament in Strasbourg during last week's session. Here I really experienced the gap between the EU-enthusiastic members of parliament and the group of skeptics and opponents to which the Danish People's Party belongs in the EFD Group (European Freedom and Democracy). The chairman of the EFD Group, the Englishman Nigel Farage, addressed the plenary hall directly to the President of the European Council <U+0094>President<U+0094> Herman Van Rompuy and Commission President Barroso with an appeal for the EU to release Greece from the euro. Otherwise, Nigel Farage had the greatest understanding that the Greeks have no other options to express their frustration than to demonstrate in the streets.

56427.0," The newly renovated county council hall was jam-packed when Morten √òstergaard had called a members' meeting at Christiansborg. Just under 200 radical members had turned up to hear the radical leader as well as Sofie Carsten Nielsen and Manu Sareen give an update on the political situation and participate in the current debate. By Julie Dyre Aagaard The three radical ministers duly welcomed those present and invited the audience to ask questions. Tragic events filled a lot Top of mind among many of the participants were naturally the tragic events surrounding the terrorist attacks in Copenhagen on the weekend of 14-15. February. There was broad agreement in the room that the government and not least the radical leadership had handled the terrorist case well, but that there was also a need for reflection after the incident. From the hall it was said, among other things: ""We must be careful that it is not the right wing that supports the Jews, while the Muslims get support from the left wing."" Economy and Interior Minister Morten √òstergaard's answer was that for the Radical Left it is not about choosing between religions, but rather about creating a society where everyone across religions can live in security and practice the religion they want. From the audience, Sofie Carsten Nielsen was asked: ""Why isn't an imam training program set up in Denmark that ensures that imams are trained based on Danish values?"" To this, the Minister of Education replied that they have previously worked on setting up the same education themselves, but have run into various obstacles along the way. Social Affairs Minister Manu Sareen added that they have looked at the experiences from the Netherlands, which have turned out to be not particularly good: ""The wish is to give young people an answer from the Koran in a Danish context. But it is also important that those who are trained can also be employed. The big problem will be whether mosques will employ imams trained in Denmark. It is important that we ensure that there will also be demand for the courses that are offered,"" explained the minister. Ambitions beyond character race Although the terrorist case thus filled a lot, there was also room for reflections on other political issues. In the field of education, Sofie Carsten Nielsen received the following question from the audience: ""Should one not follow the recommendations that have come from the quality report, which states that higher education should require a maximum average of 7? The situation right now means that many people focus on grades and thus do not get to develop other important skills.‚Äù To this, the minister replied that this particular topic is of great concern to her, as the current situation leads to a character race, which is not beneficial either for students, families or society. She added that it all starts in youth education, and that it is in higher education that we should look at how to admit young people: ""We must look at competences more broadly than the narrow 12th grade. There are so many other qualities that come into play when entering the labor market. It's not about lowering the bar, but instead having greater ambitions that go beyond grades alone,"" said Sofie Carsten Nielsen Improved conditions for asylum seekers Several of the evening's attendees asked about another hot topic, namely the area of ‚Äã‚Äãasylum and refugees. A question from the audience read: ""Shouldn't we take better care of our asylum seekers, our young people and everyone who lives in Denmark, regardless of religious affiliation?"" To this, Morten √òstergaard replied that during the 10 years he has been in Parliament, the asylum area is the area he has dealt with the most. And that conditions have significantly improved during that period. ""Our case processing time, for example, is now significantly shorter than in the countries we normally compare ourselves to,"" emphasized the radical leader, while taking a new question from the floor.

55329.0," ""Since 2010, the EU has forced Greece onto an economic course that made things worse, and therefore the Greek no is not a surprise. On the contrary, it is a victory for democracy over the neoliberal austerity policy,"" says Rasmus Nordqvist, who is political spokesman for Alternativet. It was a very clear Greek election, where over 60 per cent. of the votes said no thanks to the harsh austerity course that the EU has set out for the country that hatched democracy as a form of government. While the situation for Greece is somewhat uncertain, the Greek no should be an important lesson for the EU, believes Rasmus Nordqvist: ""The EU must learn from the Greek referendum and find a new and better solution that stems from a completely different way of thinking about the economy . For example, it was anything but drastic austerity that helped the USA out of the Great Depression, and the IMF itself has warned against austerity policy,"" says political spokesman for the Alternative, Rasmus Nordqvist, and continues: ""The EU has time and again tightened the screws on the Greeks , and that could have only one consequence. The proposed conditions look more like stupid fines than anything else, and it is indeed paradoxical that the EU chooses such a course for Greece, when large parts of Europe received huge aid after the Second World War. The EU must wake up, realize their failed policy and ensure that the Greeks now receive the help for reconstruction that the situation has long called for,"" concludes Rasmus Nordqvist.

53819.0," The last half of the winter holiday was spent finding out who knew what about the treatment of between 400 and 500 stateless Palestinians' right to Danish citizenship. Integration Minister Birthe R√∏nn Hornbech laid down on his face and called it incomprehensible that a mistake could take place, while the Institute for Human Rights claims to have drawn attention to the problems since 2006. The fact is that by joining a UN convention on stateless persons from 1954 allegedly undertook to grant citizenships to stateless persons on more lenient terms than in ordinary citizenship proceedings. This implies, among other things, that criminal persons also have a <U+0094>claim<U+0094> to become Danish citizens <U+0096> and thus a claim to become Danes. Regardless of how much of a shame it is for the stateless that they are stateless, this is pure, borderline madness! While an otherwise honorable person seems to have difficulty obtaining Danish citizenship because of the laws and regulations we now have, a criminal Palestinian can overtake him within a few seconds and itself a citizenship on the basis of a convention created in a world traumatized by the horrors of two world wars and which experienced horrific ethnic cleansing and displacement of people. In Denmark, we must necessarily ask ourselves this question: Should a UN convention be above the Constitution, which states that Danish citizenship can only be granted by law ‚Äì that is, by the Folketing ‚Äì or should the UN issue Danish citizenships? Not surprisingly, professor of constitutional law from the University of Copenhagen, Henning Koch, denies that there is a violation of the constitution because Denmark has joined the convention. His rationale is that, formally speaking, it is still the Folketing that grants citizenships, but he forgets to add that the Folketing has thus been reduced to a mere dispatch office for the UN. Furthermore, he states that the Danish Parliament has given its consent to the conventions, and that there is therefore nothing to follow. Now, I have never had the big scam for Henning Koch. It was Henning Koch, who even before the election in 2001 participated in the howl against the Danish People's Party and believed that my statements against fundamentalist Islam should be fought, and that he also heard <U+0094>tones from 1930<U+0094>. When it was announced in 2008 that two Tunisians had intended to murder the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, Henning Koch fought tooth and nail against the so-called notification obligation for deported foreigners on tolerated stays. According to Henning Koch, such an obligation to report was in violation of human rights. It made me then write that Henning Koch is nothing more than <U+0094>a wandering political opinion machine disguised in scientific garb<U+0094>. And I still mean it. Henning Koch is permanently enraged that the Danish People's Party and the current government managed to reverse course in the field of immigration without violating a single international convention. His joy is now all the greater at being able to put a finger on the government's and the Danish People's Party's policy. My assignment is not a detailed analysis of whether we have broken the UN Convention on Stateless Persons in the current case. My errand is common sense and logic. I simply do not want to accept that any convention should be able to force Denmark to grant citizenship to criminal people. We must have a thorough review of the conventions we have joined. Do they fulfill their purpose? Are they up to date? Do they benefit Denmark? At the same time, we will propose to the government that in future Denmark joins conventions on a yearly basis. Conventions must simply have an expiry date. Once the expiry date has been reached, the Convention no longer applies. We must then evaluate the convention's fingerprints on concrete, Danish decisions that have been taken by the Folketing <U+0096> or decided by Danish authorities on the basis of the convention. We must examine what consequences, large and small, acceding to the convention has had. Has it been good or bad for Denmark? If it has been good <U+0096> or without significance <U+0096>, the Folketing can join again for a new term. If it is bad, then the last sale date has been exceeded, the convention is out of force and in that case the Parliament must of course not accede to it again. The conventions and their interpretation are in several cases completely outdated. They came into being in the wake of two world wars and two murderous political ideologies with millions of human lives on their conscience. But also a world characterized by anxiety about the future, by the fear of a devastating nuclear war and of course with a strong desire for a better and fairer world. The 1950s were &eacute time <U+0096> The 2010s are, to put it mildly, a different one. Put another way: Time and reality have run away from conventions. Living, present politics in a national people's government can, should and must not allow itself to be limited by international conventions. The conventions are based on abstract ideals, while the reality of the nations is concrete. In Denmark, it is the politicians' task to look after the Danes' interests instead of bowing to abstract thinking. The interests of the Danes and Denmark are constantly changing, just as the world is changing rapidly <U+0096> therefore we must have checked the conventions now. And may I be free, by the way, when Integration Minister Birthe R√∏nn Hornbech apologetically says, <U+0094>rather one too many than one too little<U+0094> in relation to the distribution of citizenships. That's not how a responsible politician talks. The responsible politician will instead change the law so that these mistakes cannot take place.

53772.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter - Monday 24 June 2013 The Somali rapist must be deported! In a completely incomprehensible judgment for me and, I think, most Danes, the Western High Court has chosen to cancel the district court's deportation sentence of a Somali rapist and make it conditional. The Somali man thus avoided deportation when the Vestre Landsret decided by a vote of 4 to 2 that he can stay here in Denmark after serving his sentence. According to normal practice, he can then be gradually released after he has served only half of his short six-year sentence, which he was sentenced to for rape and attempted rape. I must honestly say that this judgment from the Western High Court has shocked me deeply in my sense of justice. It simply cannot be right and I very much hope that the prosecution will appeal the case <U+0096> it can be reached yet! The case will then be brought before the Supreme Court, which will then have the opportunity to determine whether the Western District Court made a wrong assessment when they handed down the judgment and thus overruled the district court, or whether the legislation is simply not strict enough as it is today. There is no doubt that we in Denmark are generally too bad at deporting criminal foreigners. Today, far too much emphasis is placed on the so-called attachment to Denmark, rather than the country's legitimate claim to be protected from abuse by people from outside. In the specific case, it is, on top of that, a lenient interpretation of some already too lenient criteria for deporting criminal aliens, which, as I said, means that the judgment should be appealed to the Supreme Court without hesitation. In the Danish People's Party, our position is completely clear. It should not be a foreigner's so-called attachment to Denmark that must determine whether the person in question must be deported in connection with a conviction for serious crime. It is solely a question of whether a foreigner commits a serious crime. Therefore, deportation sentences should be decided according to the seriousness of the crime committed, such that serious violence, rape, drug crime and murder etc. always automatically trigger a deportation sentence. At the same time, it would be a good idea if you introduce the so-called <U+0094>3 strikes and you're out<U+0094> for less serious crime, since then you have proven to Danish society that you are not interested in being here on the natural basis of obeying the law. Unfortunately, the current government is pulling Denmark in the wrong direction. As one of its first acts, the government chose to stop the border control that was about to be built up. Now the possibility of unimpeded ‚Äì and without significant risk ‚Äì going in and out of Denmark continues. Something that many criminals unfortunately make a living out of. Furthermore, from today the government has watered down the immigration policy, so that it has become far more attractive to come to Denmark. The start-up allowance has been abolished, the cash allowance cap is gone, asylum seekers do not have to live in centres, but in apartments and are offered education. The effect has not been long in coming either. There is a clear increase in the number of asylum seekers. Not since 2001 has the number been as high as in 2012. And 2013 looks set to be higher... Helle Thorning-Schmidt is bringing us back to the immigration pattern of the 90s. It is going to take decades to repair the damage to integration that it causes. I honestly think that the vast majority of Danes find it difficult to find a common thread in the government's almost 2-year-old work. The only one I have been able to find so far is the following: Removed the decision on renewed border control. More asylum seekers and thus the risk that there will be more than Danish society can manage to integrate. This means extra expenses ‚Äì and thus pressure on the state budget. For the time being, the costs for the asylum area and development aid have increased by more than DKK 1.5 billion. DKK per year! We have a government that has done the opposite of what was promised on almost every point. Helle Thorning-Schmidt actually also promised a tough hand in immigration policy. It was one of the places where she should have kept her promise to the people. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it worries the head of government one iota. She seems pretty indifferent to this whole area. As if she hopes that if you don't talk about it, no one will notice the problems. Nor has the government said anything in the case of the Somali rapist. Minister of Justice Morten B√∏dskov (S) is as silent as the grave, although he should and could recommend to the prosecution to thoroughly consider whether an appeal of the Vester Landsret's judgment should not be in order. But here, too, the government seems to think that if you just don't talk about it, no one will notice the problem. On top of that, the government has previously canceled a tightening of the deportation rules, which we implemented together with the then VK government. This is the wrong way to go! The government must come to its senses. Help to get the case appealed. And if the Supreme Court does not judge that the High Court has made a mistake, help the rest of us to tighten the rules.

55158.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly letter <U+0096> Tuesday 31 May 2016 How can the Social Democrats' immigration policy be reconciled with the Alternative's? On Wednesday, the Folketing has the traditional closing debate. We can look back on a year with a new majority after the general election last summer. Much has been achieved. But much still needs to be done. The importance of a new majority is perhaps most clearly seen in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãforeigners and asylum. Whereas the SR government led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Mette Frederiksen and Morten √òstergaard, according to the latter, carried out as many as 45 relaxations of the immigration policy, after the election this summer we have carried out around 30 much-needed tightenings! Last autumn we were surprised by the migration that suddenly took place after the German Chancellor Merkel had bid inside Europe. One can only guess how a continued SR government with Helle Thorning-Schmidt at the helm would have reacted. It had not been good for Denmark. The change this summer instead meant that the situation was used to make the necessary tightening of both asylum rules, family reunification rules, etc. Good and necessary. And a big fight in the soon-to-be-past season has been about border control. As is well known, the DF was until 4 January the only party that wanted border controls reintroduced. But today we have temporary border control. It is well. But we will not stop the fight until it has become permanent and strengthened. But just as we stood alone with the desire for border control, yet succeeded, we now stand alone with the view that refugee policy is about helping people in need for a TEMPORARY period. That refugees and migrants must return to their homeland when the opportunity arises. The Liberals and the Social Democrats decide this week in the Folketing that integration must start even before you have even been granted asylum! That refugees and migrants can be employed in the companies for very low wages, and that they then at the same time earn the right to unemployment benefit from day one. After two years, there is unemployment benefit for the following two years! This is completely wrong. It would be better to make a repatriation plan for each individual. A plan which at the same time means that you give people the skills to return home. After all, many of those who have come to Denmark are resourceful. Naturally, they must return home and help rebuild their country when the opportunity arises. The closing debate on Wednesday will not only be spent looking back on the year that has almost passed. We should also look forward. Show how we solve things. How we ensure a safe Denmark. In my weekly letter last week, I asked Mette Frederiksen to give a clear message as to whether she stood behind her group chairman Henrik Sass Larsen in relation to his thoughts on putting a ceiling on the number of asylum seekers. We still haven't received an answer to that. And if Mette Frederiksen gets the prime ministership she so desperately wants, she should also answer how she will implement a responsible asylum and immigration policy. After all, she wants to gain power over Alternativets, Enhedslisten, SF and the votes of the radicals! Alternative's leader Uffe Elb√¶k stated the other day that Denmark can easily accept 10,000 more asylum seekers. 50,000 will be a challenge, he admits. On Sunday in the program <U+0094>VI see you at Clement<U+0094>, Uffe Elb√¶k made it so clear that he wants all immigration restrictions rolled back. Wild. Relaxation in immigration policy and tens of thousands of new asylum seekers is the policy that the Alternative and the other parties stand for. Mette Frederiksen <U+0096> and Henrik Sass Larsen <U+0096> would like to give the impression that the Social Democrats will pursue a strict and responsible immigration policy. But how should it be done in practice with Uffe Elb√¶k, Morten √òstergaard, Pia Ohlsen Dyhr and Pernille Skipper as the basis? Is the Social Democratic Party willing to cut ties with the four parties on the left wing, who want something completely different than the Social Democratic Party claims they want, on the whole immigration policy? After all, Mette Frederiksen could appropriately answer that question from the floor of the Folketing during the closing debate on Wednesday. If we do not get a clear answer to that question, one can fear that it is because, for the Social Democrats, it is just about getting power. Even if you then have to throw the strict immigration policy overboard.

56303.0,"Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter - Monday 16 September 2013 Chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech At the annual meeting on 14 September 2013 - The spoken word applies <U+0096> Our happy country So it's hard to be in a bad mood on a day like this. When you start the day or a meeting with a song, it eases the mind. And voila, we just got the song!<U+0094>Your country, your choice <U+0096> from here my world goes<U+0094> is even ours very own positive and cheerful song. Now the mood has just been lifted. And then I want to start by talking about the EU. Then we should probably bring the good mood down a bit again - and put the faces in the right, concerned and EU-regulated folders. The EU is just not conducive to the good mood! But we have to get to it. It wasn't many days ago that the story that the EU wants to ban licorice pipes hit the Danish media. What kind of thing? For once, there was something from the EU, which could get even the Danish journalists up in their seats. The story began on Altinget.dk and ran from there at full speed. Editors tweeted pictures of themselves with licorice pipes in the corners of their mouths. And the topic was discussed in the corridors on Christiansborg.TV feature produced. Unfortunately, the country had gotten into a terrible lacquer war mood, before the conservative climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard, who possibly <U+0096> if possible <U+0096> loves the EU even more than our European Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt - rushed on Facebook in a desperate attempt to kill the story: It wasn't real, it didn't fit, it was <U+0094>absolutely wrong<U+0094> and there was a lot going on. The commissioner from the EU actually thought the story should have been quote: <U+0094>killed from the start<U+0094> if the media had used just quote: <U+0094>a little common sense<U+0094>. Look, look, it's interesting. Since when has you could connect the concepts EU and common sense?? And what is the ups and downs in the licorice pipe case? It is possible <U+0096> we actually don't know yet!<U+0096> that the licorice pipe finds mercy in the EU's wry eyes. Many assess however, that the amendment to an EU directive that has been voted through the European Parliament's Committee for the Environment, Food and Public Health <U+0096> yes, they have such a committee in the EU ‚Äì can very well be interpreted as meaning that licorice pipes actually looks like tobacco and therefore gets the dagger thrust of the yellow stars. It is stated that the EU will ban sweets that imitate tobacco, and that this must be done as part of the EU system's fight against all those throughout the EU who smoke and those who might be able to think of smoking - and those who might think of possibly smoking if they were given a chewing gum cigarette by their grandmother for Christmas. Whether the lovely licorice pipe is passed over, we have to find out. But that is, Honestly speaking! There are famines and civil wars, poverty and migrations, cross-border crime and a simmering Euro collapse, and then the EU's Committee for the Environment, Food and Public Health is discussing a ban on sweets that look like tobacco! In both Brussels and Strasbourg there is moreover, parades of lovely chocolate shops that sell chocolate in all shades. Also boxes of chocolate cigars. Such decent cousins ‚Äã‚Äãthat look like cigars from a Tintin movie. I haven't tasted them. They are expensive. But the EU wants prevent us from buying them, because our children will become smokers if we please them with a chocolate cigar. It's simply so crazy that I'm almost at a loss for words. All while this EU committee for public health is sitting around chocolate cigarettes and licorice pipes, a great many Eastern Europeans come into Denmark, who as welfare tourists benefit from the welfare benefits that generation after generation of Danes have established. Other Western European countries have the same challenge. There are simply bigger and more urgent problems both for Denmark and Europe that the EU could throw itself at than chewing gum cigarettes!* The decisions the EU court has made this year alone on the right of foreigners to get a share in well-established Danish benefits <U+0096> education support is an example, most people have heard of <U+0096> is not just a small threat to our welfare society. No <U+0096> it really risks undermining the way we have chosen to organize our welfare society. In my eyes, you can almost only underestimate how harmful it is for the cohesion here at home that so many wage earners from Eastern Europe come to this country. there are more and more Eastern Europeans on Danish construction sites, and that the thousands of new jobs that are created, after all, go to Eastern Europeans and not to unemployed Danes. What is the great thing about building a new motorway and creating employment in Denmark if it is Poles and other Eastern Europeans who run away with work, while unemployed Danish workers must continue to sit back outside the working community? It is socially skewed and at the same time bad for the Danish economy. adapt to the EU. We <U+0096> and in particular our labor market rapporteur - then made a huge effort to convince them that the course was completely wrong. But in vain. The other parties believed that the Danish People's Party wildly exaggerated the threat from Eastern Europe. current government parties, funnily enough especially the Social Democrats and SF, are now very busy pointing fingers at the Danish People's Party and scolding what they believe is our lack of effort to stop what is called social dumping. An expression of wage pressure through imports of foreign labour. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Employment suddenly put on a safety helmet one morning and looked past a construction site. And in a morning newspaper, Helle Thorning-Schmidt came out hard for the Danish People's Party. You have done nothing against social dumping, said the prime minister. I don't know if you can say that the licorice pipe got a different sound when the prime minister read my answer to her in same newspaper, namely that it is herself and her own party that have created and escalated the problems, not the DF. But regardless, what we have heard on the subject since from the Prime Minister is limited. I think you have to say that it was a not-so-well-thought-out offensive that she and the Minister of Employment launched. I think they learned that when you point a finger, three of the others point at you. But my appeal must be: Forget the nice ones sensations. Let's find together the tools that work against social dumping <U+0096> also when it comes to the fight against EU rules. Drop the tactics and solve the problems! Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is <U+0094> a European by nature the heart<U+0094>, she says. The EU means a lot to the Prime Minister, and she is also rounded off by the EU in particular, both politically, educationally and at work. She has found herself in the predicament that her government under the Danish presidency of the EU last year the friends in the EU promised to establish a joint European court for patents. In other words, another EU court that can reprimand the member states. The government has fought tooth and nail to avoid sending the question of Danish accession to the court to a referendum. Most of the parties in the Folketing do not want to ask the Danes about EU issues, because in their opinion the Danish people always vote wrong. Absolutely baroque thinking in a democracy. But in the Danish People's Party we find it difficult to see anything wrong in , that the population will decide through a referendum whether Denmark must cede sovereignty to a new EU Court of Justice. Why is it so difficult? On 25 May next year we will elect members of the European Parliament. This will be preceded by an election campaign in which the parties' candidates will have the opportunity - on TV, radio, newspapers, online, Facebook and wherever else you can get it - to explain their views. So dear Helle Thorning-Schmidt, We know you are of the conviction that Denmark must give up sovereignty here too. Well then, let the Danes decide the matter. So a call from here to call the referendum on the EU patent court to be held on 25 May 2014 at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament! It will be fair and straightforward. Besides that saves money to hold both parts on the same day, I am also convinced that it suits the Danes just fine to be able to hear the parliamentary candidates about the patent case at the same time as the election campaign for the mandates for the European Parliament. I am already looking forward to hearing the leading candidates of the other parties in duels with our good Morten Messerschmidt <U+0096> both about that and much else. a warm welcome to this Annual Meeting in Herning! And you know what? There are almost 900 of us here today. Plus the press. We have never been more. It is the biggest Annual Meeting ever! That is why we also sit a little closer and get to know each other a little more. But that is also what the Danish People's Party is all about. We also have more members of the Danish People's Party than ever before. Over 12,000 are today in our community. There are now more than 12,000 Danes who have actively decided to, that the DF is their party, has taken the step and paid the dues. In a time when other parties are experiencing membership flight, I am immensely happy that more people are choosing the community in the DF. As I said at the beginning: It is therefore difficult not to be a bit happy! And now we have numbers. Some have probably noticed the opinion polls. MetroXpress came out on Wednesday with a poll that gives the DF over 20 percent of the vote and 37 mandates. Incidentally, in that poll, the Social Democratic Party stood at 17.2 percent of the votes and 30 mandates.Berlingske has the service that in the supplement Politiko they have a barometer that, in addition to their own Gallup, brings together six other measuring institutes.On the barometer from here the other day (9. September) the Danish People's Party stands at 17.6 percent in the average of the seven measurements. That's a completely fantastic figure. We got 12.3 percent in the election almost two years ago, and it wasn't even that bad. So yeah .We are allowed to enjoy ourselves here at the weekend. But I also have to say that these are snapshots. Yes, some are laughing, because I've been saying d&eacute for a long time now. And it may well be funny that I say it all the time. But it's also true .I must be the last one to spoil the good atmosphere. But I would still like to remind you that from SF's and S√∏vndal's great rise to the same party and the same chairman's great decline, only two years passed. To remind us exactly d&eacute I have in the inside pocket of my jacket the poll that in 2009 made SF bigger than the Left. continued downhill. Two years is a long time in politics! There are barely two years until the next general election. We are allowed to be happy about the pats on the back that the voters give us at the moment. And we are not SF - we do not sell out the values ‚Äã‚Äãand the heritage silver in favor of ministerial cars! No one is going to hear me embrace the EU, wish the reservations gone or speak for relaxations in the asylum policy to make us suitable for government in the eyes of other parties. History has taught us that politics goes up and down. That is why we must remember every day that we must work hard to maintain the Danes' support for us. Because we know very well that results do not come by themselves. And that the results do not come just because we have a bunch of members of the Norwegian Parliament sitting in the Borgen and whining. with some politics. I am very aware of that. The Danish People's Party is all of us ‚Äì you, you, you and you. All of us! It is our collective effort, the collective impression we leave and the policy we pursue both on a national level, in the regions and in the municipalities, which means that the Danes can identify with us. That's why I want to ask you something today. Perhaps a little unconventional <U+0096> but still. Look at your partner. Both on the one side and on the other side. It is you together who lift the Danish People's Party. Do me a favor, because I can't reach you all from up here. Give your sidekick a pat on the back. He or she deserves it. Guaranteed. It is you, all of us here, who have a share in the Danish People's Party's current situation. Each of us makes an effort, big or small, on a daily basis, on weekends, in the evenings. When we have the time and energy. And it is the sum of the effort that determines the DF's success! We have each other to thank for the fact that we can celebrate the Annual Meeting these lovely September days in Herning, prepare for the Danish People's Party's 18th birthday in a few weeks, in the knowledge that many Danes have sympathy for our attitudes. But. But. But. We all know that we have &eacute to thank the most. We have &eacute who have sacrificed time, effort, safety and precious hours, days, weeks and years, disregarding family dinners, parties and guests <U+0096> all for the Danish People's Party. Where are you Pia? Can you get up? Without you Pia, this would have been quite hopeless. You are in many ways the mother of the party. Thank you Pia, both for making it possible for us to stand here today and because you are still here with us, battle-ready and ready to fight to send our European Prime Minister out of the Prime Minister's Office. As you can clearly sense, then we look forward to many years of effort in the future together with you for the benefit of Denmark.* The other day, the Institute for Happiness Research published, again, a report. It's called <U+0094>There is a happy country<U+0094>. In that sense, I had no doubts. But if I was anyway on a rainy day, reading the report reminded me why there is so great in Denmark. What a society and community, good values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms, we have created together in the last 1000 years.<U+0094>There is something wrong in Denmark<U+0094>, sang blessed John Mogensen back in the 70s. And yes, it was there, and it is there. There is something at the top that needs to be replaced. And we will have to see to it done. But let me dwell on some pictures of Denmark. PART 2: The report says that there is a happy country and maps the reasons for the Danes' happiness. And if we look up the report, we can see that in all the fields where you decide what gives happiness, yes, Denmark tops on all factors. And if we now start from the fact that we live in an increasingly globalized world. We live in a world where we are challenged on all possible fronts and edges, so we also start from in that in a globalized world, there are some things that are easier for many, but there are also some challenges for perhaps most. There are some advantages to globalization for some who, for example, find it easier to travel. They have the language skills and finances to do so, and then there are some who stay back in Denmark, reaching out for opportunities and being burdened by all the problems that globalization creates. But what does the report come to in relation to , what it is that makes Denmark the world's happiest people. Because the report maps the reasons for happiness, it doesn't just write that the Danes are a happy people. One of the things that jumps out at you is that we are a welfare society. That we have a high degree of prosperity. That is why it is important to us in the Danish People's Party that companies have good conditions so that there can be production in Denmark. That we look at how to create jobs and how we maintains jobs so that they do not move out of Denmark. When, for example, we propose to bring forward the initiatives of the growth plan from 2015 to 2014, those that deal with small and medium-sized enterprises, it is exactly to tell the enterprises that we will protect to create good framework conditions so that we can keep the jobs in Denmark. So that we can maintain the welfare society. We also focus on energy costs, which many companies feel is a heavy burden. The rising energy costs as a result of the energy policy that is being pursued .This is where Denmark stands out compared to our neighboring countries. That is why we must also have brought down energy costs for businesses. Another thing that is also important is that we have a society where there is a high degree of trust. So a society where we can trust each other. Where we are no further apart than that we feel a strong cohesion, that we trust each other. Less mistrust. A third factor is that we are safe. This is especially important that people who don't have that much money feel secure in knowing that there is a public welfare system that is ready to help them. That there is a hospital system that is efficient. When you get sick, can you safely count on the fact that you can go to the hospital and be helped. That there is a sector for the elderly that means that when you get older and can no longer fend for yourself, there is a warm system, a helpful system, who come and assist in the hopefully many years that you have left, but where you cannot manage yourself in the same way as you could before. That point, they write in the report, is particularly important. For the people who don't have so much that isn't on the sleeve, it's important, because it reduces uncertainty. They also understand that civil society is important. Civil society provides cohesion. This is where we talk about the voluntary effort. This is where , where we are talking about all the people who go almost every day and do some kind of voluntary effort. It can be in sports associations, where they come three times a week. It can be in the Elderly Affairs. We know most places in the country where we live, that √Ñldresagen, in addition to having many members, they are also incredibly active in relation to, for example, having telephone chains where you call other elderly people in the morning and ask if they are well, if there something has happened during the night. A large volunteer corps that helps each other. We have the night owls as an excellent example of a voluntary effort. They go around in the evening and make sure that our children do not get into trouble and to help them, if there is a need for it. So civil society creates cohesion because the volunteers make a huge effort. That way we get close to each other and create social relations. They also understand that we are a strong democracy. There is a large turnout. There is a feeling of that you influence society. And as a community you can say that it creates these three words, which are repeated when we talk about some of the positive things about Danish society. Some of that which creates happiness, some of that, that makes us a happy people. It is strong community, cohesion and cohesion. I would then say that there are some danger signals. There are some things that we need to be aware of if we also in 10-20 or 30 years must get a report in which the Danes are named one of the happiest people in the world. If we take, for example, our health sector, then if you wake up to a headline like this: <U+0094>Cancer patients are refused new medicine <U+0094> then there are many people who get nervous and ask themselves: <U+0094>What is this about?<U+0094>. It is about whether the regions cannot afford to give it medicine that you, as a cancer patient, need. In other words, the best medicine, the most correct medicine. Or if you compromise to save money. If we get some stories like this one, yes, then you understand that people start to use private health insurance. And that is not what creates cohesion. It is that there is a public health service that is ready to help and that creates security. If we continue, we see a headline like this here: <U+0094>Brain death: Municipalities are cutting vital rehabilitation<U+0094>. If you are brain damaged as a result of a traffic accident, it is crucially important that you get quick help. Quick help is the right help , because that help can in some cases help people out of the problem they have. It creates quality of life. But it is also good financially for Danish society that people become active and active instead of being put back in a situation, because they have been exposed to, for example, a traffic accident. A story like this: <U+0094>Fewer beds make those dying of cancer into throwing balls in hospitals<U+0094>. So the question of some hospitals closing down so many beds, that there are actually groups of patients who are in a pinch because there is no room for them anywhere. They have to be thrown around. If there is something that creates insecurity, then it is d&eacute. I mentioned the elderly area just earlier. And security is of course also about our elderly citizens feeling well. And I have to say that when I see a headline like this: <U+0094>Robots must save welfare<U+0094>, I can understand if there are many elderly people sitting out there thinking: <U+0094>What is this?<U+0094>. If you are told that you can just buy yourself a robot vacuum cleaner, and then we hope that your neighbors have time to give a cup of coffee, then what kind of welfare society are we in the process of creating? So, it may well be that the government has an ambition to save twelve billion kroner on the public sector, and this is the answer. One of those who are behind it is perhaps one of those we should fear the most, in relation to exactly this fight. She sometimes has a way of expressing herself, that seems a bit cold: <U+0094>That's the way it is <U+0094>. Speaking of cohesion, one of the things that I think is incredibly important is the whole school area. Yes, we have previously discussed school reform, but there is also something else in relation to cohesion and school policy. The village community in which I live, where all children basically go to the same primary school. Those who go there must learn to tolerate and accommodate each other. Regardless of whether you come from different backgrounds, everyone basically goes to the same school. They experience each other's good sides and less good sides. It creates coherence. It is clear that when we see that there are more and more other ethnic background, who enter our elementary school, then we have a challenge. I know that up on the board behind me it says <U+0094>bilingual<U+0094>, and some would say, <U +0094>yes, if only it were that good<U+0094>. But the thing here is that if I go from my village school, where everyone basically goes to the same elementary school, and then just go to Vejle, then you would have last year there was a very big discussion about so-called ethnically Danish parents opting out of N√∏rremarkskolen. The school board therefore called out the guard and said that now over 70 percent of the students in the new 0th grade were of other ethnic origins, and what are the consequences? This has the consequence that parents of ethnically Danish children opt out of the N√∏rremark School and send their children to the nearby private school. In other words, we get a bigger division. If we go to Odense. Here is an article from the Fyens Stiftstidende <U+0094> School will make pure immigrant classes<U+0094>. This discussion turned into a question about whether one should create pure immigrant classes in order to be able to keep the children of Danish origin. And if we skip all the way to Copenhagen, and I say all the way to Copenhagen, because we are, after all, in Herning, that was not to offend any Copenhageners, and go to inner N√∏rrebro, there is a tendency for private schools to be frequented to a very large extent. But here it is private schools that again divide the students. So you either have a private school for children of other ethnic origin, or you have a private school for children of Danish origin. What is the point of this? Yes, it is just saying that if we believe that one of the reasons why we are a of the happiest people in the world, is cohesion, well then it is a problem if we have immigration, which means that we get divided schools and thus an ever greater division, so that undermines cohesion. I will also have to get into it with law and order. Because I mentioned security earlier as a crucial part of the fact that we are a happy people. It is connected with crime, and I think that there are many who have experienced coming home to a home that has been ransacked, or know someone who has been the victim of a break-in. It is difficult to imagine something that is much more transgressive. does not like to hear that there has been a strong increase in the number of burglaries since Denmark became a member of Schengen. Since we were not allowed to have border controls, there has been an increase in burglaries of 46 percent and 140 percent in relation to bags - and pickpocketing. That is why we in the Danish People's Party said before the election that we will have to have border controls back. And I can promise you that this is one of the first things we will do, the day we again is in a position to be able to get it through. Crucial for cohesion is also that the people who come here manage to be integrated, so that we can avoid having to deal with the problems in the primary school area and in all sorts of other areas that we are dealing with today. This is what means that there are no special requirements for special catering in institutions, or specific rules for swimming lessons, or that you cannot visit a church at school up to Christmas to see what Danish culture is based on and so on. This means that we must constantly focus on how many people come to Denmark. Because the number is decisive for whether we can integrate the people who actually come .In 2001, when we had a system change, this was a high priority area for the Danish People's Party. What we can see here now, two years after the Social Democrats came to power, is that in 2012 there was a record number of people who had applied for asylum. What we can see from the figures for 2013 is that in 2013 we unfortunately beat the record compared to 2012. So has the Danish People's Party had a significant influence during the time when we sat as a support party for V and K? Yes , of course we have. And now you can see the consequences of the Social Democrats coming to power. We can see that we have started to get the immigration pattern that we also had in the 1990s. It is undermining the cohesion. When, on top of that, we can see that every sixth asylum seeker is in the police's spotlight. That our hospitality is being abused, then it should be an easy matter for politicians to say that it should of course automatically disqualify the person in question from being able to get asylum in Denmark. Cohesion is a question of culture, but it is also an economic question. Asylum expenses are now up to DKK 1.5 billion a year. Last year it was well over a billion. This is money that will be taken out of welfare. can't go to the primary school. They can't go to the hospitals. They can't go to our care for the elderly. That's why there is a close connection between the policy pursued in relation to foreigners and then the close welfare out there in municipalities and regions. I think that is an important point. Denmark is a happy country, but we can also see that there are some places where we have to hold on and fight, so that Denmark can continue to be a happy country.* PART 3: As you can hear that there is enough to be done to secure our lovely country in the future. After all, we have a lovely country. We also saw that when we spent part of the summer sailing around to parts of Denmark with the good ship < U+0094>Halm√∏<U+0094> on a summer cruise under the motto: <U+0094>It sails in the EU <U+0096> we sail for Denmark<U+0094>.<U+0094>Halm√∏<U+0094 > is a schooner, built in 1900 and beautifully restored. I could talk for hours about our travel memories from this summer aboard this glorious sailing ship. But I will limit myself to highlighting three things here.<U+0094>Halm√∏<U+ 0094> has been on the seas, straits and belts in Denmark for 113 years. It has survived wars and crises, good weather and storms, and it has survived a technological development that several decades ago overtook sails and wooden steering wheels on ships. And it stands steady <U+0094>Halm√∏<U+0094> still, I can personally assure you of that. I steered the ship myself out of the Limfjord after my stay in Aalborg, and rarely have I rediscovered my inner playboy like in those hours! The skipper even took a nap on deck, so I also felt a certain pride in leading this old, proud ship and obviously enjoying the confidence of the captain himself that he dared to leave me alone at the wheel and helm. We know it well. old truth: <U+0094>One is a chart to understand, another ship to steer <U+0094> During the Occupation, Halm√∏ contributed to saving Danish Jews to Sweden after October 1943, when the Nazis' hunt for Jewish citizens began.We discussed several times during the trip the ship's role in these historical events. And I can promise you to sit there - right on board the very same ship that had played an active role - and talk about how brave citizens helped other citizens in security, d&eacutet can make the hairs stand up on the arms. Human destinies, daring and history become very present. This year, in two weeks' time actually, it is the 70th anniversary of the Nazi occupation forces' action against the Danish Jews, on 1 .-2. October 1943. Thus it is also the 70th anniversary of the rescue operations of good Danes, who helped many Jewish citizens to safety in Sweden. And made the Nazi operation an overall failure. Brave citizens chose to help their fellow citizens against an occupying power. One must not rout with the word <U+0094>proud<U+0094> and use it interchangeably about everything. But here we have something to be proud of! I think that on the occasion of the 70th anniversary, we should be happy about the Danes, who actively contributed to the survival of the Jewish families back then in October 1943. Thank you for your efforts!* The second thing I want to mention from the summer tour is the overflowing reception we experienced wherever we arrived. Cheerful and active, local DFers met in the harbors and created a cozy setting in which citizens from the city and the surrounding area could enjoy themselves when <U+0094>Halm√∏<U+0094> docked. And what interest! We shook lots of hands and heard about big and small problems and wishes from Danes who had found their way to the quay and happily told us about what was on their minds. Just as the trip was meant to be. It was overwhelming! All of us who were there are more enriched day than before we set sail with Kronborg in Helsing√∏r in the background on a sunny Wednesday in August. We have a clearer picture of what preoccupies the Danes, also up close, in our daily life, in our municipalities. I could recommend the government to listen a little to the Danes. The Danes, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, are the very ordinary people that you can meet by, for example, sailing from port to port, taking a walk on the streets of a provincial town or meeting over a cold beer or a cup of coffee, almost wherever you want. But you have to want it. Listen to the people, that is, Madam Prime Minister. It is not done just by putting a safety helmet on your head, creating a so-called photo-opportunity for a bunch of press photographers, placing a point of view in a newspaper - and then hastily rushing to a lunch meeting with Barack Obama and trying to start a war that few Danes want! D&eacutet I will return to in a moment. For the third thing I have chosen mention from our summer trip, is that the Danes are both happy, as I touched on earlier in the speech, but also really worried. The Danes are worried about the care in the immediate area, the welfare of their municipality. I have no count of how many reports <U+0096> both personal, very private accounts and some more political and principled <U+0096> I heard while we were around the country in August. Accounts of municipal neglect, horrible priorities in relation to the elderly, lack of rehabilitation for the brain-damaged , laxity in the schools The list is long. It tells me that the government is in the process of breaking down the necessary trust between citizens and authorities, which must be in a welfare society, where equality and solidarity are high and the willingness to pay a fairly high tax is intact.

57288.0," In short, these are real rubbish cases, because they divert attention from what is essential: How we get Denmark out of the economic crisis and secure our future. But while the aftermath of the Penkowa case can probably best be dealt with in a feature film or soap opera, the case of Denmark's possible breach of a UN convention from 1961 is far worse. Not least because the focus is almost exclusively on the minister and less on the substance. I will not comment on Birthe R√∏nn Hornbech's handling in detail, but her actions have seemed strange <U+0096> and thus strengthened the suspicion that not everything has gone right. For example, I do not understand how you can turn the argument 180 degrees, as the minister has done. In this connection, the media have offered the Danes two things: On the one hand, the drama surrounding the minister and the left wing's demand to have all cards laid on the table. On the other hand, a long series of interviews with well-functioning, fully integrated Palestinians, with whom one cannot help but have sympathy. But is that the whole story? Is this about persecuted innocents with a claim to Danish citizenship because a convention requires it? Or is it about parties in the Folketing that blow up a storm against a minister? It is not that simple at all. When the Social Democrats, the People's Socialists, the radicals and Enhedslisten want Birthe R√∏nn Hornebech to stand trial, it is due to a natural desire to discredit the government as much as possible with an election within reach. When the Danish People's Party takes a wait-and-see attitude, the reason is that it wants clarity on what Denmark has basically committed itself to. We demand an answer to whether the Convention on the Rights of Stateless Persons automatically cancels the Danish Parliament's constitutional right to grant citizenship. And then we want, as something quite obvious, an answer to whether the convention also dictates citizenships granted to criminal stateless aliens. Thanks to a demand from the Danish People's Party, in 2005 we were able to carry out an investigation of the 321 Palestinians who in 1992 were granted residence permits on the basis of a special law, after they had kept Bl√•g√•rds Kirke in N√∏rrebro occupied. It turned out that 74 percent of the group lived on transfer income, and that 42 percent had committed a crime or had been fined more than 1,500 kroner. Does a convention really oblige us to give these people Danish citizenship? While TV is busy portraying the Palestinians as a well-functioning and unfairly treated group, reality shows far more nuances. But precisely with the media's treatment in mind, it does not seem surprising that a newly formed <U+0094>citizens' association<U+0094> under the leadership of SF European Parliament candidate Fathi El-Abed is now working to give the rejected stateless persons compensation for tort. The paragraph to be applied was also used by the residents who were evicted from the Thule base in 1953. The shamelessness knows no bounds. In Thule, people who had lived on the site for generations were displaced and lost access to valuable hunting and fishing areas. The stateless Palestinians, on the other hand, have had exactly the same access to support themselves and stay in Denmark as Danish citizens. What does the financial loss consist of? The left wing demands an impartial commission to investigate the denials to the stateless Palestinians. But if an impartial commission is to investigate anything in this case, it should rather be Denmark's participation in UN conventions and their interpretation. May I also remind you that several stateless Palestinians <U+0096> have been granted citizenship on several occasions. The last time was on 16 December 2010, when 35 Palestinians were granted citizenship by the Danish Parliament. 16 of these did not meet the character requirement <U+0096> which means, among other things, that they had committed a crime <U+0096> 18 did not meet the language requirement, 11 did not meet the requirement to be free from public debt and five could not support themselves , just as 15 did not meet the requirement for an indefinite residence permit. Has anyone demanded an investigation into how this could be done? In short: does an outdated convention from 1961 dictate us to grant citizenships to people who do not meet the requirements of the legislation decided by a majority in the Folketing? That is the real <U+0096> and unfortunately overlooked ‚Äì question in this case.

55665.0," ""You should never let a good crisis go to waste"", reads a famous quote. They have learned that lesson in Brussels, where the EU Commission is using the corona crisis to shift the balance between the member states and the EU in the usual way. More EU, less nation state. So the budget must have a proper increase. With a possible extra bill for the Danes of DKK 6.7 billion. DKK per year! Or the equivalent of increasing the basic amount of the pension for all pensioners by DKK 12,000 each year. At least I know what I would choose. And there will be no more money for the EU budget. At the same time, the EU Commission proposes that the EU borrow DKK 5,600 billion on our behalf. DKK, which will then primarily be given to the countries in Southern Europe. Even to an Italy, where the tax is lower than in Denmark, and where they are now seriously discussing whether the money should go to lowering the tax further. Mette Frederiksen has previously called the commission's proposal ""complete nonsense"". But at the same time, she has recently softened and was ready to meet the EU Commission. On the contrary, I would encourage her to stand firm. If something is ""completely wrong"", it is probably a very good idea to speak up. In fact, she herself said it very precisely in the parliament the other day, when we discussed the plans to increase the EU's budget. ‚ÄúWhere is that money going to come from? Should it be higher taxes? Or should it be taken from climate action and education? I don't have that money‚Äù, she said. Totally agree. But then the Danish government must also clearly say no to the drastic increase in the EU's budget! But Mette Frederiksen doesn't want that. And then it ends up with some poor compromise between the countries, where we can be sure of one thing: to be left with the bill. And the billions for the EU must be found somewhere in the Danish economy. On welfare or via higher taxes. And then it is Mette Frederiksen herself who is going to have to answer the uncomfortable questions she otherwise so rhetorically asked others in the parliamentary hall the other day. And in relation to the completely abnormal debt acquisition that the EU is proposing - 5,600 billion. DKK, we must remember: That regardless of whether a larger share of these many billions is given as a loan, the money will never come back. Be honest about it. We're going to be on the hook for the bill. Therefore, it is clearly time to speak up, so that the Danes do not have to work even longer before retirement age - and pay even higher taxes - so that the opposite can happen in Southern Europe. The EU is moving in the wrong direction. All the time more EU and less self-determination for the populations of the nation states. It sucks the oxygen out of our democracy and empties the national state of its content. And the course towards an ""ever narrower union"" will only be strengthened when the British leave the EU at the end of the year and the Franco-German axis with the super-Europeans Macron and Merkel at the helm becomes even more dominant. The Danish People's Party was founded in 1995 in particular to fight for: 1) A strict immigration policy. We will decide ourselves who comes to Denmark. 2) Opposition to the EU. We must secure Denmark as an independent country. 3). Proper welfare - especially to ensure dignified conditions for our elderly. We stand firm on these things. We are also fighting for them here 25 years later. And regardless of how other politicians ‚Äì parties ‚Äì behave; run our way when our positions are popular and the other way when the wind turns we stand firm. Our political goals are not governed by whether the mood is for or against the EU - for or against a strict immigration policy - for or against proper welfare - also for the elderly. We are guided by what we are convinced can ensure a good Denmark for future generations. Not guided by securing for ourselves and the party a certain popularity. Conversely, I have no doubt that there are many Danes who want the same as us. So it's just a matter of holding on. Huge fight. For our political goals. And right now it's about giving the EU tougher resistance. Especially in relation to the huge bill that the EU plans to hand over to Denmark these weeks. Otherwise, it will cost welfare.

54291.0," Thus she set in motion many of the people who naturally see a dream in coming to Europe <U+0096> especially Northern Europe. Both people with a refugee background, but also migrants seeking better material conditions. In Denmark, we quickly felt the consequences. Chaos arose in R√∏dby and at the Danish-German border, where a migration of people in periods forced the authorities to close the motorways to cars. No one seemed to know what was going to happen! In just over a week, at least 5,000 people have now come to Denmark. Of course, without anyone knowing the exact number, or knowing where they actually come from. Many have used Denmark as a transit country to get on to Sweden, Norway and Finland, while just over 800 have so far applied for asylum in Denmark. It is clear that there is no control. That you don't know who is coming to the country. This has been the case to an increasing extent since 2001, when Denmark joined the Schengen cooperation and removed border controls. The prerequisite for this was that there was control at the <U+0094>outer borders<U+0094>. Chancellor Merkel's sudden decision to grant free access to Germany effectively made this condition no longer present. The basis for Denmark's accession to Schengen was gone. This also means that, in light of the tragic refugee situation in the world, you can now get people to Europe who want to live our values. Whether the terrorist organization IS, which has destroyed large parts of Syria and Iraq, sends potential terrorists to Europe, where they can stay hidden in the crowd, is not known for sure. But the risk is exceedingly great. Yesterday even Germany had enough and re-established control at the border with Austria. Austria itself has deployed the army to patrol the border with Hungary. And in Hungary it has been declared that anyone who crosses the border into Hungary illegally after September 15 will be arrested. Here one can probably talk about being <U+0094>overtaken by reality<U+0094>. At least for Germany. What kind of wobbly course is that? One day you open the borders without looking at the consequences. For the next to discover these consequences and then to demand thorough control. One moment it is pretended that there is room for everyone in Europe <U+0096> both real refugees and migrants <U+0096> only to have to recognize the reality the next day. It is quite possible that Germany's re-establishment of control at the border with Austria will be interpreted as a wave of a wagon pole to the ministers of the EU countries, who are holding a crisis meeting in Brussels today. Here they must negotiate, among other things, the distribution of 160,000 who are already in Europe. But the attempt to pretend that simply by distributing the 160,000, then we have solved the challenge, is unfortunately misleading. Once you know that the road to Europe is open, many more will naturally try. Then the 160,000 are many more <U+0096> no one knows how many. But why shouldn't people living in poor conditions in Africa and the Middle East make the attempt? Once again, the European countries will be overtaken by reality. Last week I stated in this place that the Schengen cooperation has broken down and that we should therefore take the necessary precautions and introduce sufficient controls at our borders. Nothing has changed about that. And with the reintroduction of control by the other countries, the opponents (which unfortunately include all parties other than DF!) have lost the legal argument that we must not introduce it because of the Schengen rules. Because why can the others then within the Schengen rules? Is it just because Germany is big and mighty and does what suits them? Is it Chancellor Merkel who in reality decides whether we in Denmark must have controls at our borders? The Schengen cooperation was at best a beautiful dream for some. But it was and is only a dream. Reality shows that open borders are the recipe for chaotic conditions, where you have no control over who stays in your country. Therefore, I hope that the countries now realize that the handling of the huge challenges that exist must be done in a fundamentally different way: 1. That we must have control over who comes to. 2. That refugees must be helped and have protection temporarily until they can return to the immediate area or home country. 3. That we must provide much greater and better help to the many refugees who are in the surrounding areas. In this way we can help many more people in need <U+0096> and at the same time without undermining the society that generations before us have built and made into one of the world's best countries to live in. I have no hopes that today's meeting provides the shadow of this solution. But perhaps it still dawns on more and more people that this is the way forward. Initially, it would be nice if the government not only followed in Chancellor Merkel's footsteps, but also dared to mark a clear Danish voice on how we see things solved. Otherwise, more people will ask the question: <U+0094>Do we govern ourselves or are we governed by Chancellor Merkel?<U+0094> ",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes government handling without irrationally claiming state favoritism towards any group.

55286.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter ‚Äì Monday 13 October 2014 We must pull in the right direction On Friday, the book <U+0094>Class battle from above <U+0096> The Danish social model under pressure<U+0094> will be published. Here, five authors describe how the welfare society, which many Danes both love and support, is under pressure. Berlingske described parts of the content over the weekend, and it seems like a very interesting discussion that the five authors take up. Because in some respects, it seems quite true that our society is heading in the wrong direction. That we are heading towards an increasingly divided and divided Denmark to the detriment of cohesion and our welfare state. Among other things, it is very important that we ensure that there are equal opportunities for, for example, taking an education, getting treatment for any illness and so on. It is also important that the Danes as a whole feel safe and therefore look forward to tomorrow instead of fearing it. And precisely the five authors point out that insecurity has increased especially among those who are defined in the book as the working class. This applies in particular to those who are outside the labor market. In the book, globalization is also treated as a phenomenon that provides opportunities for some, while others see it as a threat. Those who then get the opportunity, the so-called elite, have long closed their eyes to the fact that globalization has major consequences for many Danes. We saw a good example of such thinking at De Radikale in 2012 in connection with negotiations on a new energy agreement, which would particularly hit companies such as the cement factory Aalborg Portland hard. 340 were at risk of losing their jobs. Then De Radikale's energy spokesman, Rasmus Helveg Petersen, said the following: <U+0094> Aalborg Portland has had a very high vote share, but is uninteresting in this context. It is about the workplaces of the future, and it is not Aalborg Portland that under any circumstances must fill that role<U+0094>. Another example is the massive political support from other parties for the free movement of labour, which perhaps gives advantages to some Danes, but which at the same time means that tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans have come to Denmark to work. This happens at the same time as Danes become unemployed. These Danes must therefore compete with Eastern Europeans for the available jobs. A study carried out by Avisen.dk last year showed that among Danes with a vocational education ‚Äì such as tradesmen, drivers or hairdressers ‚Äì 73 percent feel threatened by foreign labour. The concern is somewhat less among the highly educated, where 36 percent consider eastern workers a threat. These are just not concerns that a majority in the Danish Parliament takes seriously. That is what we do in the Danish People's Party. We also know that insecurity is far greater in the so-called ghettos than in other urban areas. A study last year, which the Center for Boligsocial Udvikling was behind, showed that more than one in four people who live in the 33 residential areas that are on the government's list of particularly vulnerable of this kind, feel unsafe walking out in their immediate area after dark breakthrough. We also know that it is precisely in these areas that there are problems with stone throwing at the police, firefighters and others who are just trying to look after the citizens. It is quite serious for the people living in these areas. Yet it often seems that the problems are tried to be trivialized when someone tries to bring them up. In the Danish People's Party, we want immediate consequences and zero tolerance towards young criminals. It must help put an end to their ravages in residential areas. Because we want everyone, regardless of where they live, to be safe in their neighbourhood. And that's how it should be all the way around. It must not happen that a large part of the Danes are left off the hook and have to watch passively while the so-called development rumbles on. It must not be the case that Danish politicians simply shrug their shoulders in relation to the challenges that globalization indisputably presents, and say the famous words: <U+0094>That's the way it is<U+0094>.

55430.0," Another People's Meeting is over. Beautiful Allinge as a fantastic setting for the Folkem√∏det. Not least when Bornholm shows itself from its most beautiful side with high sunshine. Folkem√∏det has gained a reputation in some places for being a party especially for politicians, organizational people and lobbyists. There is something right about that, but I have now also had the pleasure of talking to many different Danes. So ""the people"" are certainly also part of the Folkem√∏det. Would like more of that! Politics naturally take up a lot of space at the Folkem√∏det. This is also the case this year, when, among other things, it created quite a bit of attention that I, together with the Social Democratic chairwoman Mette Frederiksen, focused on the problems that free movement in the EU creates for Denmark. I think that the vast majority agree that it is basically good and sensible that we can trade freely across national borders in the EU. Also that there is the possibility that you can look for work in countries where there is a shortage of labour. But in usual EU style, the interpretation of EU rules has run completely wild. We have come far too far from the sensible idea of ‚Äã‚Äãensuring free trade between EU countries. Today, free movement rules also allow Roma to travel around Europe to beg and collect bottles. That they can settle in camps, as we have seen in Copenhagen, for example. Here, Roma live in inhumane conditions and create insecurity and unrest around them. For me, it has very little to do with free trade and reasonable opportunities to work and study in another country. At the same time, migrant workers from Eastern Europe in particular undermine Danish wage earners. In far too many cases, they contribute to wage suppression, poorer working conditions and social dumping. Unemployed Danes are kept out of the labor market when it is cheaper to employ an Eastern European who is willing to ‚Äì or is tricked into ‚Äì working under worse working conditions than those we normally know in the Danish labor market. And when at the same time you find that Eastern Europeans can send, for example, a Danish child check home to children in Romania or Bulgaria who have never set foot in Denmark, then it is completely crazy. And it is also with reference to the rules for migrant workers that Denmark's right to decide for itself who has the right to stay in this country has been denied by the EU Court of Justice. Among other things with the so-called Metock judgment, which made it easier to get family reunification in Denmark, if you have only been resident in the EU for a period. Absolutely foolish. So, in my view, there can be no doubt that the interpretation of the EU's rules on free movement and migrant workers has gone far too far from reason. Therefore, we are now calling on Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen to call for political negotiations on how Denmark can offensively approach the challenge. We simply need the rules rolled back to their original purpose. And Denmark should take the lead in this work. During the election campaign in 2015, DF and the three parties that are in government today agreed on the EU political agreement ""Danish welfare in Europe"", where, among other things, we gave each other a handshake that we should work to ensure that Danish welfare benefits remain in Denmark and ensure that the EU does not become a social union. It was a really good agreement seen from DF's eyes. But since then too little has happened. It is too slow to implement the good intentions. I am therefore pleased that the Social Democrats have now also committed themselves to concrete action in this area. We will hold them up to that. Just as we will hold the government up to our joint agreement from 2015. Here at last. It's not all about politics... These days I'm cycling around Denmark with other good people to collect money for BROEN, which is an organization that works to ensure that vulnerable children have the opportunity to have an active free time in line with others children.

53605.0," And when a politician fills up, there are often big birthday interviews. Likewise with the Social Democratic group chairman. At the weekend it was therefore announced that the Social Democrats will now set a ceiling on how many asylum seekers Denmark must accept, and that such a number was <U+0094>closer to 1,000 than 10,000 a year<U+0094>. It was a fantastic message. A new line from a party that, less than a year ago, was at the head of a government which, according to the then government partner, the radical chairman, Morten √òstergaard, implemented 45 relaxations in the field of immigration. With the change of majority last summer, we have succeeded in having a large number of strictures made again, so that we have come closer to a sensible and reasonable immigration policy. Not that we have finished adjusting the immigration policy yet, not at all, but legislatively it has gone the right way! Sass Larsen's message yesterday got Enhedslisten into the red zone. Immigration rapporteur Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen demanded party chairman Mette Frederiksen on the field to determine whether the asylum cap was the Social Democrats' new political line, or whether it was just another solo announcement from the group chairman. DR's Radioavisen was then able to announce yesterday afternoon that it had not been possible to get a comment from Mette Frederiksen, and repeated inquiries to the Social Democracy had only yielded the &eacute answer: The party has no further comments. comments on a ground-breaking proposal from the party's own group chairman. Even in an area that is absolutely crucial for the further development of our entire society. In January, a Gallup poll showed that refugee and immigrant policy is by far the most important issue for Danes ‚Äì far ahead of health and employment policy and other important issues. Half believed that immigration constitutes <U+0094>a serious threat to our national identity<U+0094>. Therefore, one might think that a proposal from the party's group chairman would be followed up by explanations of what was actually meant and how the policy would be implemented. But the Social Democrats had no further comments I'm afraid there is a very good reason why there were no further comments! Namely, that group chairman Sass Larsen is simply being used to make significant announcements about the immigration issue. But significant announcements that the Social Democrats do not intend to proceed with. Striking messages that have the sole purpose of winning over voters who believe in them for a short while. But the Danes have a right to know what they will really get if the Social Democrats are once again at the head of a government. Is it an immigration policy √†la De Radikale, which together with Alternativet, SF and Enhedslisten are the foundation? With lots of easing as a result <U+0096> exactly as we saw it last in the period 2011-2015? Or is it Henrik Sass Larsen's significant announcements at the weekend and earlier at the turn of the year that will be the direction? Many Danes are tired of <U+0094>signals<U+0094>. They want politics that work! Results! Therefore, it is absolutely crucial whether you actually want to pursue the policy you claim to stand for, or whether it is all just tactics. Mette Frederiksen could appropriately be allowed to answer that. In Denmark, we can manage the development ourselves. If we want. For example, we can ensure permanent border control, which at the same time immediately processes those who want to seek asylum in Denmark. If these people come from Germany <U+0096> a safe country <U+0096> we can reject them for asylum treatment d&eacuter. The Danish People's Party is ready for such measures. Is the Social Democracy? Anyway, I would like to wish my parliamentary colleague Henrik Sass Larsen a happy birthday. But at the same time, I must ask his chairman, Mette Frederiksen, to explain himself!

56568.0,"We cannot shape Denmark's future on an alliance about everything you don't want. What we need is for the parties that want Denmark to get together and shape the future. The spoken word applies. Fantastic pictures from the first day of school this year .You get in a good mood when you see all these hopeful children who are on their way into a world that lies open at their feet. We can all remember the first day of school. If not our own, then at least our children's. That just gives you hope. And it's actually kind of the first day of school in Denmark again. Those who left 9th grade this summer, they almost only went to school at a time when there was a crisis in Denmark. But now we are in a different place. Now there is reason for optimism. We have not been better off for 10 years. And everyone expects that already next year, the Danish economy will be back at full strength. Work, to them there can. It's going really, really well. And then you'd think that the politicians rolled up their sleeves. Because now it's about reaching out for the future. Now it's about finding the ambitions. The belief that now we have to make progress to the joy and benefit of the many. Can you feel it? So can you feel that it's bubbling?! No? Actually neither do I. Because when you walk into Christiansborg on a daily basis and find that things are actually going better than in the last 10 years, someone needs to explain to me how it is that we have a government which, for the third year in a row, has presented a finance law with massive savings on everything called education in Denmark. And if we are better off than we have been for 10 years, how is it that you cannot present a tax reform with otherwise sensible ideas about lower taxes on work, without the money having to be collected from them in the Danish society, which already had the very least - with a cash assistance ceiling and an integration benefit. And how can it be that there was no money to exempt the electric cars from tax, but every single year since then, hundreds of millions have been found to ease the registration tax in general .And when we are better off now than we have been in the last 10 years, how can it be that people don't think we can afford or have the opportunity to take so much as a single quota refugee this year and next years. It's too small! It's not the politics of necessity, we've put that behind us. It's political choices you make. It's bad choices that are the reason why Denmark must have a new government and that the Radical Left must set the course for it.*** Then I thought about what is happening at Christiansborg, since we do not reach out for the opportunities. Since we do not seize the chance to take our destiny into our own hands. We do not have the ambitions present. And now you have to be careful with remote diagnoses, but I still think that there is such a social disease that has especially gripped the major parties that support the prime minister. It is what is called the 'Stockholm syndrome'. I don't know if you are familiar with it. that, but that's where you fall in love with your hostage-taker. Up in Herning, the Danish People's Party is having its annual meeting. Kristian Thulesen Dahl gave a speech this morning, and that's the way all the prayer rugs in Danish politics are turning. now. After all, it is with the value-political burka pulled so far over the head that nothing from reality gets in. Not a glimmer of hope or light in relation to the future comes through. And so I just say, to the good people in the Left, to our friends in the Social Democrats and perhaps especially to Mette Frederiksen; we should not deposit the keys to Denmark's future with the Danish People's Party. We can do much better if we do it together! *** We cannot shape Denmark's future solely on an alliance about everything you don't want. Everything you want to prevent must happen. What we need is for the parties who want Denmark to get together and shape the future. And now I have to tell you how. Because I did it in the spring, that I went around a large number of educational institutions, spoke to over 1000 young people from vocational training, high schools and HF. And then I said to them all; Now is the time for you to make demands on your politicians. Because otherwise you will wake up one day like the young British did. For a Brexit you will have to live with the consequences because the older generations, out of fear for your future, had made a decision over your head. Which, if you had bothered to ask yourselves, would have been a different one, because the young Brits wanted to stay in the EU. That's not how it should be in Denmark. The youth must have a voice. So I asked them: what are the biggest problems? What are the biggest challenges that you dream that your generations can say, ""we solved them."" And the ambitions were lined up. It was climate change that we must face. It is the global inequality that we must tackle. It is more peace, less terror and more integration and room for diversity where we live. It is an education system where you are not pushed forward and sick of being, but where you learn together with your peers and gain faith in your own possibilities. These are the ambitions that the youth have. And there I ask myself, isn't that exactly right what politics is about? How we can turn their ambitions for the society of the future into today's politics, so that we set the course there. This is exactly what we mean when we say ""make Denmark bigger"". It is not about move the border to the south or something else territorial. No. When we talk about making Denmark bigger, it is about moving the boundaries of what is humanly possible as a community in community. When we say, make Denmark bigger, we mean we opportunities. Opportunities for those who have had a difficult start in life and who need to be taken care of. Who need more pedagogues in the day care institutions, so that they too get on the right track. And opportunities for those who have just arrived here and who dream of becoming contributing citizens of society in their new nation, new homeland, but who today are prevented from doing so too much because we do not start the integration from day one. And we are talking about opportunities and thinking about opportunities for those who, during their life in education or working life, have gone down with the flag in stress, as part of the paradox that although we are better off than previous generations have had it, there are still more , who go down with the flag of stress. And they too must have created the opportunities to return and have a life worth living. And when we talk about making Denmark bigger, we think globally. Because we believe not that Denmark is a small, delicate flower that we have to protect from the outside world. On the contrary, we have shown ourselves to be an extremely viable plant, which hopefully could set off shoots in many other places. It is not in Denmark that 25 percent of the young people are unemployed, as is the case in Southern Europe. It is not in Denmark, where there is 10 percent unemployment in the wake of the crisis, as we see in France. But in all those places, they look at Denmark and wish they had a welfare society that more closely resembled ours. And Macron has thrown himself into making flexicurity reforms in France to get one step closer. So we can influence the world. We win when we cooperate with other countries. But it requires yes, that the ambitions are about joining the debate. And not like the prime minister, who travels around to get a greasy special scheme in relation to child benefit - instead of influencing the entire development in Europe, in the direction of more welfare societies. Then crises , like those we have been through, must not again lead to poverty - also in countries that are very close to us. When we talk about making Denmark bigger, we are talking about taking responsibility for the future. When we say to people, as we live longer: if you want to share some of those working years with your colleagues at work - some of the good years of life that come extra - then we have the opportunity to give your children a better upbringing, than they have today. Then we have the opportunity to invest in education, so that we are better equipped to seize the opportunities that the future offers. And then we can do better for those who have it most difficult in Danish society. And in concrete terms, we are now proposing the Folkeskolens Fremtidsfond with one billion over the next 10 years to develop the school. Because that is what we want. A folk school that thrives for all students. We know that there are some of the decisions that have been made over recent years that have meant that we may not yet be where we want to be. With a varied school day. A school day full of movement. With a school day where we bring in the new technology and uses it to prepare the children for the future, which is characterized by technology. We are not there yet. There are no resources for that. The development is not going well enough. And therefore, of course, we must do it, just like Ole Vig did it with the seven-point program in its time, which helped to set a huge school development in motion, because people were not afraid to say that the primary school must also develop as a mirror of the times we live in. But that requires that there is political will to lend a hand. And when we say ""make Denmark bigger"", we mean green. Yesterday we got the news that the government has given up presenting a proposal for a new energy agreement .We understand from the energy minister and the climate minister that he is busy. With what, nobody knows. But apparently it is not the green transition. But we have ambitions. We are the world's green miracle nation. People make pilgrimages here to find out how one can at the same time reduce one's CO2 emissions and create progress, momentum for everyone in society. That one is not at the expense of the other, which the American voters had their ears full of. But then, Jesus didn't stop with making miracles because he had once walked on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGalilee. And that is why we have to make new, green miracles. We may not have drawn the luckiest lot in the lottery when the North Sea was measured and distributed with the oil resources. But it actually says so to the fact that the part of the North Sea we have is an inexhaustible store of energy. Not in the underground, but at the surface. Because that is where the water is lowest and the wind is strongest and blows the most, and therefore we have the opportunity, if we are massively betting on offshore wind as the energy resource of the future, that instead of our fellow citizens in other European countries sending billions of euros to the despots in the east or to the sheiks in the south, they could conveniently get their green power from the wind sheiks in Denmark. It starts now. It starts now. And if he doesn't have time for anything else, the good climate minister, he could at least start the necessary mapping of the North Sea, so that we can bid in and deliver the green power - not just to us ourselves, but also to the rest of Europe, as our society becomes more and more electrified, and we will make good use of all the power we can produce in a sustainable manner. But, when we talk about making Denmark bigger, we are talking i.e. about seeing opportunities. We talk about thinking globally. We talk about taking responsibility for the future. And we talk about thinking green. But we also talk, we think a little, on deaf ears. that although the possibilities are there to reach out to the future, it is very far from the reality and discussion we have at Christiansborg, where people are in full swing of turning economic surplus into human deficit.*** It is two years since there have been elections. Try to think back to that time. What was it that Angela Merkel said. She said: ""Wir schaffen das"". And then I have to promise that they all lined up to throw dirt on her. Because there was one political leader who dared to say that we could handle that, that the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II, it is a shared responsibility. We have been told again and again that it is going completely wrong. We cannot, at all, manage it in Denmark. But are we worse off in Denmark today than we were two years ago? Not when we look at the economy minister's publications. Then all the arrows point upwards. And the reality is also that because voluntary Denmark rolled up its sleeves and opened its arms and welcomed them, and because people worked hard in the municipalities, both those who were used to to receive refugees, and now many more, and those who had not received refugees for many years. Yes, it was even the case in Copenhagen that Anna Mee had to tell the companies that approached to help refugees that so there weren't many refugees either, but we have some other citizens who you can help. And therefore the reality is that today in Denmark there is no one who is worse off because of the refugee crisis. The only ones who are worse off in Denmark today, it is they who the government and the Danish People's Party have purposefully said should be worse off - because they had hit the poorest families on cash assistance and on integration benefits in Denmark on the wallet. It is not the refugees' fault. It is the government's fault. One is tempted to say; ""Wir haben es geschaft"", although it will probably bother me for many years that I said that. But in any case, the point is that they also said that you cannot win elections if you want to responsibility for humanitarian disasters. And now we'll have to see how it goes on Sunday in Germany. I'm not going to jump into election forecasts, but even with an untrained eye, it doesn't look like it's going that bad even for the only European leader who had enough courage to say that we can handle it. And then there are probably some out there who say, yes, it's good with the radical spelt general and his army of naive humanists. Then they sit there again and patting each other on the back that it all has to happen with the snap of a finger. But we can just turn on the television and then we can see that nothing is under control at all. That the refugees are spilling over the Mediterranean. That Italy is about to succumb. And you know what? Those people are right. We in Europe today are not a notch better off in relation to the next refugee crisis than we were for the last one. And that is why, that we are fighting for a world where fewer people have to flee to live. And yes, the number matters. If we are able to avoid people who have no chance of getting residence in Europe because they are migrants and not fleeing from war, not risking their lives across the Mediterranean. Yes, we have come a long way and saved some human lives. Because their lives are not in Europe. They will be sent back when their case is been processed. Then there is no reason for them to risk their lives in the attempt. And if we could now jointly figure out how to process the asylum cases, so that it was not up to each individual country individually. This is how we saw did not wait for the refugees to stand at our border, but managed it in the community we have at Europe's outer border with orderly conditions. Far better than Europe are the refugees who are sitting in Greece and Italy today. Because we did it in community. Then we could take back control. And that only requires one thing. And that is the will to solve the integration task in solidarity. had such a scheme in 2015, fewer refugees would have come to Denmark. Not more. And that is why we would have been in a better position to help the many quota refugees who need it. Whether it is in the neighboring areas of Syria or now in Bangladesh. But instead of joining the fight to get a handle on it - and could say to all those who, like me, are worried about what is happening in the Mediterranean - that now we take action, then they will station soldiers at the German border. Well, it is German refugees, we are afraid why? Instead of standing guard against Germany, you should stand together with Germany and say to the Eastern European countries that if you still want money from the structural funds, then you must also be there when there are humanitarian disasters that require a shared responsibility. And if it is about avoiding the human catastrophe in the Mediterranean and ensuring that things are back under control at Europe's external borders, then all the resources used at the border, whether police or soldiers, or whatever - they are better used at Frontex, Europe's border agency, which begs and asks that the countries will help, so that they can do their work at Europe's outer borders. But Denmark has not signed up there either to a sufficient extent, because we would rather spend the resources on ourselves and on symbolic politics. I think it is so important that no one succeeds in turning us into alien political moon men, just because we refuse to be dark men. What we do , is to take responsibility for the problems of reality in respect for the equality of every single life lived. That is the radical course. And there is also a better answer to the refugee crisis than the answer that the current majority comes up with and believes they can cope with jewelry laws and things like that. But that's not always how we're perceived. And I thought about it a bit when I was in the United States the other day to understand what was going on during the American presidential election. And 80 percent of those who voted for Donald Trump, they thought people like them were better off 50 years ago. Eighty percent! And you know what? Some of them were right. Some of them live in places where, if not 50 years ago, in at least 10 and 20 years ago, there were more jobs, more opportunities for the children who grew up, and less poverty. And I was at home in Vejlby, north of Aarhus where I grew up, at my childhood home and celebrating my father's birthday, and then I put on my running shoes and ran for a walk on the nice path up to the primary school where I have gone. Then I looked around and thought: I don't think that things have changed significantly, and it can it's also good that it's some other children than Klaus and Tavs that I used to accompany to school. Denmark, the parents have to find that their children do not have the same opportunities in their local community as they had when they were growing up. I could get to any education offered in Denmark by bicycle from my childhood home. But in 2 out of 3 municipalities in Denmark do not have higher education. And this is a development that has only accelerated over the years, where 8 out of 10 new study places have ended up in the big cities. At the same time, we have a government, which, with its massive green harvest savings in the field of education, is well on its way to saving what corresponds to 17,000 positions in the education sector outside the capital. This means even fewer opportunities for those who already had the fewest. This means that the only thing that is to do is to merge the institutions, and then you have to accept that young people have a longer way to go. And that is why we say stop the savings and go ahead with the investments. young people and their worried parents: I can't promise that everyone will be able to cycle to their education. But we can guarantee that when we get it turned around, and every second education place is created outside the big cities, then we can do something like this , that no one in Denmark needs to move to get an education.*** But it is not only the young people outside the big cities who are challenged. I think that a great many people have been worried about seeing the development that has been over the summer with gang conflict, first in Odense, then in Aarhus. And over the summer it accelerated in Copenhagen to a degree with shooting episodes in front of the street, so the Copenhagen police are now telling young men, be careful where you go in the evening your city. Well, that's worrying. Radikale Venstre has to come forward there as well and say that we can see these challenges. I did it, I went out to N√∏rrebro, went for a walk and got into a conversation with three young people school students. And then I asked them, because I feel that they are the real victims in the gang conflict, how have your lives changed here? What has it meant that you now find yourself as helpless victims in a gang conflict? Then they said, yes Morten, It's not that bad. We live pretty much as we usually do. We go to school. We hang out. We do what we do now. We just have to stay away from Bl√•g√•rds Plads and from the shopping center on Fisketorvet and in Fields and a couple of S-togs stations and a single suburb. Then there are no problems. Well, that's the reality in Denmark. There are young people who walk around with a city map in their heads and think that's fine enough. It's all right. I just have to stop going over there, where there's a gang that has no place in it neighborhood where I grew up. And then I ask myself, what do we have to do so that the young people don't think that this is the way the world is, and that it's probably better to join one or the other gang? Yes, when the head of Copenhagen Police's Crime Prevention Department comes into his office on Monday morning, there are 25 desks behind him. And when he turns around to see how many people are actually available, there is one man, who works to counter radicalisation. All the others, they have been sent out to the airport, on guard duty or on patrol. There is not one person in the Copenhagen Police, apart from the chief himself, who works to prevent these young people from becoming the next gang members .It is a massive failure that we are going to struggle with for years if we do not now change the crazy prioritization of resources at the border, and all sorts of other places, instead of focusing where we can really make a difference for the young people who are the innocent victims in the gang conflict. Then I asked the boys, when you now look at your friends, those who end up in gangs, which fortunately are few in number, what characterizes them? They all say that it started at school. It started with not being able to cope, and then you fell for the offer of quick money and a nice lifestyle. And they said, Morten, we've gone to schools where everyone else looked alike ourselves. And that is why I have said that it is of no use that our principles stand in the way of us creating solutions that could enable us to deal with the divided schools. Because what is one of the most important principles, one of Radikale Venstre's hallmarks? It is the belief in a primary school, where our children and young people meet at intersections and where the parents get to know each other. Where we create a trusting society with respect for diversity. Where we know each other. Where we went to school together. But that is increasingly not the case in Denmark. And that is why we have said that now we must have a showdown with the divided schools. So that these young meets our children and children from all parts of Denmark in their schooling and can see that life is not, therefore, with that city map in your head, and that you will probably get by if you just don't step on the wrong one side of the square. It is our responsibility to ensure that all children experience that this is not what Denmark looks like if you look. And my basic point with all this is that we must take people's concerns seriously, regardless of whether it's about the refugee crisis, whether it's about opportunities where they live, or whether it's about the young people's chances through school life. And if we don't come forward and offer solutions to the real problems, then it will be all too easy for them, who just want to stand and live off the fact that the problems are there. Those who just want to stand and look at them and say: You can see what we said, but nothing will be done about it. We are a party that dares to think , dare to stand firm on our values, but also have our eyes firmly fixed on reality, because we know that this is the way in which we can create progress. Not just for the few, but for the many in our society, like them , who came before us, they did. And therefore I also want to say to you in conclusion that I cannot promise that we will have a new government in the autumn. I do not think that there will be any general election. Lars L√∏kke is enough for that happy to sit where he sits, regardless of what policy can be pursued. Nevertheless, we are going to elections. We are going to elections on 21 November for municipal and regional council elections. And I would like to send the clear message to all those who were radicals and voted for us in the last general election and all those who have become so since. All those who are going to vote for the first time and perhaps think that there was a bit of talk in what I have just stood and said: We need you! Because we won't get a single pedagogue into the daycare center or freedom back at the primary school if there isn't a strong radical representation in the local city council. And we won't be able to reverse the development in all parts of Denmark with education to everyone and take care of the vulnerable young people, if we are not represented in all the Danish regions. And therefore my message is: If you are a radical, or perhaps think you are becoming one, then vote radical on 21 November.

54485.0," By Mattias Tesfaye F 22 Urgent inquiry about the UN's migration declaration on 5.12.18 The spoken word applies. It sails! Let me start like this. I will not hide the fact that we in the Social Democrats are quite dissatisfied with the government's handling of this migration declaration. It has been more than two years since the government started negotiations with other countries on this UN declaration. But the government has not briefed us in the Folketing. And now the government comes and asks for understanding and support. And maybe a little forgiveness too... The Social Democrats are not going to make a fuss about Danish foreign policy. Denmark is the little boy in the global school yard. We need strong international cooperation. We need an international dialogue to deal with migration ‚Äì especially across the Mediterranean. According to the Constitution, it is the government that conducts foreign policy. It is a good provision. Of course, it gives the sitting government power. But it also assigns responsibility. A responsibility that we do not think the government has handled particularly impressively in this case. The Danish People's Party has called on the government to stay home from the conference in Morocco that will adopt the declaration next week. It is therefore obvious to everyone that the government needs the Social Democrats in this matter. We haven't noticed anything about that. On the contrary. We stand here on the sidelines and observe that the country's foreign policy on this point is sailing. Why do we only get the legal review of this declaration the day before this debate? Why do the government parties' own rapporteurs keep speaking against the declaration? Why do the government's own ministers not want to travel to Morocco and join the agreement they themselves negotiated? Why does the government keep claiming that this declaration strengthens the possibilities of repatriating rejected asylum seekers, when it is simply not true? The Prime Minister claims that the critics of the declaration are spreading false rumors about its content of the agreement. But it can come as no surprise to anyone that there is total confusion in the population after this chaotic course. I know that the autumn is always a busy period for the ministers. But being busy is no excuse. We are talking about the stability and credibility of our country's foreign policy. Furthermore, as I said, it has been over two years since the process started. It is politically tone-deaf that we are now standing here five minutes past twelve, and still have a debate marked by concerns and uncertainty. The Social Democrats have agreed with the government on a decision. It has required a bit of back-and-forth dialogue. I will not hide the fact that it has been crucial for the Social Democrats to have it cut out of cardboard that Danish immigration policy - according to the government's assessment - continues to be determined in the Folketing. It must be clear from the text that the government is attaching in Morocco. In addition, it has been crucial for us that the government also travels to Morocco and explains to the other countries that, from the perspective of a small Scandinavian welfare state, migration also has a downside. That there is a reason why we are tightening the immigration policy in Denmark. I am aware that it may not be so convenient for the government to say this so clearly on the international stage. Here, it gives a better atmosphere to let yourself be bathed in the flash light and enjoy the tolerability. But the government cannot celebrate the strict immigration policy with layer cake at home, and then hide our concerns abroad. The ministers must tell Morocco the same as it tells Mr. and Mrs. Denmark at home. Immigration is not just cake. That is why I look forward to the debate today. I look forward to the government giving a thorough and detailed account of its position on the Migration Declaration.Finally, on behalf of the Social Democracy and the government parties, I must read the following text for adoption: --Denmark is interested in international cooperation on cross-border challenges. The Folketing notes that - Denmark's strict immigration policy will not be changed. The UN's migration declaration - the declaration is not legally binding - the Folketing unchanged determines the immigration policy The Folketing calls on the government that the explanation of vote on Danish accession reflects the above and emphasizes the challenges that migration also entails.

55102.0,"""Daggers in the back"", ""Social mass grave"", ""Poverty pack"", ""Voter fraud"" ""Breach of promise"", Bloodbath"" - and what do I know. Yes, if an alien from a foreign planet suddenly landed in Denmark and saw how we lived and afterwards heard that the media has gone berserk over a series of economic adjustments - then that person would think we were crazy. The little green Martian would quickly get into his spaceship and fly away again. Yes, if any of you were to be in doubts, then the election campaign has started - it has been like that for a long time. And I promise you that it will be tough. Denmark is at a crossroads. Which way should we go? Should we continue on the good track we have found ourselves since the election in 2001? Or are we going back to a combination of the economic policy of the 1970s under Anker J√∏rgensen and the immigration policy of the 1990s under Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and Marianne Jelved? Memory is a strange thing. It only counts the bright hours. In our childhood, the sun always shone, and we only remember the holidays - just like in the ""Father of Four"" films. But the 1970s was the decade when Denmark stood on the edge of the economic abyss. And the 1990s were characterized by mass immigration. Many spin doctors and commentators enjoy making a kind of cockfight out of politics. They are only interested in the process itself, and they consider it a kind of sport to see which politicians get their messages off in the best way and who makes a fool of themselves. The ""spin programs"" shoot up like toadstools on TV, and it is certainly exciting to watch, but something is also missing. There is a lack of basic respect for the content itself. Politics is not only a question of power and influence. Politics is the framework for our everyday life. Politics is opportunities and limitations.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. A very warm welcome here to Lykkesholm. This is the eighth time we have met here, and these historical frameworks are firmly connected with the Danish People's Party. This is really Denmark at its best .Lykkesholm is history: Here in the castle, Denmark's adventure king H.C. Andersen's novel O.T.Lykkeholm is nature: Take a look out over the park, take a walk in the park during the break and listen to the cuckoo that peeps over on the other side of the lake. It has been a hard winter, and the summer has had difficulty get started. But now it seems that the heat is finally on its way. Politically, too, it has been an icy winter. The fronts in Danish politics have been drawn up more sharply than ever before. There have been times of crisis, but then it is not worse either - at least not in Denmark's case. First we were hit by the global financial and credit crisis, today it is a debt crisis that has been triggered because no one has had control over the EU's common currency, the euro. Isn't it really funny to think about: In 1999 and 2000, when discussions about the euro raged, an unholy alliance consisting of a massive political majority as well as trade unions, employers' organizations and economic experts tried to convince the Danes that a Danish accession to the euro was the only way forward. If we said no, we would be marginalized and ""lose influence"" - and then we could expect share prices to plummet. But what happened? The Danes said yes to the krone and no to the euro. And while in Germany it was the start of a historic crisis, the Danish shares and housing prices soared, but unemployment fell to the lowest level ever. Now we see the frightening consequences of the common currency. Had it not been for aid packages for staggering amounts of billions - which, of course, have also been paid for Denmark - Greece would have gone bankrupt. But the crisis is not over. Spain, Portugal and Ireland are also on their way. And the markets do not seem to be impressed by the EU's aid packages. How can they also have confidence in a currency and in a group of countries with so little control over things? Countries that consistently violate the rules that they themselves have helped to adopt. The Danish krone follows the euro up and down ‚Äì because of the fixed exchange rate policy. So far. How glad I am that we kept the krone. Not because our banknotes or coins are anything special, but because with our Danish krone we still have freedom and discretion. We are still masters of our own house. How good! I know that there are several people who have accused the Danish People's Party of economic irresponsibility. When we did not want to join the euro, it was probably because we wanted inflation and devaluations of the krone, just like in the 1970s. And then there have been all the accusations that we do not want reforms under any circumstances. This is completely wrong... I think that the Danish People's Party has shown in connection with the latest recovery package that we are not only thinking about the next election, but that we actually think about what is best for the Danes and Denmark - not just now, but also in two, five or ten years. We also want to ensure a good and secure future for our children and grandchildren. What actually happened? Yes, we stood in a quite serious situation, where the government wanted to save DKK 24 billion by freezing all transfer income - including pensions - for a two-year period. We were in a situation where the government wanted to save DKK four billion on the municipalities. Both parts got the Danish People's Party warded off. The Danish People's Party cannot of course accept that welfare is eroded. We do not think it is fair that pensioners who have toiled and dragged through their whole lives and who certainly do not have much to complain about should have to hold on to - or that some of the weakest groups, who are on transfer income and who do not have the resources to find employment, would be even worse off. Therefore, the maneuver consisted of finding the best solution. How do we achieve savings in the most painless way? The difficult choice fell on the unemployment benefit period and the amount of the child check. Pensioners and early pensioners cannot do much to change their situation, and most do not have the prospect of better incomes ever. children are not just something that the stork flies in with unannounced - and it is therefore not something that should be planned according to the size of the child check. There are families who have come forward and said that they would have planned differently if they had known the cuts to the child check that the government and DF have now implemented. I thought you had children out of love and not to get public benefits <U+0096> but then I became so wise. Receiving unemployment benefits is hopefully something temporary. There is talk about a group who would very much like to change their living situation. The unemployment benefit recipient is desperately looking for new work, and when the reform finally begins to take effect in two years, we will lack manpower. This is actually our biggest problem. The large cohorts are leaving the labor market, but the very serious shortage of labor in the future has been completely overshadowed by the current debate. The recovery package was necessary. Not because we are ""lying on our stomachs for the EU"" because of a so-called convergence requirement, but because we actually support the Danish fixed exchange rate policy, and because we want to preserve the Danish welfare model. Now the questions arise along the lines of, among other things, this: Is the Danish People's Party still the party of the little man? Yes, honestly, I almost don't want to answer the question because it's just so grotesque. It was among other reasons, we removed savings for the very weakest groups in this society. In their eagerness to spend money, the parties on the left forget that there is always a bill to pay for overspending - and that that bill always ends up with ""the little man ‚Äù ‚Äì just ask in Greece. Danish People's Party IS the party of the little man. We are the party of ALL Danes! We protect our values ‚Äã‚Äã<U+0096> and we protect all those who for one reason or another cannot themselves <U +0096> either because they are old, worn out or just weak. The Danish People's Party is the guarantee of justice and fairness. The Danish People's Party is the guarantee of both common sense and a warm heart. It hasn't changed a bit with the recovery package! But how does really on the left? Yes, for a while it looked as if the red flags were being packed away. The Social Democrats supported the tax freeze, and the trade union movement behaved quite pragmatically. At the Social Democrats' congresses, the red flags were discreetly placed out in side of the stage, and SF sent new signals by also hiding the red flags and replacing the sports hall with the Radisson Hotel in the well-preserved Frederiksberg. and the Socialist People's Party presented on the Stock Exchange to great fanfare their bid for a recovery of the Danish economy <U+0096> <U+0094>A fair solution<U+0094>. But first of all, it is a question whether it can be called <U+0094> U+0094>fair<U+0094> to require the wage earners to work <U+0094>12 minutes<U+0094> more a day when most of them are already grinding like beasts <U+0096> and secondly it is a question whether it is at all useful The Socialist Unity Party's <U+0094>Fair solution<U+0094> plans for increased public consumption in 2010 and 2011 <U+0096> Denmark is thus going in a completely different direction from the rest of Europe and the western countries. In addition, the plan itself lacks funding for somewhere between DKK 11 and 29 billion. Is it <U+0094>a fair solution<U+0094> to the problems we face?Is it <U+0094>fair<U+0094> to the Danes? With the left wing's solution, taxes and interest will rise The homeowners find themselves in a particularly precarious situation. But the trade union movement has chosen a side. The trade union movement has started to behave like a party <U+0096> or the third partner in <U+0094>The socialist Unity Party<U+0094>. But when ideology comes in, reason goes out. The LO summit recently rejected an effort for the long-term unemployed for half a billion kroner - because the government has the wrong color. The DKK 500 million was included in the recovery plan by the Danish People's Party. The trade union movement would much rather spend the members' money on campaigns against the government. The members do not come first - the power does. LO has financed one campaign in favor of the left wing after another - for the members' money. LO has not gone out of its way to tell grotesque lies like the one about the ""poor unemployed woman"" who turned out to have resigned HERSELF - for the members' money. LO portrays the Danish People's Party all over the country as the enemy of pensioners, because LO took an advance on the outcome of the negotiations on the recovery package - all for the members' money .The pensioners are completely exempt from cuts. But either this has not occurred to the trade union movement or they are speaking directly against better knowledge, because in large advertisements placed at bus stops and in taxis, for example, 3F claims that public pensioners must pay for Pia Kj√¶rsgaard's tax relief as a result of the agreement on the Recovery Package between the government and the DF. It is quite simply a lie. There is no more apt term. And of course they know it well. It just sounds smart, they think in 3F. They have decided to to spend the members' money on a campaign against DF in collaboration with the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party, whatever it takes - both in kroner and in truth. You all know that DF's agreement with the government NETOP meant that public pensioners - and early pensioners, SU recipients and people on unemployment benefit and other transfer income do NOT have their income frozen, as the government had proposed. That was removed by the DF. And for that matter, the DF also ensured, when the tax agreement was concluded last year, that both public pensioners and others with low incomes, got and gets tax breaks. In contrast to what the Tax Commission and the government had intended, and what SF's Ole Sohn found was <U+0094>within the scope<U+0094>! How embarrassing and pitiful it IS that the trade union movement has had to withdraw campaigns because the content is simply not true. 3F may as well start peeling their posters down from bus shelters all over the country, because their campaign is quite simply a lie from end to end. Today in this country we have four parties on the left wing: the Social Democracy, Socialist People's Party, Enhedslisten - and LO. Members of the first three parties have themselves chosen to be members of a political party, and they know exactly what their quota goes to. But the members of the many LO confederations are completely on the master's field. Even if they vote for the Danish People's Party or another of the bourgeois parties, they are nevertheless helping to support the left wing - because their trade union has ordered them to do so. I recognize that The trade union movement has done a lot of good. The trade union movement has helped to create the current Denmark. The trade union movement has created strong and self-aware wage earners - something that in his time led the old LO-Boss Thomas Nielsen to declare that the trade union movement had ""won through hell"" to"" - of course because the worker had been transformed into a ""capitalist"" with his own house and car. As prosperity grew, it became more and more natural that the worker could also vote bourgeois. But Harald B√∏rsting, Poul Erik Skov Christensen, the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party are working feverishly these days to reinvent the ""slave army of hunger"" - you can see it clearly: starving workers on the brink of a human existence, deprived of any form of human dignity, deprived of any form of humanity. People driven from home and home, while evil capitalists in top hats and in suits stand and laugh sinisterly and evilly! All because the unemployment benefit period has been shortened, the right to deduct professional quotas limited and the ceiling for the child check has been lowered - and then the sages even say that it is not enough - and that billions of kroner are still missing. Difficult to make everyone comfortable! There are other voices in the trade union movement. For example, FOA's chairman has warned against marriage with the left wing. This led LO boss Harald B√∏rsting to conclude that Dennis Kristensen must have ""a par sruer los"". The LO chairman used the same vulgar language after the recovery agreement had fallen into place, where he referred to the Danish People's Party as <U+0094>the government's dirty majority<U+0094>. I understand well that the Socialist People's Party's group chairman, Ole Sohn , thinks that the trade union movement must be ""class conscious"" and on ""the right team"". As communist chairman - right up to AFTER the wall had fallen - Ole Sohn had ample opportunity on numerous trips paid for by Moscow to study conditions in Eastern Europe in first-class hotels with everything paid for. Here he was taught, among other things, that workers who are bourgeois ( or who are - ""Marx and Lenin save us all!"" - PETTY BOURGIES) are subject to ""false class consciousness"" and that they must therefore be ""retrained"" for socialism. As is well known, part of this ""retrained"" took place in Stalin's GULAG camps and cost millions and millions of human lives. But that is not my point. Rather, the point is that Harald B√∏rsting and Poul Erik Skov Christensen arrogantly claim that THEY KNOW what is best for the Danish wage earner - and that on that basis they can afford to strap LO members to the left-wing bandwagon. And then there is SF and ""lune, nice Villy S√∏vndal"". Yes, maybe it is hard to believe that. But I have actually seen Villy S√∏vndal from a somewhat different side. I still remember how Villy S√∏vndal lost both his pipe and his temper in the parliamentary hall and complained to the Presidium of the Folketing because I had pointed out during an opening debate that Kristian Thulesen Dahl and I had been harassed by young SFU'ers during a demonstration on Christiansborg Castle Square. Yes, I was even threatened with a police report... It was ridiculous. It was embarrassing beyond all limits... But it showed that ""smiling Villy with the twinkle in his eye and his head tilted"" is a pure media construct. And I'm almost impressed the advisers who, with a large toolbox, have sat and pieced together Villy S√∏vndal as a kind of political playmobil figure. Here is the crooked smile. Here is the pipe. Here are some harsh words for Hizb-ut-Tahrir and gender-segregated parent meetings at school. Here is a little for the business world, and here is a little for the fringe areas. The New Socialist People's Party must embrace and include everyone. But Villy S√∏vndal has been controlled by such a spin doctor that Nyrup with the bicycle helmet seems honest and genuine next to it. When S√∏vndal was the other day by Ekstra Bladet asked if he basically didn't want to pay a little extra in tax, now that he had said during the parliamentary debate that he was prepared to do so. And that everyone should. But S√∏vndal had to ask an adviser first before he could answer, what he basically meant. The answer was not particularly surprising: S√∏vndal would not voluntarily pay more in taxes. So how stupid do they really think we are? The simple truth is that the Socialist People's Party IS a socialist party. The party's program states there in black and white that the goal is socialism, and you don't have to listen long to some of the party's young stars like Thor M√∂ger Petersen and Mattias Tesfaye before you see through the false media construction. that no one should be able to earn more than 50,000 kroner a month - before tax. Which cannot surprise anyone when you consider that Tesfaye previously belonged to the extreme party DKP/ML - Marxist-Leninists. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.In recent months we have got the impression that everything in life is crisis, money and welfare. Unfortunately, this has meant that the important value debate has been pushed into the background. And I actually don't think that the two things can be separated. It's absurd to talk about economy and welfare without at the same time talking about value politics - because the two things are connected like a straw. The Danish welfare society is not based solely on graphs and charts, but on flesh and blood people. Everyone wants to receive - but not everyone wants to pay. The Danish welfare society and Danish democracy are the result of a completely unique historical cohesion. It is the cohesion that makes Danes willing to pay half of their salary to the community. It is the cohesion that causes us to feel a responsibility for each other. Without cohesion, no welfare! It's that simple! If all able-bodied people in this country contributed to the community, it would not have been necessary to save 24 billion kroner. There are still far too many foreigners who are never really "" the country in Denmark"". Mentally, they are still in their home country. Everyone praises the word ""global"" - but they forget that the global society with its modern communication technologies such as satellite TV and the Internet makes it possible to remain ""local"" throughout life. This means that an immigrant from Lebanon or Turkey does not have to give up his favorite television programs or daily contact with family members in the distant homeland. This is how it is possible to live in Denmark - without having any contact with the surrounding society .It is not only a socio-economic problem. It is just as much a human problem. The immigrants who have no contact with the labor market are in many cases also the immigrants who refuse to recognize basic western values ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as democracy and freedom - and who are oppressive to women and medieval in their view of humanity. To them we must make demands, demands and more demands !The message must be: Come and join our community.Be Danish!Give your contribution - then we will probably do our part to ensure that we get on well together.And to the immigrants who, for one reason or another, do not want to be with, shall we say: Go home! You have no right to anything! You will never be happy here! Unfortunately, the debate has been somewhat forgotten! And that suits the Social Democracy and the Socialist People's Party brilliantly. The two parties avoid the immigration debate like the plague. Either because they don't have an answer - or because they know that the answer will make the Danes worried. Villy S√∏vndal has played the role of strongman several times. Yes, he once said brazenly that the extremists in Hizb-ut-Tahrir could ""go to hell to"". But he didn't want to vote for a ban on the extremists! And Villy S√∏vndal was out with the rake again against gender-separated parent meetings at Holbergsskolen in Copenhagen's Northwest quarter. Right up until his own hinterland got him knocked into place! Then no more was heard about that case - and THEREFORE the economic crisis came as if called from heaven. Neither the Social Democrats nor the Socialist People's Party DARE or WANT to take up the debate on the immigration policy. But I promise you that we will probably take it up for them! The Danes have a right to clear information about the immigration policy, which will be led by a possible S-SF government - with the help of Enhedslisten and Det Radikale Venstre. Which parts of the current strict immigration policy will be dismantled first? The start-up aid? The 24-year rule? Danish citizenship? I have to admit that our friends in the government are also a bit lax on this point. Make no mistake. It is not Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen's fault. Anders Fogh Rasmussen was on the run from the value debate when he had his eyes fixed on international top posts, and the Conservatives can't figure it out at all. Mostly they sound like the radicals, and when they finally try, they stumble well and truly in the burka. Recently, we have seen that the word <U+0094>integration <U+0094> does not appear at all in the government's so-called 360-degree review of the primary school. I otherwise think that it is an urgent topic <U+0096> especially because even top social democratic politicians opt out of the primary school. This is a big task for the government. At the same time do we also see that top Social Democrats allow themselves to be admitted to private hospitals when their health is in trouble. No, the value debate is certainly not dead. And when no one else wants to take it up, I promise that the Danish People's Party will take it up. We cannot make welfare policy without to think about the value policy as well - these are two sides of the same coin. Denmark has come a long way in the last almost nine years with a VOK majority. There have been ups and downs, but there has also been good cooperation. A cooperation which for the most part has been characterized by mutual respect and responsibility. There are not many examples of something similar in recent Danish history. have ever experienced. But the Danish People's Party is ready. We have the vast majority of candidates in place for the upcoming general election. Since the spring, Kristian Thulesen Dahl and I have been out meeting the voters at our tour&eacute meetings throughout the country - the meetings will also continue in August. We don't know anything about the election itself - other than that it will be held no later than November 2011. But we are ready - and fully equipped for the fight! Come on!

56075.0," Kristian Thulesen Dahl's weekly newsletter - Monday 18 January 2016 Wednesday will be the day! - If the Social Democracy is of any use, the Folketing has an urgent inquiry into the refugee and migrant situation on Wednesday. With the latest announcements from the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, this should be the day when the Folketing sets a new course. Takes the municipalities' concerns seriously. More on that later. First a little about the border control! Border control is common sense. Because every country has a completely natural interest in keeping an eye on who and what enters the country. But in the EU system, they obviously don't care about common sense. Thus, on Sunday evening, TV2 carried an interview with the EU's migration commissioner, the Greek Dimitris Avramopoulos, in which the commissioner said that the current Danish border control may only last until 3 February. Because he wants to return to what he calls <U+0094>normal conditions<U+0094>. So, what exactly is happening to the EU? And just what kind of <U+0094>normal conditions<U+0094> does the Commissioner want to return to? If you scrutinize the commissioner's statements, however, the motive is clear: border controls must go away for ideological reasons. So never mind how the reality turns out otherwise. For Avramopoulos explains that he fears a snowball effect, where even more other countries also introduce border controls. It will endanger Schengen cooperation, he says, and Schengen is <U+0094>one of the greatest things we have achieved in our time<U+0094>. It is therefore the ideology, the dream of a supranational EU, that preoccupies the commissioner. Not solving the current problems. And border control helps to solve the current problems! Even if the current border control at the Danish-German border is just a random check, it has a clear effect. On the first day alone, 18 were refused entry, and three people were also arrested and charged with human trafficking. After ten days, the result was that 203 people had been rejected, while 24 had been charged with human trafficking. Add to that the preventive effect. That it is rumored that there is a risk of being caught, which may deter migrants and human traffickers from trying. After all, we know that these are often amazingly well-informed when it comes to conditions in countries such as Germany, Sweden and, of course, Denmark. In addition, all the talk about chaos and huge traffic jams at the border has certainly been to instill fear about what a border control means. Because when the media these days report from the border control, the picture is typically that things are going well and that, moreover, completely understandable, there is great support for continuing with the security that the control provides. So no: We are not going back to the EU's <U+0094>normal conditions<U+0094>. On the contrary, we must strengthen and expand border control! And then back to the Folketing's debate on Wednesday. The day when we once again put the municipalities' justified rebellion about all the refugees and migrants they are to receive on the agenda. Decisions are urgent. The Folketing must get started! There are plenty of options. For example, with a majority in the Folketinget, we can decide on the establishment of refugee villages, which will be a relief for the municipalities. Refugee villages ‚Äì or refugee centers as we have called them ‚Äì where you get protection until you can be sent to the surrounding area or your home country again. Where you are, until we get the immigration policy completely restructured, so that in future asylum seekers can get help in the local area instead of applying to Denmark. Those who subsequently come to Denmark must then be sent to the local area where the help takes place. The Danish People's Party knows where it stands on these issues. We are fully prepared to make the decisions. But what about the other parties? At the weekend, the Social Democrats' group chairman, Henrik Sass Larsen, told Jyllands-Posten that establishing asylum camps in the surrounding areas is the best solution to the huge challenge we are facing. That the world's refugees should be gathered in well-functioning refugee cities closer to the surrounding areas, after which countries in, for example, Europe must decide for themselves how many refugees the country in question wants to accept. Sweet music to our ears. And instead of being upset that the Social Democrats have previously opposed just such a policy when we have proposed it in the Folketing, we will be happy that they have now come to the realization. Let us therefore now concentrate on how we get action behind the words! Both when it comes to refugee villages and help in the surrounding areas instead of here in Denmark. Because the Danes are crying out for action when it comes to getting the asylum and migrant challenges taken care of. Justified! Therefore, let Wednesday be the day when we take a giant step in the right direction. Where a majority in the Danish Parliament recognizes that now is the time to act! The Conservatives have declared themselves ready. If the Social Democracy is of any use, we together have the opportunity. Let's make things happen! So Mette Frederiksen, are you ready?

57257.0," Close to terror in Denmark? Sulfur and aluminum powder for making bombs. Cannon shots, lighters and other pyrotechnics. Flag of the terrorist organization Islamic State, peppered with Korans with passages crossed out about how to fight the infidels. A search of an address in Germany has led to sinister clues to Denmark. And this week, in the Holb√¶k area, 13 people were imprisoned on suspicion of terrorist plots. Scary to think what this case could have ended up with had we not had our vigilant and capable police and intelligence services. Thanks to them! The case is yet another reminder that Islamic fanaticism must be taken very seriously. There are people who wish us harm and therefore must be fought. It's simple self-defense! Unfortunately, we see far too much naivety from other parties regarding the threats of Islamism. This has particularly come to the fore in recent months, when there has been increasing pressure, especially from the government's support parties, to repatriate the children who are in prison camps in Syria and who were born to Danish citizens. Increasing political pressure from Enhedslisten, Radikale Venstre and SF. The other day Venstres Ungdom followed suit in the fight to get the children ""home"". You have to take care of your head! The naivety has reached far into bourgeois ranks. Every time the discussion comes up, however, there is one important point that the ""good-hearted"" deftly avoid talking about: That the horrible terrorist parents will follow along! The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights will most likely mean that we cannot prevent the parents from bringing the children to Denmark. Niqab-wearing women who have actively supported the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. And subsequently the fathers who may have fought with rifles and roadside bombs. Imagine if their fight had succeeded! Then they had not wanted to come to Denmark again. But now that they failed they are in a hurry to get to the promised land. Here, where hardworking Danes provide a welfare society, where you can get cash assistance and education for the children. Just tell me: How naive do we have to be? The dream of the caliphate is still alive and well among women in the camps, where there have been thought-provoking examples of how the women crack down on anyone who steps outside the Islamic state's fanatical Islamic guidelines. When journalists visit the camps, it is often like entering the caliphate. For example, read this article from a DR visit to the Al-Hol camp in Syria. https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/udland/dr-besoeger-lejr-i-syrien-det-er-som-vaere-i-califatet The female IS executioners cling to what made the hair stand on end rise up on the rest of us when Islamic State had its heyday. I'm probably not the only one who will never forget the images we saw when the Islamic State was wreaking havoc. They murdered and raped. Among other things, it went badly for the Yazidis ‚Äì a tribe that the Islamic State considers infidels. Men were brutally murdered. Their severed heads were put on sticks. Their bodies were dragged through the streets. Yazidi women - and girl children - were captured and used as sex slaves in the IS terrorists' private homes, where they otherwise lived with their IS wives. There are accounts of sex slaves who were as young as eight years old. They were bought and sold as if they were not living beings. Read one of the gruesome reports here: https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2017-02-26-sexslave-hos-islamisk-stat-jeg-var-14-aar-da-de-bandt-mig- fixed-to-a-bed-and It is estimated that around 10,000 Yazidis were either abducted or killed by the Islamic State. The IS women played an active role in building the Islamic caliphate. They were accomplices. Fortunately, the Islamic State was beaten back and the remnants of the terror regime are now in prison camps in Syria. Among other things, in the al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria, where a 4-year-old girl is trapped with her mother, who traveled to Syria in 2014 to join the Islamic State. It is, among other things, those that the ""good-hearted"" are now fighting to get to Denmark. The girl's mother was otherwise fully aware of the decision she made in 2014. She made a decision that she wanted to be a terrorist for the Islamic State and on that day she also made a decision that she was no longer Danish. Although on paper she may be a Danish citizen, in my eyes she has written off Denmark when she went down and fought for an Islamist terrorist organization. The 4-year-old girl has never experienced anything other than being part of the Islamic State. She has never been to Denmark. Denmark has enough problems with Islamists. We have seen that this week with the arrests in the Holb√¶k area. Islamic State's executioners are unfortunately already in Denmark. They must be fought tooth and nail - and in the meantime we don't need to import more of the same kind. The IS mothers and their children are therefore not going to Denmark! The government must not think of that as a possibility at all. I am therefore raising an inquiry debate in the Folketing to the Prime Minister to get a guarantee that Denmark will not invite these people in again!

53566.0," When you have followed the latest debate on foreign labour, you could almost get the impression that Danish companies will come to a complete standstill if we do not import more slaughterhouse workers from e.g. Africa. There are voices in the public debate who believe that any restriction on immigration is evil. And that immigration is fundamentally a necessity and an enrichment for Danish society. And with that, of course, it is also understood that it almost amounts to a nationally damaging activity when we in the Danish People's Party want to limit immigration to Denmark. But is that also true? Is immigration an enrichment? Or perhaps rather a burden? I believe that immigration from Middle Eastern countries in particular has been and is a burden for Denmark. It is actually also documented on all fronts and edges. For us in the Danish People's Party, it is therefore also crucial not just to curb immigration, but also to ensure a real paradigm shift in immigration policy. We must ensure that refugees who come all the way to Denmark are helped here temporarily. That it is not a shortcut to a permanent future in Denmark that you can pay a human trafficker to bring you here. One must return to one's homeland when the opportunity arises and help rebuild one's fatherland. It is the only right thing for the sake of the homeland, but it is also necessary if we want to pass Denmark on as a safe nation to the next generations. I have written about this in previous weekly letters. I have also mentioned on several occasions the 33 billion kroner that non-Western immigration cost the public coffers in 2014 alone. The price is extremely high. You can also make sure of this if you leaf through the publication ""Immigrants in Denmark 2017"", which Statistics Denmark published in November. It's not encouraging reading, I can tell you. It is, for example, a disheartening experience to see the employment statistics for people from some of the countries from which most asylum seekers have come over the years. In 2016, 79 percent of Somali women aged 30-59 were on public welfare. For men, the figure was 66 percent. For Afghan men, the figure was 49 percent. For Syrian women, it was 94 percent. Enrichment? Or rather a burden? In many ways it is even more disheartening when you look at the crime statistics. Because here you also have to think about the many victims and not just cold hard cash. In 2016, 15 times more male Somali descendants aged 15-79 were convicted of violence (3.0 percent) than the average of men in Denmark (0.2 percent). In the same year, 18.1 percent of male Somali descendants were convicted of a crime. For male Syrian descendants, the figure was 20.7 percent. More than one in five! Enrichment? Or rather a burden? Statistics have also been produced that show how many people born in 1987 have been convicted of breaking the criminal law by the age of 28. This means relatively serious crimes. For Danes, the figure is 17 percent. It actually surprised me that it was so high. But what about non-Western immigrants? 42 percent! Enrichment? The mentioned publication is freely available on the website of Statistics Denmark, should you wish to learn more about the blessings and costs of immigration. However, I want to warn in advance that it is not reading that puts you in a good mood... And what is the point of all these numbers and statistics? To show that immigration from non-Western countries overall has been and is harmful to Denmark. Economic, social, cultural. A huge burden. We must reverse the trend. This requires a completely new course in immigration policy, the so-called ""paradigm shift"". It requires action. Real changes. And not just nice words on a piece of paper. This is what we are fighting for. I am pleased when I hear Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen say that he also wants refugees to only be in Denmark temporarily. It is excellent. I will hold him and the government up to it, because action is now more important than words. Let's turn the good intentions into reality.

55526.0," REFUGEES Rules for family reunification are one of the few tools we have to ensure a balance between the number of foreigners and integration. I don't know any social democrats who entered politics with a desire to tighten the rules for family reunification. So why do we do just that? There is primarily one reason for this: it is one of the few tools we have to ensure the right balance between the number of foreigners and integration. Why is it so crucial? Because the situation is serious. Last year, 21,000 asylum seekers came to Denmark. This is historically high. This year, it is expected that more than 36,000 refugees and family reunified people will go to the municipalities. It is equivalent to building a completely new city the size of Viborg or K√∏ge. And that's just this year. If the situation was temporary, we might be able to handle it. But there is no indication that it is. The world has become smaller, and many will ‚Äì understandably ‚Äì seek a better life in the north. The conditions in the surrounding areas are so miserable that refugees would rather risk their lives on the journey to Europe. And they are joined by an increasing number of migrants from, among other places, North Africa. This puts us in a difficult dilemma. On the one hand, it is deeply in our nature to protect people on the run. Help around the world. Take responsibility. On the other hand, it is equally clear that the challenge we face is so extensive that we, as a small country, cannot solve it alone. As Prime Minister Anker J√∏rgensen said it already in 1987: ""It is a problem with the many refugees and immigrants. We must be careful not to be overrun, because there are limits to how many refugees a small country like Denmark can take in"". That is why we have tightened immigration policy in recent years. Also when we were in government ourselves. In order to avoid three consequences of an excessive influx: First, that it may be necessary to implement savings on welfare year after year. Many municipalities have already started. Because of the government's negative growth. Large new expenses will slowly erode the universal welfare model, which is the prerequisite for a just Denmark. Secondly, our cohesion will be challenged. There are many immigrants who live good lives in Denmark and who contribute to our society. We must appreciate that. But already today there are too many with a non-Western background who are not in work, who do not speak the language and who do not share our values. And thirdly, it will go beyond the parts of our society that are already tackling the difficult challenges of integration in everyday life. The areas where there are too many bilingual children in schools. The residential areas that are already exposed. And the places in our labor market where wages are low. Isn't there anything else we can do other than tighten the family reunification rules? Not very much. We use the tools that are within the conventions. It will, among other things, more difficult to obtain permanent residence. The government has already this summer ‚Äì without our support ‚Äì reduced benefits. There is little evidence that this had any significant effect. On the contrary, it will make integration more difficult for those who are in Denmark. Denmark is not alone in trying to limit the influx. In other countries too, the rules for family reunification are being tightened - in recognition that it is one of the few realistic tools available. In Germany, a limit of 2 years will be introduced. In Norway, a limit of 5 years is being discussed. In Sweden, some groups cannot get family reunification at all. As a government, we ourselves introduced a limit of 1 year. It is the one that is now being raised to 3 years. Is it against the international conventions? No, is the government's assessment. For us, it goes without saying that Denmark must of course comply with our international obligations. We will hold the government to that. Moreover, these are obligations that mean that the tightening of the family reunification rules will only cover a clear minority of those who come here ‚Äì namely those who are not personally persecuted. Eight out of ten of the asylum seekers who come to Denmark are personally persecuted. And therefore they have the right to get their families here immediately. The tightening does not change that. It is obvious that some social democrats have a hard time with the austerity measures that have now been implemented. Especially the issue of family reunification. I understand that. I think we assess the situation differently. My clear assessment is that we have to act if we want to preserve the social model that the Social Democrats have built up over generations. Because the challenge we face is permanent. I don't think this is a temporary situation. At the same time ‚Äì and this cannot be emphasized enough ‚Äì the task we are now facing is of a different nature: Namely, seriously securing more help for the surrounding areas. The government has cut development aid. It happens at the worst possible time. More assistance is needed. More international solidarity. We Social Democrats will fight for that. If we do not do something about the root of the problem, the flow of refugees to Denmark and Europe will continue.

56826.0," Chronicle by Mette Frederiksen, chairman of the Social Democratic Party Braught in Politiken, Saturday 8 December 2018 Yes we can, Obama said ten years ago and redeemed a hope in a whole world that longed for something to believe in. Hope. Change. Everything is somehow more grandiose and emotional in America, and it was especially so that night when Obama had won the presidential election in 2008 and gave his victory speech in front of 125,000 people in Chicago. I remember quite clearly how we were sitting on the couch with my then three-year-old son, and watched Obama talk about all that was now going to happen. And Magne looked up at me and asked: ""Why are you crying?"". Apart from the fact that it obviously says something about me being prone to tears - it also confirms the eternal truth about children, that the world is new to your eyes. If you don't know that only a few generations ago slavery existed, it is no mean feat for a black man to be elected president. And if you don't know about the cynicism of power, it can be difficult to understand that your mother can be moved only by ideals and beautiful values ‚Äã‚Äãexpressed in equally beautiful words. But I was. And the election of Obama was an achievement. Once again, humanity moved towards an increasingly equal society. Here at home, Piet Hein already wrote it decades before in his rant about faith and hope: ""The pessimists are the purest fools, however - they believe in the opposite of what they hope for. No, the optimists on whom life depends are those who dare to hope for something they believe in"". This daring to hope for something you believe in is just not without some risk. Disappointment as the closest. Expectations can burst, and when reality meets hope it is rarely so bright green. Why are there still patients lying in the corridors when one party after another in I don't know how many election campaigns have promised to get it under control? Why are public servants still surrounded by huge bureaucracy when we politicians have been talking about doing something about it for decades? And why has it still not succeeded in breaking the negative social legacy, when we at Christiansborg apparently agree that ""everyone must join""? It's a clich√©, but that doesn't make the point any less true: There are no quick fixes. No finger snapping. Obama also disappointed many voters, crushed dreams and left structural inequality. And, among other things, as a result of that, Trump became president. Politics is difficult. And as with everything else involving people, we politicians make mistakes too. The big changes that have really moved Denmark are probably easier to spot when we see them in historical light. When I was very young myself, I was often impatient with the Social Democrats. Back then, I don't think the 90s government did enough to solve society's social problems. When we look back today, we see a social democratic government that broke unemployment and brought Denmark into the international community. Does this mean that you, as a Dane, should not have high expectations for a social democratic government if we get the opportunity to form one after the election? No, of course not. But we are not going to be able to fulfill it all. I, and all other politicians, must be honest about that, without people losing faith in politics for that reason. That together we can change Denmark and the world into a better place. I am concerned about the hopelessness towards politics that I encounter in many people. The unnecessary intransigence even between people who have a lot in common. I have written this chronicle for those of you who can sometimes be disappointed with Social Democracy. Those of you who say that you find it difficult to see the differences in Danish politics. Who think we are too tactical. When I meet you, you call for a combination of clear answers, uncompromising opposition, confrontation, new thinking, classic values, enthusiasm and hope. Something I understand well. I would like to challenge others. And at the risk of it being deliberately misunderstood and simplified in a headline, I will start with ourselves in the Social Democratic Party. I don't know anyone who went into politics out of anything other than a burning desire to influence development in the direction they now think is right. That was also why I myself, as a very young person, joined Denmark's Social Democratic Youth. I was impatient, I was indignant and I wanted to make a difference. I still want to. But time has taught me that politics is also a sword dance between reality and vision. Where journalists ask: Can you refuse? Can you guarantee? Yes or no! Time is crying out for clear answers. You can relate to that, you can understand that. I meet many people who are calling for very clear answers from the Social Democrats. I kind of understand that, but when the Danes choose to make up the Folketing with so many different parties, none of us get the mandates to decide for ourselves. Neither do we social democrats. This is why the reservation is a good companion to have as a politician. We often use that together with the eternal 'but'. Woe to him who promises something he cannot keep. So we don't. And thus, paradoxically, we erode the value of our position. No one can suspect voters of withdrawing the caveat from the statement, and all that remains is what we say in small print: Vote for us - but you are bound for four years without the right of cancellation. I understand if it can seem disturbing. But I would still like there to be a greater understanding of the humility and responsibility it also expresses. In the Social Democrats we make an effort not to promise more than we can keep. Take public consumption as a good example. We will let money follow when there are more children and elderly people. It is better than the government's alternative, which is effectively cuts to the current service. But is it ambitious? No. It is a minimum. And I will fight hard so that we can go even further. I just don't want to promise anything I don't feel sure we can deliver afterwards. And that is why my promise to the Danes is more a direction than a concrete policy. We are going to the election on our social democratic programme. It is specific. Abolish the re-prioritisation contribution on the programmes. Local hospitals and a showdown with centralisation. Combating plastic pollution. Right and duty for all immigrant women to come to work. We will fight for that, but I can't promise that it will be adopted in an increasingly fragmented parliament. What I can promise, however, is the direction we will work in and for as a government; Fighting inequality, choosing welfare over tax cuts, a more ambitious climate effort and ensuring a strict immigration policy and at the same time better help in the surrounding areas. On that basis, we will always seek to create results. For me, the decisive factor is not the firmness with which one can express one's views. It is not least important if you are able to realize them at the same time - which is a task that is never finished when you strive for a society with ever greater social justice. Perhaps we could find each other again in the very basic realization that hope and disappointment are connected and that political visions are not rendered toothless by realism. Views can change, reality can surprise, compromises can be made. This is actually how we built Denmark. In families, associations, local communities, at workplaces and yes ‚Äì in politics. It was Svend Auken who reminded us in his political testament that there is nothing but white stripes and dead flies in the middle of the road. With the important and often overlooked addition that ""the results in a democracy are often created when people with different starting points meet in the middle of the road and find joint solutions"". One of the cornerstones of the welfare society ‚Äì the public pension ‚Äì was e.g. only mentioned an passant in Jens Otto Krag's book ""Kamp og fornyelse"" which covers 1955-1971. And who knows which of the decisions of which time will go down in history when, in a few decades, you look back at Denmark at the beginning of the 21st century? Will it be us who come to grips with the fact that in every 9th grade there are on average four students who leave primary school without being able to write, read or do arithmetic well enough? Will it be us who succeed in breaking the relationship that to this day it is still one's birth certificate that says the most about what opportunities one gets in this life? Will it be us who fundamentally make our society greener, recycle more and pollute less so that we can leave a sustainable planet to our children and grandchildren? And will it be us who slow down the increasing inequality, take care of the crisis of confidence in our society and who insist that Denmark is too small for big differences? These are four tasks that will be some of the most important for a social democratic government. Knowing that no government - regardless of who may be prime minister - can tackle challenges this big in one election period alone. I know politics makes a difference. And I know there are differences in politics. Differences that are currently heralded as nuances, but which nevertheless have a noticeable meaning for those it is about. If you are e.g. one of the many who are worn out after decades on the labor market, then you can be happy that we prevented the government from raising the retirement age further. And if you want to know what half a year means, ask a paver! In the value-political exchange, where polarizing views are traded, this kind of thing does not always have a high value. For others ‚Äì myself included ‚Äì the problem is more that there is no real progress in preventing a step back. You are still standing in the same place as before. This is how it is when the Social Democrats are in opposition. We do not have enough mandates to pull Denmark in the direction we want. But with attitude and cooperation, we can avoid the worst setbacks. Our cooperation with the Danish People's Party has been much discussed. But we saw in the 00s what happened when the Danish People's Party only cooperated with the blue parties. At the time, we did not succeed in preventing unfunded tax cuts, a severe centralization of Denmark in the form of the municipal reform, a de facto abolition of late pay and a halving of the unemployment benefit period in the midst of a serious economic crisis. Our bitter experience is that it is so easy to break down and so hard to build up. Instead, we could really record differences. You and us. Our plan, their plan. You have a choice! And we lost that election. The Danes composed the Folketing in a way that probably gave us a majority to form a government, but which at the same time made it impossible for us to change the most unjust decisions. It taught me that it is not worth much to be able to look at yourself in the mirror if you also see in the mirror a society that is less solidary and more divided. I have made it my project to win even more Danes' trust in Social Democracy. I have no illusions that it can be fully successful before the next election. People want ‚Äì justifiably ‚Äì to have an opinion on the matter. It is only if we are again entrusted with government responsibility that we can put action behind attitude. And with the greatest possible respect for the generations of politicians on whose shoulders we stand, it will be my claim that it has become more difficult to conduct politics today. This is not least due to globalisation, which has certainly brought good things with it. Primarily, it has given more and more people worldwide a share in prosperity and development. This has created an economic cooperation which helps to prevent conflicts. And that makes it possible to spread democracy and human rights. But globalization has also led to rampant inequality, of which just one grotesque example is the crazy fact that barely 50 people together own as much as the poorest half of the world's population. And right now we are all witnessing one more scandalous revelation after another. What is worse: money laundering for billions in honorable banks or unscrupulous fraud by states? It negates all notions of normality. The world has, for better or for worse, become smaller, and that makes it harder to hide the painful truth that elected politicians no longer have the decisive vote. The climate knows no national borders, multinational corporations can move fortunes around overnight, terror strikes everywhere and propaganda and fake news spread with lightning speed. And the truth is that no Danish law can seriously change that. Is it too wild to ask whether the greatest threat to democracy is no longer fascism, communism or Nazism, but instead an as yet uncontrollable globalization? Where decisions of significant importance to society and people are taken by individuals without the shadow of a democratic mandate. Countering it requires much stronger international political cooperation, despite all the flaws and shortcomings it will have. It requires a willingness to regulate market forces, as we have done with great success in Denmark. In short, it requires more politics. Much more politics. No less politics. Not just in Denmark. But in the EU, UN and all other international contexts. It requires more cooperation. More compromises. And fewer conflicts. It is therefore also worrying if we imagine to each other that results only count if they turn out exactly as you would like them to be. This must be taken into account.

57152.0," Read Mette Frederiksen's full speech for the opening debate 2017 - The spoken word counts. The clause right to the spoken word is said. - On Wednesday I was on √Ür√∏. Lovely place. Lots of commitment. Tourism lives well. New projects are launched. But there are also challenges. Relocation. Adults who are on transfer income. The government has presented its big tax plan. And let's test that plan in relation to √Ür√∏. I hope √Ür√∏ has not turned his nose up at much from the bourgeois government. Because the conclusion is as clear as it is unfair. Together with Langeland, √Ür√∏ is the two municipalities in the country where the citizens get the least out of the government's tax plan. Now I understand that √Ür√∏ will soon be visited by the Prime Minister. And there you can say: What's the point of a tax cut if you can have the Prime Minister visit instead? But the prime minister will be busy if he has to visit all the parts of Denmark that are neglected by the government. Because is it better for Sams√∏? The answer is no. Nor is it the case for Lolland and Bornholm. It looks completely different in Gentofte, H√∏rsholm and Rudersdal. It is the municipalities that benefit the most from the tax reductions. The government is pulling Denmark wrong. The government pursues policy for the few. Those who already have the most. Venstre was once a party concerned with the small local communities. It's not like that anymore. The last parliamentary year passed with large, broad agreements. About housing tax. Windmills. North Sea. Gang pack. And new parties came into government. I would like to congratulate the Liberal Alliance on the Liberal fingerprints. There was no flat tax on housing. Plans for a higher retirement age were dropped. And everything from jogging on bridges to the internet in high schools has been banned. The Danish economy is healthy. Employment is going well. Vacancy is low. But we also face five major challenges. This applies above all in the field of integration. Thousands of refugees and foreigners have come to Denmark. More than we have been able to integrate into our society. Many have learned the language. Is in work and education. It is well. But that doesn't apply to everyone. There are women with a foreign background who are not part of the labor market. Parallel society is now a reality. Social control is exercised against girls. Radicalization. The gang conflict. It is the flip side of a wrong immigration policy. Two: There is a lack of time, care and resources in welfare. One in four cancer patients do not receive the treatment they need on time. Employees are running strong because of a productivity requirement that has outlived itself. It is well known that large savings rounds have been carried out. Also in the field of education. And that brings me to the third big challenge. Many companies already lack qualified labour. Blacksmiths, engineers, electricians. If we look a little further, the problem will only grow bigger. It is financially irresponsible when the government does not want to ensure that Danes get the necessary skills. And we risk ‚Äì as the fourth challenge ‚Äì that Denmark is skewed even more. Much has been centralized in Denmark. Fewer local police officers are on the streets. Young people outside the big cities have had fewer educations to choose from. The government is now planning further centralization. Production schools must be closed down. Denmark is drawn crookedly. The differences are getting bigger. And finally, the fifth challenge: Unrest on the international stage. An aggressive Putin in the east, who is rearming and threatening Denmark's safety and security. A new American president in the West who is scaling back the necessary efforts in the climate area. The world is blowing. And here at home the government is about to terminate the special Danish contract on which we have built our society. A contract that has ensured a strong social safety net for decades. Growth and development throughout the country. Low inequality. Therefore also a good competitiveness. The government bases its policy on the opposite of what has made Denmark strong. The green transition is treated stepmotherly. Great words from the Prime Minister in New York. No to coastal wind turbines here at home. Those who already have the most must have more. Those who most need a strong welfare society must have less. The challenges Denmark faces are big and real. But we can solve them. It requires a new policy. It requires a government that will solve Denmark's problems. In this parliamentary year, we will be particularly concerned with five things. Specifically: A showdown with parallel societies. The Muslim independent schools that do not benefit the cohesion must be closed. Where do we have the Left? Will the government be involved? We must continue to pursue a strict immigration policy. Not least because the integration must improve. Border control must be maintained. And the security of the Danes must be ensured in connection with the upcoming defense settlement. We will spend more money on safety and security. Care cannot be made more efficient. We will be getting older in the coming years. Fortunately. But it costs. Also because we want better welfare. Therefore: We must do things in the right order. Treatment of cancer and dignity in care for the elderly must be in place before we have to talk about tax breaks. So must a proper school for our children. Welfare is also about fighting the inequality that many children and young people grow up in. More growth. We want a higher deduction for the companies that want to do research here in Denmark. And we want to ensure that young people enter the labor market faster. Concretely, we propose e.g. graduate jobs. So an engineering student gets the opportunity to work after completing the bachelor's degree, gets credit for work experience and a legal requirement to be able to complete his education later. A centralization stop. The country must stick together. There is a need for a relocation plan for the welfare programs. We want more teacher and educator training in the province. We will fight against the government closing down production schools. And we will set up four new tax centers with a total of 1,000 new employees. Will the government be involved? The green transition must be maintained ‚Äì not undermined by liberal slowness. Or liberal indifference. Green research must be prioritized. And the next ambitious steps must be taken in connection with the upcoming energy settlement. Now it's not just about producing clean energy. Now the energy must be stored so that we are also sustainable when it is not windy. The energy settlement. It should of course be broad. For the sake of the environment. And for the sake of business. Look ‚Äì if it was a municipal council that had to enter into an energy settlement, then a broad agreement would be a matter of course. The broad collaboration. The will to find solutions. It thrives locally. The Prime Minister sees the young people raising their hands when he visits a high school in Esbjerg. Those who, according to the prime minister, ""seize the opportunities"". Who has ""courage on life"". I know many who have courage in life. But I also know those for whom life is difficult. My vision. Social Democracy's vision. It is conducting politics for both groups. Those who look forward to the future. And those who are concerned. Those who live in the cities. And those who live in the smaller communities. Those who earn a lot. And those who earn little. We want the differences to be smaller. That we unite Denmark. And we do this best in a broad collaboration.

55699.0," The Danes are one of the world's happiest people. This has been the case again and again in headlines in recent years, referring to various international studies. When you take a closer look at the explanations for happiness, they are mainly about the fact that the Danes feel safe to a large extent. We trust each other, and we have a welfare society that ensures each one of us a high degree of security and safety in everyday life. Therefore, it should not surprise anyone that precisely welfare takes up a lot of space in Danish politics. At the moment, you can almost say that it is one of the biggest points of contention at Christiansborg. The government is currently spending an incredible amount of energy talking about other people's attitude to welfare. It's a bit strange all the while that you yourself seem to have a lot of doubts about what you really want. Last week Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was interviewed in connection with the opening of the Parliament, and here she was asked: <U+0094>Should there be more or fewer employees in the public sector?<U+0094>. The answer was: <U+0094>There must be more<U+0094>. But just last week, Helle Thorning-Schmidt's fellow finance minister Bjarne Corydon announced that he will not issue a guarantee that the Danes will get more public servants to deliver welfare with a red government in power. Yes, we must hope that the two top ministers meet this week and find out what S thinks more about the number of people in the public sector who have to provide childcare, education, care for the elderly etc. It is important to ensure the basic welfare. This is of course done primarily through a financially responsible course. It's a bit like home. Here, income and expenditure must also be connected in the long run, otherwise it will end badly. This also means that you must focus on ensuring that the money is used properly. It is common sense, but it is often common sense that gets you the farthest. In the Danish People's Party, we stand firm on the economic policy that we actually agreed with V on until just over a year ago: To keep public real growth at a modest 0.8 percent. It is actually a modest growth. Contrary to what we hear now! Just remember the election campaign in 2011, when S and SF reached out to us because real growth of 0.8 percent was completely insufficient and would lead to cuts in basic welfare. But even if what was a narrow neck in 2011 now almost appears as a pure gift stall, we stand firm. The modest real growth is necessary, i.a. because in the future there will be more elderly people who will of course also need dignified care. And if it's up to us, the hospitals must continue to be able to deliver the best treatments to our sick fellow citizens. This of course requires funds, and in addition to the modest real growth, a better prioritization of the state's, or rather the Danes', money will also be needed to a great extent. For example, less money must be spent on developing country aid, the costs of asylum seekers must be reduced and we must limit the welfare tourism we see from, among other things, Eastern European countries. In return, more money must be spent on the elderly and health. Furthermore, there must be better conditions for the companies so that they stay in Denmark. Get the opportunity to grow and get bigger and hire more people. It provides more tax dollars for our common welfare. Ensuring good conditions for companies also means ensuring a good supply of labour. We have focused on that for a long time. And we like to measure our efforts against, for example, S and SF. Because while the Danish People's Party has since 2001 participated in agreements that have increased the labor supply by almost 240,000, the Social Democrats have only participated in agreements that have increased the labor supply by 130,000. In other words, DF in this area has done almost twice as much as S since 2001. And we continue to ensure the responsible for the benefit of the resources for welfare <U+0096> also d&eacuter where we can influence this government. We saw this, for example, with the growth plan in the spring. We participated <U+0096> d&eacuter where we said no thank you to participate was in relation to the reduction of corporation tax. It simply had too little effect compared to the approx. 4 billion DKK annually, the government would spend on this. That way you can illustrate the difference between the Social Democracy and the Danish People's Party!

54502.0," On the website of the European Social Democrats, it appears from ""Poul's blog"" that the right wing must be countered using an isolation strategy under the motto ""Confront yes, Cooperate no"", and that the European Social Democrats distance themselves from any expression that promotes racism and xenophobia At the same time, Poul Nyrup accuses several member parties in the conservative group in the EU Parliament, EPP, of ""irresponsibility"" - including the chairman of the German party CSU, Horst Seehofer, because he does not want more immigration from Turkey and the Arab countries. So it doesn't take more to end up on Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's hate list. The Danish People's Party is not mentioned at all. We also do not want more immigration from Turkey and the Arab world. I dare say that straight out. We are also considered a party ""on the far right"", if you listen in the EU, where the debate climate is most reminiscent of the Danish one in the 1990s - characterized by platitudes and suffocating political correctness. Ah yes, the 1990s. It was then that the current chairman of the European Social Democrats was chairman of the Danish Social Democrats for a large part of the time - and prime minister from 1993 to 2001. I remember the debate then very well. I remember how poisoned it was. And I remember a Prime Minister who lectured the Danish People's Party from the floor of the Folketing with the words: ""Stuerene, you will never do that"". Poul Nyrup Rasmussen may have regretted the statement for strategic reasons. But no, how he meant it! The words came from the heart, and perhaps in reality we have never experienced Poul Nyrup more honestly than on this particular day. Therefore, it is also strange that the Danish People's Party does not appear on the new <U+0094>hate list<U+0094>. How can it be that we have not been granted any <U+0094>distinguished<U+0094> place in Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's political terror network? Now that the Sweden Democrats and Geert Wilder's Freedom Party are on the list? A little apologetically, Henrik Dam Kristensen tries to answer in a roundabout way with a bit of vague talk that it is a shame that this does not apply to the Danish People's Party. The Social Democrats do not intend to sign any declaration not to cooperate with the Danish People's Party. It just does not harmonize at all with another of the Social Democrats' former chairmen, Mogens Lykketofts, chronicle in Information in February, where he stated in black and white that the Social Democrats must ensure that the Danish People's Party has as little influence as possible. ""We want to be the guarantee that Pia Kj√¶rsgaard is left alone and sullen on the fringes of Danish politics,"" wrote Lykketoft, among other things. Clean words for the money. Mogens Lykketoft subsequently refused to stand up for a debate with me as an opponent - at the very last moment. He had naturally got cold feet. But what the heart is full of, the mouth overflows with. The fanatical hatred of the social democratic top for the Danish People's Party had been revealed once again. The same Mogens Lykketoft also referred to the Sweden Democrats as ""scum"" on TV2-News in connection with the fact that they were elected to the Swedish Riksdag. And isn't it also very striking that Politiken has now tried in vain to get Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's comment several times? But he remains silent as the grave. Have you been caught with your fingers in your pocket? It would suit Poul Nyrup Rasmussen to be a man and come out of the bush. How liberating it would be if Nyrup could find the honesty from 1999 again and speak plainly. However, don't pretend to the voters that this is about random extreme European parties on the political right. Or is it really about the fact that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen does not want to admit that the Danish People's Party is, of course, conservative. Nine finance laws and numerous agreements and settlements as well as major reforms testify to a party that has been willing to take responsibility - and that has managed to cooperate seriously. Is this what Nyrup does not want to admit? That he was completely wrong? It is, of course, about domestic politics and the Social Democratic Party's election campaign. It concerns the Social Democrats' age-old hatred of the Danish People's Party. A hatred which for strategic reasons is tried to be downplayed, but which nevertheless exists in good health. A hatred that really took root when the Nyrup government was overthrown in November 2001 - and when it turned out that the Danish People's Party cooperated constructively and responsibly. I am looking forward to hearing Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's explanation - but conversely I do not have high hopes that I will ever get one - at least not one that is formulated in clear terms. Nyrup's clear speech from 1999 has been silenced - it's a shame because honesty now lasts the longest. And a shame, because the Social Democrats think the voters are fools and put strategy above honesty.

56350.0," When the new Europol legislation goes through, Denmark chooses to withdraw. It is written in black and white in the treaty. It is Denmark itself that wanted it that way. And the best way to ensure that we can continue to participate is to transform the reservation of rights into an optional scheme. Criminal masterminds have had a hard time. In one of the latest Europol operations, various criminal groups were unraveled and prevented from their shady business dealings with, among other things, the smuggling of people and drugs as well as the trafficking of arms. A total of 179 people were arrested and almost three tons of cocaine and 250 kilos of synthetic drugs were seized. Denmark participated in the operation together with the 27 other member states and 11 countries outside the EU. But this kind of cooperation may soon come to an end for Denmark. A new regulation for Europol is currently being negotiated. When it enters into force, Denmark withdraws from the cooperation. I am involved in the negotiations as rapporteur for my political group in the European Parliament, and the ends are about to meet. Soon there will be an agreement in place. The debate in Denmark is that we will be thrown out of the club when the agreement goes through. But let's be absolutely precise here: There is no one who closes the door for us, we close it ourselves. It all depends on our disclaimer. In fact, the treaty states that Denmark does not participate in the Council's adoption of measures proposed pursuant to Part Three, Section V, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The third part, section V of the treaty deals precisely with criminal law and police cooperation. At the same time, it is stated in our reservation of rights that we only participate at intergovernmental level. This means that unanimity between the countries and national implementation is usually required before new legislation can come into force. On the other hand, when it comes to supranational cooperation, a majority in both the European Council and the European Parliament can adopt new legislation. When Denmark has been involved in Europol for so long, it is because Europol has been intergovernmental with the current legislation. But when the new regulation goes through, Europol becomes supranational, and then the Danish reservation of rights kicks in. It is not something that the EU or the other member states have decided. This is a reservation that Denmark itself has taken. And that means we opt out ourselves. Therefore, it also makes no sense when the No side talks about implementing a limited additional selection scheme where only Europol is involved. It is against the treaty and what Denmark has worked for in the past. In certain areas (read: the refugee area) we stand by our rights in relation to the reservation of rights, but in other areas (read: Europol) we want to be involved when it benefits us. Apart from the fact that it doesn't make sense at all, it's also not feasible. It simply doesn't work that way. Several experts have criticized the No side's plans, and now top lawyer Jean Claude Piris is also criticizing them. From 1988 to 2010, he was the head of the Council of Ministers' legal service and is thus completely familiar with treaties and various protocols. Piris is one of the inventors of Denmark's reservation. And he says that the options are simple: Either Denmark participates through an optional model, or we are out: Denmark can choose to participate in the parts of the legal cooperation that it wants. But it must follow the provisions described in the Treaty of Lisbon. Here, the alternative to the Danish legal reservations is an optional scheme. But it requires a full transition to the optional scheme. A middle ground cannot be done. The frames cannot be changed. It will be patently illegal, he says to Berlingske. So regardless of whether the government wanted Denmark to hang on, it is against the treaty and our own reservation. It is not sustainable. Today I am going to Europol in The Hague. Partly to be updated on current topics such as terrorism, cybercrime and migration, but also partly to meet the Danish office and hear more about how the work takes place in everyday life. There are many important questions. And the no side continues to talk about a limited option scheme or a parallel agreement - which could take up to several years to negotiate. The future is therefore uncertain with a no vote, and the no side has not yet explained what they want - i.e. apart from unsafe or downright illegal solutions. When the new Europol legislation goes through, Denmark chooses to withdraw. It is written in black and white in the treaty. It is Denmark itself that has wanted it that way. And the best way to ensure that we can continue to participate is to transform the reservation of rights into an optional scheme. There are not all possible fixed solutions, and one must not fall for the easy-to-buy arguments of the naysayers. It is far too important an area to play politics with.

55743.0," But I wonder if the events of recent days will change that? For new readers, I'd better just give a short resum&eacute of De Radikale's shenanigans. One day, group chairman Christian Friis Bach says to Berlingske: <U+0094>We are going to the election to maintain the 24-year rule in the next election period. I can say that clearly and distinctly<U+0094>. The other day, party chairman Margrethe Vestager wrote on her Facebook page: <U+0094>The Radicals are against the 24-year rule and the affiliation requirements, as we do not think the state should interfere in who you marry. We've always been, so it's hardly anyone's fault. What we go to the polls on and what should be in our leaflets and on our posters, we decide when it becomes relevant<U+0094>. This prompted a journalist from Politiken to write on Twitter: <U+0094>Vestager is 'simply' making it absolutely clear that it is unclear what the party is going to the election on. And that is actually the case in a nutshell. The first announcement, which I have no doubt that Friis-Bach had carefully coordinated with the leadership of his party, came to cover a vulnerable flank for the government. And why? - Yes, because the Danes do not want a lax immigration policy, and the government knows that! No matter how much it probably hurts the eternally good radicals, the Danes will have a sensible policy in this area. And that is why the announcement came now, so that, for example, the 24-year rule does not go away and become an election campaign theme. The problem is just that the group chairman's announcement caused trouble and grumbling in the hinterland, and then the party chairman had to pull ashore again. The status right now seems to be that the Radicals have put themselves between two chairs, and have been dumped between the chairs in the question. Clumsy and unsightly, yes, but the bottom line is that abolishing the 24-year-old rule is radical bloodletting, regardless of what strategic fix-factories come up with. The party holds this ideological banner high, and in that connection cares less about unhappy young girls and boys being forced into marriages with someone they cannot stand. A cruel fate for many - as De Radikale opens up here. There is such a twist that if it seems that abolishing the 24-year rule stands in the way of radical ministerial positions, then you start with the ministerial positions - and then we know Vestager enough to know that she will probably get her the will of the Social Democrats, who are just as keen to become ministers. The conclusion is that, should the unfortunate thing happen, that the government continues after the next election, I have not the slightest doubt that Vestager will probably again, as has happened more than a dozen times since 2011, have to ""persuade"" the Social Democrats to to make right. In addition, the media has covered the whole case somewhat strangely. It has been suggested several times that the Radicals should suddenly go to the polls on a fixed immigration policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. After all, the 24-year rule is just a small part of the area, and the government has made one relaxation after another during its now three-year lifespan. The start-up aid has been abolished. The point system has been abolished. Asylum seekers can live and work outside the asylum centres. The rules for family reunification have been relaxed. And so on and so on. Alas, yes... If there is anything to be learned from the radical fic-flack of recent days, it is that the S-R are by no means finished with relaxing the immigration policy. They are only just getting started. So, dear friends: Don't believe them - the others, when they start playing ""strategy"" with immigration policy. It is abracadabra and rhetoric.

54421.0," When the Islamic population grows in a Western country, the ills of the Islamic world automatically follow. That is why it is crucial that Denmark stands firm with France and Austria when they now deal with Islamic attacks against freedom of expression and the Western way of life in Europe. There are still pockets of resistance from the 1990s that cannot see the problems with immigration from Stormellem√∏sten. This was most recently exhibited in the daily newspaper Politiken, where 21 prominent researchers, of whom almost no one has heard, argued against the government's initiatives to prevent anti-social behaviour. But otherwise, the seriousness has gradually dawned on most people. The 47 countries that have an Islamic majority - and especially those that have an Islamic constitution - are among the worst in the world in a number of important dimensions when you consider them together. This information can be found collected in Ruud Koopmans' new book Islam's dilapidated house, which is hereby highly recommended. To get the full overview, you should read the entire book. But I can mention that the countries taken together are the least democratic and least free. Just as I can mention that the countries taken together are the ones that give women and religious and sexual minorities the worst treatment. When the Islamic population grows in a Western country, the ills of the Islamic world automatically follow. The persecution of minorities and the poor treatment of women is increasing. So does the fight against democracy ‚Äì just like the fight against ordinary, civilized norms of behavior. One can hardly bear to write that there are exceptions. But of course there is. The problem is just that there is far, far too little resistance from within. That there are far, far too few people with a middle-class background who, on the inner lines, say no to the many evils that the culture brings with it. However, I believe that changes are on the way. That French President Macron and Austrian Chancellor Kurz have had enough of the Islamic attacks on freedom of expression and the Western way of life seems credible after the latest wave of terror. But the question is: When it comes down to it, do the two heads of state have the necessary power to turn the tide? These are not entirely small obstacles that must be cleared on the way forward towards a reconstruction of civil rights and the modern, secular way of life in Europe. First, Europe's external borders must be effectively closed. Macron has made that clear a long time ago. But can he persuade Germany and Germany's extended arm ‚Äì the European Commission ‚Äì to do so? Until now, the country has shone with a completely worldly and precisely 1990s-like understanding of the problems. Macron and Kurz are probably right in their analyses. But can they be right? This is the big question that must be answered in the coming time. Second, foreign states must stop interfering in the internal affairs of European countries. Here again, it is Macron who takes the lead with his showdown with Turkey and not least the country's directorate for religious affairs, the Diyanet. The demand for an end to interference goes much further. But by virtue of the large group of people in Europe who have a Turkish background, he has of course started in a sensible place. But does Macron dare to carry out his showdown with Turkey? Which probably ends up touching on very central matters such as the country's membership of NATO and the cooperation agreement between the then EC and Turkey, which goes all the way back to 1963? And of course there will also be consequences for the agreement that the EU entered into with the country in 2015 regarding refugees. The recapture of full freedom of expression throughout Europe stands and falls with Macron and Kurz holding firm. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that Denmark provides the two countries with the necessary moral and political support. Comment published in Berlingske on 15 November 2020.

55100.0," But then <U+0096> 20 years ago <U+0096> the Progress Party was in chaos. We had to figure out what was going to happen. After twisting and turning the situation, we decided that the only right thing to do was to form a new party. The vast majority of opinion makers did not think we had any chance of success. But thank God it was different with many Danes. Those who had to believe it did! Wednesday evening, 4 October 1995 <U+0096> a few days after a stormy national meeting in the Progress Party - we met at Pia Kj√¶rsgaard's. We had to decide what to do next. When we agreed that we should work to establish the new party, we had to try to come up with a good name. An A4 sheet was filled with all sorts of ideas. Proposals such as <U+0094>The Moderates<U+0094>, <U+0094>The Right<U+0094> and <U+0094>The People's Party<U+0094> and many more were noted. Afterwards, we crossed out the ones we didn't like. What remained was the name Dansk Folkeparti. We thought that was just right! Until the press conference two days later, I practiced and practiced saying the new name: Danish People's Party. Yes, even in the shower it sounded: <U+0094>Danish People's Party<U+0094>, <U+0094>Danish People's Party, <U+0094>Danish People's Party<U+0094>. It was important that it was right in the cupboard at the press conference! It did! And although most people at Borgen still ruled us out, we could feel great support from many Danes. We collected signatures in a particularly cold winter. But it went fast. Many wanted to help, and in April 1996 the signatures were handed in and we became eligible to stand. I think we felt like the entrepreneurs who have tried to start a business. It might be tiring, but it's so fun and exciting that you hardly notice it. And that is how it has actually been for most of the past 20 years. The fact that it is just this year that the party turns 20 is fantastic. It's like everything is falling into place this year. We have had a completely sovereign general election. 21.1 per cent of the votes and 37 mandates in the Folketing. We now have over 17,000 members, and activity in our local associations is growing like never before. And our chairman for 17 of the 20 years has been elected as chairman of the Danish Parliament. Yes <U+0096> that's actually ok. Here in 2015, the Danish People's Party has become the people's party that we hoped for back in 1995! We have left our mark on things over the years. In the 90s, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen brought in the popular √Örhus mayor Thorkild Simonsen as minister to give us a counterpoint to the immigration debate. Nyrup himself tried with the well-known: <U+0094>You will never stay in the living room<U+0094>. The referendum on the crown in September 2000, which we and Denmark won. The role as a support party up through the 00s, where we got better and better at securing influence. There is a lot to think back on! But life is not lived backwards. We should be happy with what we have achieved. But the goal for us is that the Danish People's Party is a party that has an influence on Denmark's development over a long period of time. Only in this way can we ensure that Danish values ‚Äã‚Äãare upheld. That the Denmark we have been handed down from the generations before us is passed on in respect for just that! That the country which has ensured security and stability for so many Danes can also do so in the future <U+0096> despite a world that is becoming more and more unpredictable and insecure. Therefore: Sure, 20 years is a long time <U+0096> but in a way we've only just begun! Migrants through Europe. The EU's attempt to control more and more. There is plenty to do! Tomorrow, the Folketing opens for a new parliamentary year. It is a day of celebration. The royal family attends. It will be beautiful. And then we have a birthday. Shouldn't we have layer cake? Even if we got a bit of a jumpstart on the festivities in connection with our annual meeting in Herning, where 1658 participated. What a party! Many thanks to all of you who participated. But regardless of whether you were in Herning, whether you are a member of the Danish People's Party, whether you voted for us in June. A great many Danes have helped us along the way over the past 20 years. Many thanks to each and every one. It has all contributed to the fact that we have come here now and have the opportunity to influence the course for Denmark. And if anyone would like to get ahead of the birthday tomorrow, DR1 will broadcast tonight at 20.00 the program <U+0094>20 years with the Danish People's Party<U+0094>. A portrait about DF.

54181.0," Last week, a group of niqab-clad people visited Borgen. On arrival, a bunch of red MFs stood cheering, chirping and smiling ready with welcoming arms. And each of them ‚Äì Mette Gjerskov (S), Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen (Enh), Josephine Fock (√Ö) ‚Äì was, almost drooling with dialogue, absolutely crazy about taking selfies with the black ghosts, because where was it all exciting. And to what extent did they ""distance themselves from the right wing"", as each of the MFs assured the public. Yes, and I have to promise that they did it. And how happy I was to be thus kept at a long, long distance from this knee-jerk knee-jerk reaction to Salafism in its purest form, the niqab. I return to Salafism. Before then, I just want to give myself time to express dismay at the direction the socialists and the so-called red-greens have taken over the past decades, when it comes to their previous struggles for equality between the sexes - and against the oppression of women. I am old enough to remember how a large group of red feminists in Aalborg stood shouting and gesticulating in front of a meeting of the Aalborg Housewives Association. The pious, edifying topic for the housewives that evening was: ""This is how you butcher a pig"". It was not the subject that had brought the feminists into a frenzy - but only the fact that they found the country's housewives' associations deeply offensive; because there lived the clear proof of how the man had indirectly succeeded in keeping his woman submissive in a lowly psychological captivity - all with the help of sophisticated, deadly weapons such as: ""Learn to crochet"", ""Keep your kitchen in order"" , ""Get ready for pickle season"". With the 70s and 80s, the outrageous housewives associations slowly languished under the pressure, and thus the topless feminists on Fem√∏, by the campfire over a pipe of tobacco, could laughingly note another significant victory. Today's feminists have not yet won against the niqab or burqa women. Possibly for the reason that the feminists have not so much as lifted a finger for them. The feminists have done just as little for all the thousands of other Muslim sisters who are oppressed daily in the most degrading way. Here it's not ""Keep your kitchen in order"" or ""Learn to crochet"", it's about - no, here it's an unappetizing quagmire of honor and shame that even little girls stick to. But today's feminists look the other way - and instead concentrate on completely harmless issues such as equal pay and maternity leave, and - well, how they rumble! And even when niqab women walk our streets and alleys - that is, Salafists - there are still no feminists at home. It is possible that you don't ""like it"", as is expressed by the very bravest like Mette, Johanne and Josephine, but you find it more important to get selfies taken and to ""seek the dialogue"". Um... just a moment: ""Seeking the dialogue?""... With Salafists! Have they eaten nails? Do the three MFs even know what this is about? Here is time for some information about Salafism, which currently houses, among other things, the Islamic State and Al Queda. The Salafism which, among other things, with Danish passports has sent heaps of men and women off to Syria and Iraq to join our enemies. Salafism therefore also has a more peaceful everyday life in Denmark - although the disgusting smell of the Islamic State and Al Queda is still unmistakable. And it was the denomination that made its entrance at the Castle last week. Salafists ‚Äì men and women ‚Äì are Muslims who want a return to the original Islam from Muhammad's time in Medina. Salafism is well over 100 years old and has an outward expression in the men's long, white robes, long beards and headdresses. The women wear a black niqab. They all want the Caliphate and they all want Sharia Law. Each and every one of them despises Danish tradition and way of life. Each and every one of them despises and spits on Western civilization. Each and every one of them despises our people's government and democracy. Each and every one has opted out of Danish society - apart from their magnificent acceptance of receiving all Danish rights - including, of course, not least cash assistance... And then, believe me!, they babble endlessly about dialogue, about freedom, about tolerance, about peace, about respect for all religions, about the immense freedom of Salafist women. But note: Salafists are per definition full of hoaxes. Lying to us Gentiles is their hallmark. Behind closed doors ‚Äì in the nice apartments they have been gifted by Danish taxpayers ‚Äì they sit and laugh at us. We gullible, tolerant fools... And last week they laughed most of all at Mette Gjerskov, at Josephine Fock and at Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen - and not least at all their funny selfies...

83599.0," In his letter to the members of the German Bundestag dated February 23, 2012, Federal Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble speaks of 35 billion euros, which will be added to the 130 billion to secure the European Central Bank to be added. If that is true, then the Bundestag will vote on an additional 165 billion for Greece on Monday, Sahra Wagenknecht comments on Wolfgang Sch√§uble's letter, which was enclosed with the documents on the Greece package. The first deputy chairwoman of the DIE LINKE parliamentary group continued: The risks cannot be calculated, because it is completely open whether the 35 billion to protect the European Central Bank only have to be granted in the short term. The Greek government has created the basis to legally force private creditors to participate in the bond swap. In this case, it is likely that Greece will receive a default or partial default rating for the foreseeable future and the ‚Ç¨35 billion credit facility will remain activated as per the agreement. The probability of such a rating also increases due to the fact that the national debt ratio will not decrease as a result of creditor participation. Even the base scenario of the International Monetary Fund assumes this. THE LEFT will not agree to the new 165 billion bank rescue package. Not a cent of this reaches the Greek population and Greece's insolvency cannot be stopped. The German taxpayer alone will bear a three-digit billion-dollar risk in the event of a later insolvency, while banks and private creditors will have secured their money with the help of the federal government.  The fact that Federal Finance Minister Sch√§uble, even before the vote in the Bundestag on the second Greece package, is juggling billions more, for which the taxpayer will have to pay, shows that the aid to Greece is neither seriously calculated nor will it fulfill its alleged purpose.""

82080.0," The Chancellor is the Pinocchio of the euro crisis. She is the puppet of the banks and is lying to the public about the haircut, Sahra Wagenknecht comments on the admission by J√∂rg Rocholl, member of the scientific advisory board of the Federal Ministry of Finance, that Greece needs another haircut, as well as the debate about dissolving the Troika. The first deputy chairwoman of the DIE LINKE parliamentary group and the top candidate in North Rhine-Westphalia continued: The federal government delayed a hard haircut for Greece in order to buy out banks and hedge funds with public money. The necessary haircut now mainly affects taxpayers and no longer private creditors. However, Angela Merkel does not want to present the bill until after the elections. Of the 207 billion euros in loan aid, around 195 billion euros, or almost 95 percent, flowed to the financial sector through repayments, interest and recapitalization of banks. The Greek economy has been in recession for half a decade because of the Troika's austerity dictates. The debt ratio has risen from 130 percent to almost 180 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). A dissolution of the Troika would therefore be desirable. But the expulsion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Europe, as demanded by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, does not mean the end of the devastating Troika policy. The IMF at least had the more realistic analysis when it came to debt haircuts. It is also a bad joke when Reding thinks that the EU Commission has a better sense of social balance than the IMF. At around 14 trillion euros, the wealth of European millionaires now exceeds the total national debt of all EU states, which amounts to around 11 trillion euros, and continues to grow unchecked. It is therefore crucial that bank rescue and austerity policies are stopped immediately and millions in assets are finally skimmed off. Europe needs development programs instead of trillions for zombie banks. Owners and creditors should be liable for partial insolvency of banks and a hard haircut. In addition, DIE LINKE is calling for low-interest direct loans from the European Central Bank and a wealth levy for millionaires.

67335.0," Regarding the considerations within the grand coalition to transfer unused places in the quota of 1,000 people per month for family reunification of those entitled to subsidiary protection from 2018 to 2019, the chairman of the Af D- Group in the German Bundestag, Alexander Gauland, said: ‚ÄúOnce again, the SPD is pursuing a policy regarding family reunification that is not in the interest of the German population. While the number of deportations continues to decline, the SPD is bargaining at every opportunity to bring even more refugees to Germany. But citizens in Germany don't want more refugees, they want fewer refugees. In addition, those entitled to subsidiary protection are not refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Refugee Convention, but rather people who must return to their home countries immediately after the reason for protection no longer applies. Family reunification must happen there and not in Germany. Therefore, family reunification for this group of people makes no sense and ultimately only makes it more difficult for them to leave the country. But perhaps that is exactly what the SPD wants to achieve. The fact that Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is open to the SPD's demands for family reunification makes it clear once again that his announcements of a consistent asylum policy are nothing more than lip service.""

67468.0," At the closing ceremony of the #Seehofer Wegbassen demo in the Berlin club Mensch Meier, six police officers were attacked with irritant gas yesterday. AfD Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Petr Bystron said: ‚ÄúThe latest incident is further proof that the so-called 'refugee councils' are disregarding our constitutional state. For years, these groups have been helping rejected asylum seekers resist legal deportations. Now their rejection of our constitutional state is even manifesting itself in violence against police officers. The leaders of these NGOs are largely radical left-wing extremists who want to abolish the nation state, disregard the rule of law and encourage others to break the law. In this respect, this attack on police officers is only a logical consequence of their previous anti-state activities. They are enemies of our state and our free society, but they have appropriated the state's institutions and financing options in order to take action against it. It is absurd enough that Federal Interior Minister Seehofer is financing the ‚ÄúSeebr√ºcke‚Äù demonstrations against himself ‚Äì now he is also financing violence against police officers on duty. As one of my short inquiries on this topic last year revealed, the federal government finances various pro-migration NGOs with over 100 million euros annually. These include many NGOs that support asylum seekers within the country to avoid legal deportation notices. There are also those who operate ships in the Mediterranean for the purpose of smuggling migrants into Europe.

72869.0," <U+200B>BERLIN. In view of the ever-new information on the cooperation between German and friendly intelligence services, the FDP internal affairs expert and chairman of the Interior & Law working group of the FDP parliamentary group and FDP chairman in the parliamentary control committee, Hartfrid WOLFF, explains: <U+200B> The control of the German secret services must be sustainable be improved. The Bundestag must be given significantly expanded control powers. The members of the Parliamentary Control Committee are currently dependent on the information that the intelligence services give them voluntarily. So far, not least the SPD has blocked the FDP's reform proposals. ¬† For more effective control, the PKGr needs a permanent representative in order to be able to exercise more direct control on a regular basis. The PKGr must also be given the right to listen to secret service employees without involving their superiors and to approve in advance the service's instructions, e.g. regarding the use of intelligence resources. Statements made by the services in the control committee must be recorded; incomplete or incorrect statements must have consequences under civil service law. The FDP parliamentary group had already presented this and other suggestions in a draft law in February 2013.  ¬† Unlike the SPD, which ultimately even passed an unconstitutional law on data storage during its time in government, the FDP always guarantees that the balancing between security interests and the protection of fundamental rights is not done carelessly at the expense of civil liberties.  ¬† It is unbearable how essential freedoms are clearly being trampled on. The people's representatives must be given more opportunities to uncover these violations.

68462.0,"According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, exactly two illegal immigrants were banned from crossing the border last week due to the order of Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer. The AfD parliamentary group leader in the German Bundestag, Alice Weidel, thinks this is a farce: ‚ÄúHundreds of thousands of migrants are currently staying in Germany illegally, an estimated 500 more illegal immigrants cross German borders every day with the word 'asylum' on their lips, two of them Horst Seehofer had it rejected in a week. The Federal Minister of the Interior obviously wants to play the citizens for fools if he celebrates this as a success. These figures from the Ministry of the Interior are nothing more than an admission that the Seehofer decree, in its limitation to a narrow group of illegal immigrants, is merely typical CSU alibi politics that does not even scratch the surface of everyday violations of the law at the German borders. Reapplying current law means preventing all illegal border crossings. This also includes all those migrants who come without valid papers or via a safe third country and therefore cannot claim asylum in Germany. As long as Seehofer does not implement this and completely revoke the disastrous decree of his predecessor Thomas de Maizi√®re from autumn 2015, no one can take the CSU theater thunder in the asylum dispute seriously.‚Äù",no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes established parties but does not claim state institutions inherently favor a certain group.

69876.0," The FDP federal chairman CHRISTIAN LINDNER gave ‚ÄúSpiegel Online‚Äù the following interview. SEVERIN WEILAND and SEBASTIAN FISCHER asked the questions: Question: Mr. Lindner, the federal FDP is polling between five and seven percent. In the spring they had success in two West German countries, but in all likelihood they won't be able to get into Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Sunday. Does that frustrate you? LINDNER: The FDP has made gains in five elections in a row. Who would have thought that was possible in 2013? Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is a difficult place for us. But 22 percent of people there can now imagine voting for the FDP. We are recruiting these people until the polling stations close so that there is a voice for market economy and liberality in the state parliament. Question: You sharply differentiated the FDP from the AfD early on. Were you afraid that your party might also flirt with right-wing populism after the disaster in the 2013 federal election? LINDNER: No, we are a liberal force that trusts in the individual and loves diversity. The Af D wants to speak for a supposedly racially homogeneous people, ideally with one voice - that is authoritarian politics in the style of Erdogan or Putin. The FDP is the sharpest contrast to this. Question: Given the success of the AfD and the decline of the major parties, the FDP could very quickly come into question as a coalition partner if it were to enter the Bundestag. Are you prepared for this? LINDNER: I think about a lot of things, but not about coalitions. We want to score points with our projects. World's best education including reform of small-scale education federalism. A market economy renewal that reduces bureaucracy for small and medium-sized businesses and trades, but enforces clear rules for banks and Silicon Valley companies. A state capable of acting, but which does not continually encroach on civil rights. Question: And what about the tax policy with which you failed in the black and yellow coalition because of Angela Merkel? LINDNER: That remains a focus. Because it is precisely because we have failed because of the Union that the task is even more urgent. We are currently updating our tax policy concept. I believe an annual relief of up to 30 billion is possible by the end of the decade - of 100 billion that the state will receive in addition. There has been no relief for ten years; instead, the grand coalition increased social security contributions. It is completely unacceptable that a family from the middle of society has no chance of achieving a similar level of prosperity as their parents because the state intervenes so heavily. Issues are more important than coalition tactics. Question: So would you rather be in opposition? LINDNER: We are ready to take responsibility. But if you can't set liberal accents in the government, then we'd rather go into opposition to present liberal arguments. The FDP will not govern at any price. Question: The possible entry of the Af D will make it more difficult to form a government after 2017. LINDNER: The surveys show one thing: AfD voters paradoxically strengthen Angela Merkel. Because with every vote for the AfD, the likelihood of a continuation of the grand coalition increases. And that's exactly what suits Mrs. Merkel because she can avoid a decision for a new alliance. The grand coalition is a comfortable way to carry on. Question: In Rhineland-Palatinate, the FDP has formed a traffic light coalition with the SPD and the Greens. Would that be a role model? LINDNER: No, my imagination isn't enough for that. We governed successfully with the SPD in Rhineland-Palatinate until 2006. In the federal government, the Red and Green declare the TTIP free trade agreement dead, even though it hasn't even been negotiated yet, both want more state, both are against a rational energy policy - no, that doesn't fit. Question: Then you only have the CDU/CSU. LINDNER: The crux of the matter is that the Union has been gutted in terms of content. Where are the differences between the Union, the Greens and the SPD in economic, social and European policy? Today the CDU is largely a social democratic party. Question: Merkel has slowed down her tax reduction plans in the black and yellow coalition. What did you learn from it? LINDNER: That we have no natural allies. When Ms. Merkel cleared the tax reform, we should have said: Chancellor, the coalition is over or we will renegotiate. Instead, we ‚Äì including me ‚Äì remained silent. That cost us a lot of credibility. Question: The Federal Assembly will elect a new Federal President in the spring. Your party has around 30 electors. Which candidate do you want? LINDNER: A personality who ensures that Germany maintains its composure in these turbulent times and who embodies our liberality - not in a party political sense. Question: Does it have to be a politician? LINDNER: No, but it can be one. Question: Are there already discussions? LINDNER: Every now and then we talk between the party leaders. At the moment, the Greens in particular are behaving tactically because they don't want to mess with either the CDU or the SPD, their potential coalition partners. Question: Merkel recently met with the Prime Minister of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Winfried Kretschmann. Would the Green be someone the FDP would vote for? LINDNER: Mr. Kretschmann has raised doubts about his integrity. The Greens complain about a lack of transparency in TTIP, while Mr. Kretschmann makes secret side agreements with the CDU. By the way, there are also tax increases for families who want to buy their own home. The pillar saint Kretschmann has become a hypocrite. Question: What speaks against a camp election campaign in the Federal Assembly? LINDNER: Are there still camps? Party affiliation is of secondary importance to us. Why doesn't the SPD suggest Gerhard Schr√∂der? Question: You asked the former chancellor? LINDNER: Yes, but just for fun. Question: Isn't it time for a female federal president? LINDNER: Since we have been governed by a female chancellor for over ten years, the gender issue has been properly resolved. It doesn't have to be a Protestant theology professor from East Germany. Because of me, there will probably be a charismatic business leader one day. Question: A year ago, Mrs. Merkel and the Austrian Chancellor opened the borders and the influx of refugees began. You criticized Ms. Merkel for this. What is your balance today? LINDNER: The essential questions have not been resolved - with the refugee deal, Ms. Merkel has made us dependent on Erdogan. I am ashamed of the federal government's egg dance on the Armenia resolution. Instead, we need a Plan B for protecting our external borders. Question: What are you thinking about? LINDNER: I imagine an EU border police. There is no return of rejected asylum seekers to North Africa, so I expect more robustness in the discussions - if necessary with the point that development cooperation cannot be taken for granted. There is still no immigration law that distinguishes between temporary protection for refugees and permanent residence for selected immigrants. Question: Was Merkel naive? LINDNER: I don't want to enter into a competition of insults. Mrs. Merkel made serious mistakes. A policy of borderless admission is ultimately irresponsible and anti-social because it accepts centrifugal forces in European societies and has made agreement in the EU more difficult. The European states must continue to be able to decide who they invite to shape their future with them and with whom they temporarily show solidarity. Germany cannot dictate its ethical motives to Europe. ",yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,"partisan_state_label: The text accuses a state minister of partisan abuse of office against a political opponent.

The country is still hopelessly over-indebted. It is only a matter of time before the next 'rescue package' after the supposed last one is due. The creditors will probably not see the 289 billion in bailout money that has flowed so far either again in the foreseeable future. Extending the repayment until St. Nicholas Day is an accounting trick to disguise the fact that Germany and the other donor countries have thrown good taxpayer money after bad into a bottomless pit. There is only one way out of the downward spiral for Greece: exiting the euro. The stubbornness of the Euro leaders, who are keeping the country at all costs in a currency that does not correspond to its own economic strength, is costing the citizens of Germany and Greece dearly.""

69111.0,"The request submitted today by the Af D parliamentary group in the Petitions Committee to convene a public committee meeting at the earliest possible date on December 10, 2018 on the occasion of the quorum achieved for the petition on the migration pact was rejected by all other parliamentary groups in the German Bundestag without debate. Johannes Huber, chairman of the AfD in the Petitions Committee, expresses sharp criticism: ‚ÄúSince an appointment before the adoption of the migration pact by the federal government would have been possible, it fills me with deep incomprehension that this is not happening. The quorum has already been reached for days and it would have been reached sooner if the Bundestag's IT was not in this poor condition. Here it was negligently neglected to upgrade accordingly, especially since this problem has been known for a long time. The lack of treatment before the adoption of the migration pact corresponds to a completely removed understanding of democracy on the part of the political class. When it is heard from the ranks of the Greens in the committee that the petitions are 'filth', this speaks volumes about their approach to the constitution and their derogatory view of the citizen.

It couldn't be more outrageous or absurd. One could almost laugh at this bizarre story if this fraudulent arsonist hadn't put 170 people's lives in danger and caused millions in damage. Such terrible events show what kind of people mingle with the asylum seekers: dangerous criminals without conscience. But it also shows that the authorities still do not have the asylum crisis under control. They usually don't even know who lives in the asylum seekers' homes because they have lost control. This is extremely dangerous in the truest sense of the word.

84890.0," Apparently the Federal Finance Minister no longer even dares to debate with his own parliamentary group about the specific design of the euro rescue package. The federal government's crisis policy has failed. The support within one's own ranks for further 'merchandising' is crumbling, explains Sahra Wagenknecht in response to the accusation from some Union politicians that Federal Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble (CDU) withheld a finished working draft of the euro rescue package from them. The economic policy spokeswoman for DIE LINKE continued: Not a single cause of the financial and debt crisis will be eliminated by the upgraded financial stability facility (European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF). The maintenance of this bank rescue monster will cost taxpayers dearly. Even before the German Bundestag approved the resolutions of the last euro crisis summit, it was clear that this was just a costly purchase of time. The bourgeois camp has no overall concept for solving the crisis. THE LEFT demands that public budgets be immediately freed from their dependence on the capital markets. To do this, states must be given the opportunity to take out low-interest loans from the ECB through a European bank for public bonds. At the same time, the level of debt must be drastically reduced through the participation of banks and private creditors, as well as through a Europe-wide wealth tax for millionaires.

If the SPD and parts of the CDU prove to be able to learn, that is fundamentally to be welcomed Because the voters are running away from them, the AfD's demand ""Immigration needs clear rules"" with explicit reference to Canada is condemned as ""populist"" or even ""xenophobic"". The same thing happens when processing asylum procedures the deportation of asylum seekers who have been legally rejected. Improvements should finally be made here too. As a member of the immigration commission set up under the red-green coalition, I supported the Canadian points system. This is where the country chooses its immigrants and not the other way around like we do! The AfD works!

160176.0," After years of redundancies and attempts to downgrade hard won terms and conditions, the announcement by aerospace firm Bombardier‚Äôs global bosses of their intention to sell their operations in Northern Ireland and Morocco creates further uncertainty and concern for workers and their families.Bombardier accounts for almost 5% of the entire labour force of Northern Ireland and 10% of manufacturing GDP. ¬†The remaining 3,600 jobs are a drastically reduced figure, less than half of what it was in the 1990s, with thousands of jobs lost in the last three years alone through multiple redundancy announcements.A fortnight after the announcement of sale, Unite trade union representatives in Bombardier, supported by others in the aerospace sector, moved an emergency motion at the union‚Äôs regional conference: ‚ÄúThis conference confirms that our union will do whatever it takes to defend jobs and skills at Bombardier‚Ä¶ We will continue to raise the idea and fight for the re-nationalisation of this company if that‚Äôs the only way to protect our members and defend local communities. ¬†We will do whatever it takes to prevent a ‚Äòvulture‚Äô company swooping in to pick while leaving the rest to waste. As a trade union our priority is jobs, skills and communities.‚Äù This motion won unanimous support.Calls for government action to save jobs have been raised by workers at British Steel, where thousands of direct and supply chain jobs are threatened.

114785.0," Speaking in Dail on Bretton Woods Amdt BillThe first thing on the to-do list of the incoming government after the imminent election is to re-open the EU-IMF deal to secure less onerous, but more achievable terms.In the election, the Labour Party will be seeking a mandate from the people to re-open the deal so as to give Ireland as strong a negotiating position as possible.It is quite clear that the government, distracted by internecine conflict, took its eye off the ball in its dealings with the IMF. Rather than lead the negotiations himself, Brian Lenihan handed authority over to his civil servants.But it was Brian Lenihan himself who signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the dotted line. He will never be able to shirk his responsibility for allowing a hopelessly inadequate deal to be negotiated for Ireland in his name.We are to make penalty payments of up to 300 basis points, or 3%, on all monies drawn down under the agreement. Despite initial insistence that the terms of the deal were set in stone, the Minister finally suggested in recent days that the interest rate could after all be reduced. In the cold light of day, he recognises himself that it is a bad deal.Whether the task falls to Brian Lenihan or to his successor, negotiating down the interest rate will be a delicate and difficult matter, but one of the utmost importance.If the penalty payment margin were to be halved to 150 basis points, this would bring down our annual interest payments by a billion euro in cash terms by 2014.Another major area for discussion must be the extent of burden sharing between taxpayers and bank bondholders. Chancellor Merkel made the common sense observation that investors who take a risk should not be given complete cover by sovereign governments.However, her approach seems to be that of St. Augustine: 'make me chaste, but not yet'. She and other EU leaders have not yet accepted that part of the solution to the current banking and economic crises, never mind the next one, is appropriate burden sharing between taxpayers and investors.We must do everything within our power to mend the damaged perceptions of Ireland abroad. We are a proud nation facing challenging times, but they are challenges we will overcome to thrive again.We are blessed with bountiful natural resources, a proud cultural heritage and a workforce that is hard-work, well educated, entrepreneurial and English speaking.Ireland is the only English speaking member of the Eurozone, and we have a competitve business-friendly tax regime that leaves us well placed to remain one of the most attractive destinations for inward investment in the Western world.With the right policies and the right leadership, we will again be prosperous, confident and ready to place our part as conscientious global citizens.

It is ironic that theEuropean Commission is calling for more transparency around tax rulings whileat the same time simply unveiling a package which has existed since the 1970¬¥s.‚ÄúThis is aclear attempt to dupe the public into believing that the EU are being proactivein relation to this matter, when in fact there has been an obligation on MemberStates since 1977 grounded in Council Directive 77/799 to exchange spontaneousinformation on contentious tax rulings which was reaffirmed in an updatedCouncil directive in 2011 and only recently amended by Directive 2014/107/EUwhich came into force on January 5th 2015.‚ÄúIn fact,only last month I submitted a question to the European Commission asking aboutthe Irish Government's compliance with this 1977 directive and subsequentamending Directives. ¬†I am awaiting aresponse.‚ÄúIt goeswithout saying that there needs to be concrete measures put in place in orderto move towards an EU and indeed a global tax transparency.‚ÄúHowever,these must be authentic actions and not merely an exercise in cosmetics.‚ÄúTax evasionand cross-border tax fraud is a major concern for many parties, including SinnFein, as untaxed income is considerably reducing our national tax revenues. ¬†As Ireland tries to find a sustainableeconomic recovery we must develop a healthier reputation as a transparent placeto pay tax and face up to any changes necessary to create transparent globaltax system where multinationals cannot escape their duties to countriesincluding developing countries.Carthy, whois a member of the European Parliament's Economic & Monetary AffairsCommittee, further stated:‚ÄúThere is no party more committedto protecting Irish tax sovereignty than Sinn F√©in. In my role on the Economicand Monetary Committee in the European Parliament, I am seeking to ensure thatthe interests of the Irish people are placed at the forefront of any economicpolicy. ¬†‚ÄúHowever, direct taxation is amatter of national competency and the EU has no role in dictating orinterfering with Irish Taxation Policies. ¬†It does not serve the interests of theordinary Irish citizen to have our sovereignty surrendered or relinquished.‚ÄúNevertheless, advocating forstrong tax transparency measures does not interfere with Irish sovereignty.

118564.0," Meath East TD Dominic Hannigan has said that the Seanad as an institution is rotten beyond reform, stating that we need to shut it down and move on.Speaking in the D√°il on the Abolition of the Seanad Bill today, the Labour Deputy and former Senator said ‚ÄòTwitter is the Seanad of the people‚Äô.‚ÄúI have seen the Seanad operate on good days and bad days.‚ÄúI was present for the debate of Civil Partnership, for the Bank Guarantee, for NAMA legislation, when voices from the Seanad raised issues that had not been considered by the main house, put down amendments and helped improve legislation.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôve also been there on farcical occasions when business was stopped to allow golf matches take place and for debates around claims for expenses by members which were suspect to say the least.‚Äù‚ÄúI ask if sufficient good is being done in the Seanad to justify its continued existence.‚ÄúI have no doubt that the current crop of Senators are decent, well-meaning national servants but the institution they serve is rotten, rotten beyond reform.‚ÄúNone of the 12 proposals to reform the Seanad made since 1937 have happened and talk of extending the franchise to all university graduates is still elitist.‚ÄúMeanwhile, talk of extending the Seanad role to give it more oversight on certain issues is work that could be done by D√°il committees.‚ÄúPeople talk about holding the Government to account but that is being done elsewhere, in the media and on social media.

108624.0," A Cheann Comhairle,    I wish to inform the House that the President, acting on my advice, has accepted the resignations of Deputy Pat Rabbitte, Deputy Ruairi Quinn, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, Deputy Phil Hogan and Deputy Jimmy Deenihan as members of the Government.I move that Dail Eireann approves the nominations by the Taoiseach of Deputy Paschal Donohoe, Deputy Heather Humphreys, Deputy Alan Kelly, Deputy Jan O‚ÄôSullivan and Deputy Alex White for appointment by the President as members of the Government.I also wish to inform the House that I am nominating Deputy Phil Hogan as Ireland‚Äôs next member of the European Commission.I intend to nominate Deputy Jed Nash for appointment as Minister of State attending the Government and Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with responsibility for Business and Employment.I confirm to the House that Deputy Paul Kehoe will continue to attend Government as Minister of State and my Department and at the Department of Defence and Government Chief Whip.I also intend to propose to the Government the appointment of Deputy Jimmy Deenihan as Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for the Irish abroad.Further appointments of ministers of state will be made by the Government in the near future.I intend to assign the following responsibilities to the members of GovernmentDepartment of Defence to Deputy Simon Coveney, in addition to his current responsibilities.Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to Deputy Paschal Donohoe.Department of Education and Skills to Deputy Jan O‚ÄôSullivan.Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to Deputy Alex White.Department of Foreign Affairs to Deputy Charlie Flanagan.Department of the Environment and Local Government to Deputy Alan Kelly.Department of Children and Youth Affairs to Deputy James Reilly.Department of Health to Deputy Leo Varadkar, andDepartment of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht to Deputy Heather Humphreys.A Cheann Comhairle, I‚Äôd like to thank the outgoing members of the Cabinet for their service during what have been difficult times for our country. Individually and collectively, these Ministers have played a major part in creating those all-important jobs for our people and in securing Ireland‚Äôs economic recovery.I have already publically and deeply thanked the former T√°naiste Eamon Gilmore. As Tanaiste, over the last three years, he has been outstanding in the service of Ireland and the Irish people. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he has been central to restoring Ireland‚Äôs international reputation. A restoration that has been vital for generating investor confidence and creating jobs.    Minister Pat Rabbitte‚Äôs upgrading of broadband infrastructure has seen Ireland move up the international league tables for high-speed connectivity, with all the attendant benefits for business, investment and jobs. Right now, hi-speed broadband is being installed in all secondary schools, with plans in place for new investment across rural Ireland.    Minister Ruairi Quinn‚Äôs passion for reform was the leitmotif of what has been an outstanding Ministerial career in various Governments. He took FAS and transformed it into a new service for training and further education that will help jobseekers get back into work. I wish him well in his retirement from politics. He will be missed.Minister Phil Hogan has introduced some of the biggest reforms of Government during his tenure that will have lasting benefits long into the future. Issues such as local government reform; the effective banning of corporate donations; new building regulations; a new water service; dealing with ground water pollution from septic tanks; and climate change to name but a few. His record of implementing difficult, but necessary, change will stand to him as EU Commissioner, and I wish him well in his new role.Minister Jimmy Deenihan‚Äôs tenure began what will be a successful decade of commemorations marking Ireland‚Äôs path to independence. He made major progress on the inherited and long-ignored issue of protecting our national bogs. Here, he negotiated with considerable sensitivity the plan to fulfil our environmental responsibilities while offering good solutions to landowners and turf cutters.I look forward to working closely with him in his important new role in connecting with the huge Irish diaspora throughout the word.I also congratulate the new members who are proposed for appointment as ministers. This is a great day for themselves and their families and I look forward to working with each of them as we build on the progress made by the Government over the past three years.A Cheann Comhairle,When we came to office, rescuing Ireland‚Äôs economy and restoring its reputation, were our top priorities. We were a Government for National Recovery.     Through our carefully-assembled plan, we have achieved this. Crucially, our reputation as a safe bet for inward investment has been restored.Last December, thanks to the hard work and enormous sacrifice of the Irish people sacrifice that at times they must have thought would never end we exited the EU-IMF bail out.That clean exit of the bailout, without requiring a precautionary credit line, or indeed the second bailout, predicted by many has improved Ireland‚Äôs standing and has allowed us to raise new funds, so we can safeguard the public services our people depend on in their lives day-to-day.With new policies to encourage job creation right across the economy, and with competitiveness high on our agenda, we have seen encouraging progress in our stated aim which is to get Ireland working.Last year alone saw 61,000 new jobs. That‚Äôs not only over 1,000 jobs a week for men and women all over the country. It‚Äôs the highest, employment-growth rate in Europe.Through our ambitious, but necessary, reforms of the social welfare system led by the Tanaiste we‚Äôre making sure that we help the long-term unemployed back into work which is where our hardworking and dignified men and women want to be.Yes for sure in these very difficult years for our country we haven‚Äôt got everything right. In the circumstances, I believe no government could.But over the three years, we made the difficult, but necessary, decisions. Because we were determined that, with this government, it would be people and country first.That we would, at last, get Ireland moving again in the right direction.Since we exited the EU/IMF bailout, I‚Äôm glad to say that the economy has continued to recover strongly.But vital as it is and was I want to stress that economic recovery was never the end in itself.Economic recovery is about creating the kind of environment where enterprise and jobs can thrive.     Where we can provide people the kind of public services they deservePutting a decent roof over their headsGiving people confidence and security in their lives so that they can start to see day-to-day that the huge sacrifices they have made for the recovery now have all been worthwhile.I‚Äôm glad to say that some people are experiencing this already. For them, at last, confidence is creeping in life has improved and when you meet them you can see the relief and the new hope in their faces their attitude.But many more people many more people are not yet experiencing the upturn. They have yet to see and measure the benefits of the recovery in their lives.I want to assure the people of Ireland that their efforts and sacrifices to date will neither be taken for granted nor squandered by this Government.The resources we have at hand will be used to promote ever more job creation.It is by returning the country to full employment that we can best reach our goal of making Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, to raise a family and to grow old with dignity and security.And as we enter this new phase of recovery, I want to pay tribute to our workers.Despite waves of economic instability, they got out and they got to work.And because they did they got us the country back on track.Today, we owe our workers our recovery.     On every trade mission I go on, at every meeting with foreign investors, I hear lavish praise for the skill and commitment of our workers.Today, I want to say to our workers and particularly to the middle income and low earnersI know it‚Äôs been galling.I know that at times the anxiety alone has been suffocating.Yes ‚Äì the Government has already removed 330,000 earners from the Universal Social Charge.     The introduction of that charge by the previous Government brought the top rate of tax to 52%     52 per cent for individuals and families on average incomes.This is neither right nor tolerable for you nor sustainable for the countryThe Government wants to make work pay for Ireland‚Äôs families.Now, especially, we want to make their lives that bit better easier.The objective of Government should always be to create the conditions and supports to allow families to thrive, prosper and reach their full potential.A plan to make work pay will be a big part of our priorities for the remainder of this Government.Fairness and job creation will go hand in hand. Everyone must have the opportunity to work and live their lives at home.The changes at Cabinet level outlined today reflect the best team to take recovery forward.There is still much to do and all of it urgent.The new Ministers will bring a new approach and energy to job creation and to making sure that the recovery, for which people sacrificed so much, reaches every family in Ireland.In the remaining months of this Government there will be a relentless focus on restoring our domestic economy so we have rapid job growth, on the scale needed to return Ireland to full employment.     In addition to our Action Plan for Jobs we will target specific sectors of the economy for particular attention.Agri food possesses huge potential for Ireland. The agri-food sector is one the biggest and best domestic industries.With the right supports, we estimate that 25,000 new jobs can be created in this sector in the next seven years.     The construction sector is another part of the domestic economy that has a key role to play in our recovery and in creating new jobs.Right now, this sector is too small for the needs of our growing economy.We need high-quality business space in order to attract in new investment.The negative impact of lack of housing supply in the capital is both unmissable and unacceptable.To bring construction back to a sustainable position, we have a plan to create 60,000 jobs.One sector that has shown encouraging signs of growth since the Government introduced new measures within 100 days of entering office, has been tourism.Last year, The Gathering was a major success.This week the Government published a new tourism strategy to add 50,000 new jobs over the next decade.This year has also seen a shake up in how local government will support local businesses.Now there are 31 new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) nationwide to provide advice and support to people starting businesses at local level.To further help Irish retailers win new business, the Government is targeting 1,000 outlets this year to start trading online via a new Voucher Scheme. By helping small Irish business trade online we expect 3,200 new jobs to be created in this area over the next two years.As the economy begins to recover we must also value, protect and nurture our hard-won competitiveness gains. Creating a competitive business environment that supports an increase in exports is essential in ensuring Ireland achieves growth and, crucially, gets more people back to work.Conclusion     These are just some short examples of the hard work and agenda ahead.Each Minister will outline how she or he in their portfolio, will promote jobs and better support our working families.In addition, the Government will shortly publish a Statement of Priorities for the remainder of our term.As we return to better or more ‚Äònormal‚Äô times this document outlines how we intend to give a hand to working families along with low and middle-income workers.     We intend to make sure that recovery is felt and deeply in every city, town and village across this country.Yes Ireland has been through the wars.There isn‚Äôt a family in any part that hasn‚Äôt been affected.But my message here today is that already, we‚Äôre in recovery things are getting better and we intend now to make sure they get better for everyone.We know that the people are impatient to see and feel this recovery in their lives.They‚Äôre impatient to see and feel the change for which they made such sacrifice.And as the government we are every bit as impatient for that as they are.I have a strong belief in this country. I have a powerful faith in our people.In the time I have been privileged to be Taoiseach I have travelled all over the country.     I‚Äôve spoken to all manner of people I‚Äôve listened to their stories sometimes of great loss great anxiety.And I have learned that despite this.Belief fragile as it is exists.We can say we have learned from the difficult past only if we make sure not to repeat it.With the actions and decisions the government has taken as bitter and unwelcome as they have been for many I believe we will not repeat that past.Rather, there is both the will and the possibility now to move forward. To rebuild. To renew. To recreate.There‚Äôs a chance now for change a welcome and overdue change so we‚Äôre not just gritting our teeth keeping the head down and surviving but that we can get to live our lives.In government, we will give every help, every opportunity, every support to make that happen. It is both our intention and our duty that we would.",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes external influence rather than bias within state institutions favoring any specific group.

160238.0," The seemingly intractable problem of Brexit continues. After MPs rejected Boris Johnson‚Äôs plans to rush his deal with the EU through in three days, a further extension requested by Parliament against the wishes of the government was granted. Now, voters are set to go to the polls on 12th December after Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs Labour backed the call, assured that a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit is effectively off the table.It is no wonder that many people are fed up with this saga. Nonetheless, Johnson‚Äôs plan for a ‚Äòbargain basement‚Äô Brexit has important implications for workers, particularly in Northern Ireland, and should be opposed.For socialists, Brexit is symptomatic of a broader crisis for capitalism globally. This is reflected in the escalation of a trade war between the US and China, the two largest capitalist powers in the world, alongside elements of a process of ‚Äúde-globalisation‚Äù, with the emergence of protectionism and inter-imperialist rivalry more generally. Politically, it also reflects a crisis of the ‚Äúextreme centre‚Äù, the neo-liberal consensus of cuts, privatisation and an unfettered ‚Äòfree market‚Äô which has dominated for decades. This has resulted in the rise of left-wing, reformist leaders like Corbyn and Sanders, but also right-populists like Johnson and Trump.No race to the bottomThere are two main differences between Johnson‚Äôs deal and that negotiated by Theresa May. It removes legally binding commitments to ensure workers‚Äô rights and environmental standards are aligned with the EU in order to provide a ‚Äòlevel playing field‚Äô. This is aimed at winning over the Tory hard right, who dream of a ‚ÄúSingapore-on-Thames‚Äù and¬† plan to recast Britain as a low-tax and low-regulation economy.Despite assurances from Johnson, in order to gain support from some Labour MPs, these issues will ultimately be dealt with in future trade negotiations ‚Äì not just between the EU and UK, but also between the UK and US. The Trump administration has already set out its stall for such negotiations, including the removal of food standards which block the import of chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-pumped beef and so on. A future trade deal could also threaten the cherry-picking of the NHS for privatisation, similar to the defeated EU-US free trade agreement TTIP, as well as increases in the cost of medicines by US pharmaceutical giants.At the same time, the Johnson-EU deal includes a commitment that, ‚ÄúThe Parties should in particular maintain a robust and comprehensive framework for competition and state aid control that prevents undue distortion of trade and competition.‚Äù In other words, the British government would still be bound by EU rules which block socialist measures such as nationalisation, despite no longer being in the single market. This, in part, is to mark the cards of a potential Corbyn government, creating barriers to implementing popular measures like bringing the railways and other sectors of the economy into public ownership.The border problemThe second related change is the removal of May‚Äôs proposed ‚ÄòIrish backstop‚Äô. The new arrangement would mean that Northern Ireland will leave the customs union with Britain but will remain closely aligned to the single market regulations. There would be customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland, and potentially regulatory checks as Britain diverges from EU standards. This would effectively mean a hardening of an east-west border.Stormont ‚Äì if functioning ‚Äì would have a say on how long alignment to the single market would last, but the mechanism would be very different from the ‚Äútime-limited backstop‚Äù the DUP were prepared to accept. If a majority of MLAs designated as Unionist and nationalist both vote in favour, then the next vote would take place in eight years. If it is passed by a simple majority, then the next vote would take place in four years. This is an important shift in how contentious issues are dealt with at Stormont, and would effectively mean that the question of whether there should be a harder border between North and South or between Britain and Northern Ireland will be a looming issue to be regularly returned to.This deal only adds to the legitimate feeling of insecurity felt about the future by many ordinary Protestants. If there is a perception over time that their identity and the integrity of the Union is being further diminished and that Northern Ireland is being forced into an ‚Äúeconomic united ireland‚Äù, it could provoke a serious reaction, as we have seen in the past. A very large recent public meeting involving prominent figures associated with¬† loyalist paramilitaries heard talk of protests against this ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù gives an indication that protests similar to those against the removal of the Union flag from Belfast City Hall are possible.This is not simply a question of the attitudes of the DUP or other Unionist/loyalist organisations, but the concerns and fears of working-class Protestants. This is reflected in a recent LucidTalk poll, which showed that 53% of Unionists would prefer a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit over Johnson‚Äôs agreement, while only a third said they preferred the deal. Similarly, in a choice between remaining in the EU and Johnson‚Äôs deal, 43% chose to remain while 37% opted for the deal. Meanwhile, Sinn F√©in have welcomed the deal as a ‚Äúhalfway house‚Äù, as have representatives of other pro-remain parties.Workers‚Äô movement must actSocialists have a responsibility to oppose any measure which would heighten sectarianism in Northern Ireland. That includes any hardening of borders, be it east/west ‚Äì as with Johnson‚Äôs deal ‚Äì or north/south, which would not be tolerated, particularly by Catholics who would see it as copper-fastening partition. As the Socialist Party has consistently argued throughout the Brexit negotiations, the trade union movement ‚Äì which unites almost 250,000 workers in Northern Ireland, from across the sectarian divide ‚Äì must be prepared to take action against any moves which will inflame tensions.The General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), Patricia King, said Brexit was an emergency situation facing workers, North and South. We agree. It is clear that capitalist governments and employers will attempt to use Brexit as an excuse to attack workers‚Äô jobs, pay and conditions. Unfortunately, the response of the ICTU leadership to date has been limited to demands like calling for the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist workers who lose their jobs in the context of Brexit. This is entirely insufficient. The movement must prepare for a fight to defend jobs and conditions. The recent struggles of the Harland & Wolff and Wrightbus workers show what is needed: militant trade unionism.¬† These workers also raised an essential demand to safeguard jobs in the long run ‚Äì nationalisation.This agreement ‚Äì like any which could be negotiated between the Tories and the EU ‚Äì is a deal between two capitalist blocs and is not in the interests of working-class people. Socialists and the labour movement must reject the false choice between a Tory-led Brexit ‚Äì with or without a deal ‚Äì or remaining in the institutionally neo-liberal EU. The Labour Party conference‚Äôs rejection of a hard ‚Äòremain‚Äô position is a partial defeat for the Blairites, who represent the interests of British capitalism and who seek to use confusion around Brexit to undermine Corbyn. The leadership‚Äôs resolution, which passed, is for a Labour government to re-negotiate a deal with the EU and then put it to a confirmatory referendum with the option of remaining in the EU on the ballot paper.Fight general election with socialist policies¬†With a general election looming, Corbyn must put forward a clear programme which can speak to working-class voters, whether they backed ‚Äòleave‚Äô or ‚Äòremain‚Äô in 2016. Against the right-wing populism of Boris Johnson ‚Äì who will attempt to present himself as the defender of the people against an out-of-touch Parliament and committed to ‚Äúgetting Brexit done‚Äù ‚Äì a combative, socialist message is more necessary than ever. Corbyn should articulate and campaign for a socialist exit from the EU which would free a future government under his leadership from the restrictions on nationalisation, public spending and state intervention into the economy ‚Äì which would act as a barrier to his policies ‚Äì while guaranteeing workers‚Äô rights, migrants‚Äô rights, environmental safeguards and so on. Combined with demands for free education, reducing the working week, massive investment in social housing and renewable energy, democratic public ownership of key sectors of the economy and other pro-working class measures, it is possible for him to secure a majority in Parliament.To actually implement these policies in the face of the opposition of the capitalist establishment, Corbyn would have to mobilise the British working class and make an appeal to workers and young people across Europe. He would also have to finish the civil war within Labour and decisively drive out the Blairites, who seek to undermine his leadership and block his policies at every turn. Corbyn and those around him have sought conciliation with the right for too long, and it has increased the confidence of their implacable enemies. Corbyn supporters within Labour should immediately move to unseat sitting Blairite MPs through trigger ballots, allowing the membership to democratically replace them with working-class fighters for socialist policies.NI ‚Äì Workers need an anti-sectarian political voiceIn Northern Ireland, working-class people will once again be faced with a sectarian headcount. General elections, given the close margins in some constituencies, can particularly take on this character. The Brexit crisis and the current deal will significantly add to that. ‚ÄòUnity‚Äô candidates ‚Äì whether openly in a communal guise or in a disguised form around Brexit ‚Äì would not provide any solutions but will further sectarianise the election.This underlines the urgent need to build an anti-sectarian, working-class alternative that can seek to unite people around our common interests. The recent and ongoing industrial disputes here clearly demonstrate that workers have no friends among the main parties, whether Orange, Green or neither. Similarly, the battle for abortion rights and marriage equality was only won through struggle which forced the main parties, some times kicking and screaming, to shift their positions. A mass working-class party could not only take up the issues that clearly unite working-class and young people, but also find solutions to those that divides us, on the basis of mutual respect and solidarity, rather than through conflict and coercion, which is all any capitalist arrangement can offer.For a socialist EuropeCapitalism today means crises ‚Äì economic, political and environmental. It‚Äôs a system destroying our planet, undermining our living standards and creating the basis for the emergence of reactionary, bigoted figures such as Johnson, Trump and Bolsonaro. The capitalist governments of Europe and the EU, who represent this system, are part of the problem, not the solution.We need to break with this system, which pits worker against worker, and fight for socialist change. This requires a break with the bosses‚Äô EU, where cooperation between the ruling classes is based on maximising profit at the expense of the working class. Instead, we need to fight for a socialist confederation of Europe ‚Äì free, voluntary and equal ‚Äì based on solidarity and cooperation between workers across the continent, using society‚Äôs wealth and resources in a planned and democratic way to raise living standards and tackle climate change.",no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes media bias and political promises but does not claim state institutions always favor a certain group.

122328.0," Labour Spokesperson on Education, Joan Burton TD, has today written to the Chair of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, Fiona O‚ÄôLoughlin, calling for hearings to be held into the circumstances, considerations and motives surrounding the agreement between the State and certain religious congregations of June 2002.11th April, 2017¬†Re: Residential institutions redress ‚Äì indemnity and contribution agreement with religious congregations¬†Dear Chair,¬†I am writing to request that you put on the committee‚Äôs agenda a proposal that we hold hearings to inquire into the circumstances, considerations and motives surrounding the agreement between the State and certain religious congregations of June 2002.¬†I think it is clear that my reason for seeking such an inquiry is not one of prurience or idle curiosity. That agreement has had ‚Äì and continues to have ‚Äì enormous impact, not least financial impact. I believe we need, finally, to get to the bottom of it.¬†On the 11th May 1999, the then Taoiseach offered an apology on behalf of the State to victims of abuse in residential institutions. The report of the Child Abuse Commission has more than proven the need for that apology.¬†I accept that the State is liable to the victims of residential child abuse. It was the State, after all, that sent children to those institutions and the State was charged with the supervision, regulation and inspection of those institutions.Clearly, there was a massive and chronic failure on the part of the State in its duty to its most vulnerable citizens ‚Äì and the State should be involved in compensating them, so far as money can do, for the injuries they have suffered.But of course that should not be the end of the matter. The question is not whether the State was liable but whether it alone was liable.From the point of view of Irish society and the Irish taxpayer, the division of liability between the State and the religious congregations that ran these institutions has been disastrous.The Residential Institutions Redress Act became law on the 10th April, 2002. According to that Act ‚ÄìWhat the Oireachtas did not debate was an entirely separate non-statutory scheme entered into between the State and 18 religious congregations. According to that scheme, the State was now underwriting any possible future liability of the contributing congregations arising from court claims, regardless as to whether those claims had been notified to the Redress Board and an award offered and accepted.That deal was apparently agreed in principle in April and finalised in June, 2002. But its terms are nowhere reflected in the Act that was passing through the Oireachtas at exactly the same time.There are a number of issues arising. First, the size of the contributions made by the congregations: relative to the total cost of the redress scheme, their contributions fall far short of the anticipated 50% of the final cost. And in fact the total of cash payments from the congregations, which were paid into the special account from which redress awards were made, was far less than the ‚Ç¨127 million so often referred to. The deal involves:None of these can be translated into cash for statutory purposes. These additional transfers of land and the provision of counselling or other services, that were added on to bring the total up to ‚Ç¨127 million, are not within the framework of the Redress Act. They are not payments into an account of monies with the Paymaster General, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and so on.What‚Äôs more, it is a pretty basic principle of law that ‚Äúpast consideration is no consideration‚Äù: a contract cannot be based upon consideration that was provided before the promise was made. In other words, I cannot become contractually bound to you to perform a service in return for money or property which you have given me before the contract was made. So, in normal contractual terms, the land already transferred can be discounted when valuing this aspect of the deal, as can counselling services already provided.Second, there was the fact that the contributions were made under a non-statutory deed of indemnity which greatly extended the benefits conferred on the congregations and exceeded the terms of the Act. As well as being indemnified against having to compensate twice an individual who sought redress under the Act and then sought compensation in court, the congregations were now indemnified by the State against the costs and awards of any claim by an individual who might now or in future take an action against them, regardless as to whether that individual made a claim to the Redress Board ‚Äì and regardless even as to whether the State was or could be liable as a co-defendant in any such legal action.Third, where did the Minister for Education derive his legal capacity to bind the State in this way ‚Äì a way that went outside the terms of the legislation going through the Oireachtas and which accepted sole responsibility for unknown future contingent liabilities, over years?Our party argued at the time that there was no statutory basis for the additional guarantee to the congregations. The deed clearly did not arise from the legislation, since it set out an indemnity that the legislation neither authorised not even envisaged.The Taoiseach replied that the Government and each of its Ministers did not need specific statutory authority. They had a ‚Äúgeneral power to settle‚Äù litigation and were entitled to enter into agreements for that purpose.Of course it is true that Government Ministers have the power to settle any cases brought against them relating to the performance of official functions.But the State did not just settle actions against itself by entering this agreement. It was cases against the congregations that were settled. The State increased rather than reduced its potential liability. As a very early example of the consequences of this deal, there was the High Court action brought by Mr Patrick Morgan against the sister in charge of Nazareth House in Co Sligo. Under the terms of the indemnity, the State was obliged to take over the case at less than one week‚Äôs notice and the action was settled on its second day of hearing. The State became liable to pay the negotiated settlement amount, plus the costs of both sides, in an action to which it was never a party.The Taoiseach‚Äôs position in the correspondence with us was that the negotiation and conclusion of the indemnity deal did not need statutory authority because it was an exercise of the ‚Äúinherent‚Äù powers of the executive branch of government, in relation to the management and control of State litigation.This amounts to an effective concession that the Residential Institutions Redress Act does not and never did provide a statutory basis for the agreement with the congregations ‚Äì our central assertion but one that was consistently resisted both at ministerial and official level.I think the committee might arrive at its own view as to whether the power to settle litigation includes a power to assume the liabilities of a third party in cases to which neither the State nor a Minister is a party in the first place.Fourth, at its meeting of the 5th June ‚Äì Minister Woods‚Äô last day in office ‚Äì the Government noted ‚Äúthat the Minister for Education and Science had reached agreement with representatives of the religious orders on the contribution to be made by them to the compensation fund in respect of victims of abuse in institutions‚Äù. On the same day, a public statement was made that the Government had agreed in principle to the proposals that the religious congregations contribute ‚Ç¨128 million to the scheme.What we do not know, however, is whether the Government either knew of or approved any side deal with the congregations, conferring an additional indemnity.Fifth, Article 11 of the Constitution provides that the revenues of the State ‚Äúshall be appropriated for the purposes and in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities determined and imposed by law‚Äù. Yet the result of this deal is that public moneys were appropriated for a purpose for which there was no statutory authority.Sixth, the signed deed of the 5th June 2002 concluded between the Minister for Education Michael Woods TD and the 18 religious congregations was drafted by the solicitors for the congregations and not in the Attorney General‚Äôs Office and its terms were never debated in the D√°il.A subsequent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which correctly forecast that the total liability arising from the scheme could exceed ‚Ç¨1 billion, revealed that ‚ÄìSeventh, I believe that the indemnity exposed the Exchequer to a substantial contingent liability in a manner that flouted the rules of good financial housekeeping set out by the Department of Finance in ‚ÄúPublic Financial Procedures‚Äù. According to the then current version of that document, at C1.4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúAuthority for Expenditure‚Äù ‚Äì‚ÄúSome schemes have been introduced and continue to exist wholly on the basis of the Appropriation Act. In such cases it will be generally be found that ‚ÄìIt could not be argued that expenditure arising on foot of the indemnity was small, covered by the ambit of the Vote concerned or uncontroversial.Eighth, there are further peculiar aspects to the written agreement of the 5th June 2002. It is ‚Äì or purports to be ‚Äì a formal deed, rather than an unsealed, ordinary contract.A deed is an instrument in writing, signed and sealed. Companies have seals they can use for their purposes. Government Ministers are corporations sole and have seals and have legal capacity to enter into deeds.Natural persons do not usually have seals or use them as part of our everyday business, but we are entitled to use seals for conveyancing.But the religious congregations, on the other hand, are private, voluntary, unincorporated associations of individuals. They have much the same status in civil law as residents‚Äô associations or GAA clubs.They do not have ‚Äònatural‚Äô legal status because they are not individuals. And they do not have corporate status because they have never chosen to seek incorporation in Irish law.It may of course be that the congregations have some form of corporate status under Roman Catholic canon law and it may be that they use seals for canonical purposes. But that has nothing to do with their status under the law of the State.And it also may be that there are companies associated with some of these congregations and there may well also be associated trusts. But the deed of the 5th June 2002 was not signed by any of the leaders of the congregations in their capacities as company directors or as trustees. It is simply signed by them and purportedly sealed by them, for example: ‚ÄúSigned, sealed and delivered by Br. Michael Reynolds and Br John Burke for and on behalf of the Congregation of Christian Brothers‚Äù.I have been advised that this raises a question as to whether this was ever a valid deed in Irish law. Because the congregations are not corporate bodies in civil law, have no seals and so have no capacity to enter into deeds.And because it would seem that the 18 individuals, heads of religious congregations, who signed this document did so not in their personal capacities but in their capacities as heads, ‚Äúfor and on behalf‚Äù of the various congregations. They were acting as agents. But an individual entering into a deed using his personal seal in an ostensibly representative capacity on behalf of an unincorporated association cannot bind that association to the deed.So, why choose the formula of making a deed for this agreement, the one legal instrument the congregations had no capacity to make?Was it perhaps because a deed as opposed to an ordinary contract is binding and enforceable even if there is no valid consideration between the parties?Under this agreement, the congregations received a guarantee that they would be indemnified against cases brought against them by third parties, regardless as to whether the State was or even could be made a co-defendant in those cases. Arguably, this was a unilateral promise on the part of the State, without consideration.There was also the fact that much of the consideration coming from the congregations under the agreement consisted of property that had been already transferred to State agencies. In other words, much of it was ‚Äúpast consideration‚Äù and so not valid consideration. But a deed does not need valid consideration to become binding.Hence the question: would this have been a valid contract if it was not made under seal? And, if its validity can only be defended on the basis that it was a deed rather than an ordinary unsealed contract, was it a valid deed?Finally, it seems that we may not have the full information about dealings between the Government and the congregations. Is there another agreement? For example, the legislation nowhere says how additional institutions can become covered by the redress scheme. It seems to be assumed by everyone that the scheme would only be extended to cover institutions whose congregations had contributed to the redress fund. But is that understanding reduced to writing anywhere? Again, the ‚Ç¨128 million figure is not referenced in either the Act or the deed. Is it written down somewhere else?In summary, it seems to me that the committee should examine why ‚ÄìI am of course aware that a lot of this is history. But I do believe that there remains an unanswerable case for re-opening the indemnity deal with the religious congregations.The whole sorry saga raises the question what was the point of the D√°il and Seanad deliberating and voting on proposed legislation, setting out in quite elaborate terms a future course of action if, behind the scenes, secret negotiations entered into by Government members without legal advice exposed the State to a different scenario entirely?Yours sincerely,¬†__________________Joan Burton TDLabour Party Spokeswoman on Education",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes parliamentary procedures, claiming state institutions show bias by favoring certain ideological priorities over classical rights.

Liatroma.As I said, I want to begin firstly by welcoming you all to the Se√°n Mac Diarmada Summer School and for being here with us today in Kiltyclogher, where this afternoon our discussion focuses on Brexit and its fallout.I‚Äôd also like to start by giving particular thanks to the organisers of this year‚Äôs event for all their hard work in putting this year‚Äôs fantastic programme together.I want to thank them sincerely for asking me to come along here this afternoon to speak with you and to contribute to what has been a stimulating and engaging series which I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed being a part of.I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all agree that there are few more apt locations than this, here in the small Leitrim village of Kiltyclogher on the Fermanagh border, in which to hold such a conversation on a topic which will, without question, have such profound and potentially life altering effects on the very social and economic fabric of our island.I do not have to tell any of you here today about the significant contribution which this small community has¬†made throughout the years, in what is, the yet on-going struggle for Irish freedom.Arguably, it‚Äôs most famous son, one Se√°n Mac Diarmada, after whom this very Summer School is named, is indicative of the long, proud and noble republican legacy and tradition for which this area has become renowned.Mac Diarmada, like many before and indeed many after him, would go on to make the ultimate sacrifice for his beliefs: A Republic of equals, indivisible, united and free.A century on from his death, and while much has undoubtedly been done to bring about the Ireland as envisaged by Mac Diarmada and the other leaders of the Rising, this land remains divided: its people separated by a border which never should have been, a nation still shamefully partitioned by a foreign oppressor.Inevitably, this leads one to ask the all too often uttered question: ‚ÄúWas it for this the brave sons and daughters of √âire died?‚ÄùAnd while today, thanks in no small part to the contributions of countless Irish men and women down through the years, and aided by our joint membership of the European Union, today ‚Äì while still there ‚Äì the border has become all but invisible.Brexit, I dare say, will inevitably change that.And this leads me nicely to the topic of my own speech which I‚Äôve been invited to deliver to you here today which is ‚ÄòBrexit, the Economy and the Impact on the Border Regions'.A chairde, it‚Äôs safe to say that with Brexit we find ourselves in unchartered territory.I am not going to stand here and tell you the EU is perfect or that is the antidote to British policy in Ireland.I accept that across Europe in Belgium, Germany, France even there are many who see the EU and being European as part of their identity, as an unquestionable force for good. I believe my party‚Äôs position of critical engagement with the EU is closer to the pragmatic unromantic position of the Irish people with regard to the EU and to the issue of European cooperation.For me membership of the EU is fact that isn‚Äôt going to change anytime soon - it is a club we are in and within which we must assert our rights, not simply go along with everything.It is going in the wrong direction - adopting more and more powers and insisting on a uniform economic policy for its members.The EU lacks democratic accountability - the ECB‚Äôs power over our lives is astonishing yet it has only the bare minimum of accountability to the people.What the EU did to the people of Greece was disgusting - what they did in Ireland was brutal even if it was aided by local bandits.It has ambitions to be a military alliance and to harmonise tax policies.In short it is deeply flawed but to not engage, to wish it away is simply not credible.We do not have the oil of Norway nor the gold of Switzerland.In a pragmatic and hard-headed way we know we are better off inside the tent.The old certainties which, in recent years have only come about through a commitment by all sides to an all-island spirit of co-operation and renewed friendship now face their biggest test to date.The signing of the Good Friday Agreement; the removal of physical as well as psychological borders; as well as the progress made to advance peace and reconciliation across the island were each made that bit more possible thanks to the EU.Britain‚Äôs withdrawal from it will undoubtedly pose a huge challenge to all this.Because, what‚Äôs clear is that Brexit will be one of the single greatest political events of our time: one which will be both global in scale and in consequence.And yet, despite this, nowhere will the effects of Brexit be harder or more acutely felt than right here on this island.And it will be the north of Ireland, as well as the entire border region in particular which ultimately will find itself at Brexit‚Äôs global and tumultuous epicentre.This is a region, which for years has suffered from chronic underinvestment and under employment, due by-in-large to indifference from both Irish and British Governments down through the years, that it is unthinkable to contemplate just how it can withstand the many complications arising from Brexit.It will be here, should the Westminster establishment have their way, soon to consist of the Torys and their pro-Brexit¬†bedfellows in the DUP, that we here in Ireland may just see the erection of the EU‚Äôs newest and potentially most destructive frontier.And make no mistake about it; should the north be dragged out of the EU against the democratically expressed wishes of its people, then the progress of recent years, as well as all that we‚Äôve now come to take for granted, will face a precarious future.It‚Äôs simply me stating the obvious when I say that Brexit runs entirely counter to Irish national interest.It runs counter to the countless families, workers, tourists and to the hundreds of business people who, each and every day, travel freely and frequently across the border.Post-Brexit, it will be every ordinary man, woman, and child living here who will find themselves having fallen victim to such circumstance: a devastating reality and turn of events not of their making, nor of their choosing.And while ‚Äútime will tell‚Äù, as the old saying goes is equally applicable to Brexit and its outcomes, so far this adage has certainly proven to be the case in relation to exposing the economic arguments put forward by those who have long supported and been keen advocates and promoters of Brexit.The lauded benefits of Britain‚Äôs withdrawal, heralded by certain political factions, have proven to be nothing more than farce: a lie spun by those driven by a sinister ideology, a political doctrine fuelled by malice, ignorance and self-interest.As a consequence, the economy of the island ‚Äì and in particular the border corridor ‚Äì stands to be amongst the hardest hit.A return to border security controls, the reappearance of customs barriers, as well as heightened restrictions on trade, all raise very real and valid concerns about the future, of not only our geo-political landscape going forward, but the economic landscape as well.This is because the economies of this island ‚Äì both north and south ‚Äì are today more interconnected and interdependent than at any time in our recent past.As a result, they stand to be disproportionately affected by Britain‚Äôs withdrawal from the EU. To put this economic symbiosis into context, one only has to look at the numbers.Each week, more than ‚Ç¨1.2 billion is traded in goods and services between the north, the south and Britain.That‚Äôs more than ‚Ç¨150 million each day.In real terms, those figures represent jobs, wages and livelihoods.None of this would have been made possible without the freedoms guaranteed under EU membership.And behind each of these stats, there are some 200,000 jobs which depend directly on all this trade.However, any major alteration or shift in this existing trading relationship, such as that likely to occur following Brexit,¬†could have grave implications for Ireland: not least of all for us here along the border.And the idea of consequences is far from mere fantasy.Only last month in fact, during the Oireachtas Finance Committee, officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners disclosed to me that customs checks-points along the border are being actively examined as part of the state‚Äôs Brexit contingency planning.With approximately 1 million HGVs and 1.3 million LGVs making crossings into and out of the north each and every year, the idea that suddenly, over the course of a single night in less than two years‚Äô time, we‚Äôll see this freight traffic having to undergo customs checks at any number of policed customs posts dotted along the border is simply unthinkable.Such a scenario would, in effect, not only cripple border businesses, but would render this area, and many communities right along the border, unemployment black-spot for many years to come.And don‚Äôt just take my word for it.There is actually a wealth of opinions and research, much of which has been compiled by independent and expert bodies and organisations, which all point towards the same devastating conclusion in terms of the ramifications of Brexit.BDO Customs and International Trade Services, a company which specialises in International and European customs and trade arrangements, offering its global client base expert legal advice on customs requirements in the many¬†jurisdictions across the EU, US and Asia, has estimated that the additional costs involved for border business in meeting its customs obligations post-Brexit to likely come in at around ‚Ç¨100 per consignment.This is further reinforced by similar warnings and claims made in recent days by Chartered Accountants of Ireland.The institute, which represents some 25,000 members working across the globe, has likened the burden of post-Brexit customs requirements as being akin to a ‚Äúnew tax‚Äù effectively being placed on businesses here once Britain leaves the EU.There is no question about it; this is a burden which the some 12,000 companies, as well as the countless number of businesses whose goods transit Britain for other markets each and every day, can ill-afford.Officialdom and authorities here in this state are advising these traders and transport operators to begin to make long-term plans in anticipation of these heightened customs obligations post-Brexit.In reality though, the lack of clarity surrounding the nature of the agreement which will ensue after negotiations have ended means that the vast majority of companies here have yet to do so.In fact, recent surveys suggest that just one in twenty firms have a plan in place to deal with a potential customs Border with the north following Brexit.And the burden of customs requirements is not merely confined to freight operators and businesses either.For individuals living this side of the border, the trip into the north to shop and purchase goods too will be subject to similar tax implications.Under existing rates for third countries, duty on goods valued in excess of ‚Ç¨300 and which are being brought in from across a land border are subject to customs duty, with the duty payable dependent on the item being imported.While VAT is generally payable at the same rates as apply to goods sold within the state.To put this into some context, for a person here travelling to Enniskillen to buy a tv, they will be effectively breaking the law if they do not declare the additional VAT on that purchase when returning across the border. Clearly, the imposition of such border and customs procedures will ultimately spell an end to the unhindered and unopposed open and free trading relationship which today is enjoyed by every one of us; not least of all the many border communities that lie either side of it.In terms of the implications for the wider economy, one only has to cast their minds back to earlier this year when the Government made the announcement that, following an analysis and evaluation of the economic outlook, its forecasters have predicted that the cost of Brexit to the Irish economy would likely be between ‚Ç¨2.5 billion and ‚Ç¨3 billion over the next two years.This means that the State‚Äôs GDP growth figures and own fiscal projections may yet have to be revised downwards ‚Äì and this is before Brexit has even happened.Moving away from the economic impacts for a few moments and what it shall mean for business and trade, the prospect of the Border now becoming an international frontier between this state and the north creates particular concerns for others also.The EU affords our students for example, the opportunity to study in other member states.Many students here take up this opportunity each year, and choose to live and study on oppose sides of the border.What will Brexit mean for them?Will they see a tripling of their fees as they have, overnight, become classified as International students from a third country?What will Brexit mean for the future of north-south co-operation in the area of our health services where, each year, countless patients from border areas in particular are referred to undergo procedures and receive medical treatment?How will the health service here, which already struggles to cope with existing pressures and patient demand, be able to withstand the ending of the north‚Äôs participation in EU facilitated schemes such as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive where, last year, some 40% of the scheme‚Äôs participants from the state went to receive treatment?Equally, and as I‚Äôll talk more about in just a little while, what will Brexit mean for the future of Agriculture, particularly in the north, where some 87% of total farm incomes are subsidised by EU farming supports.How will the sector fair and remain sustainable going forward post-Brexit?These examples are but a few of the sectors, sections of society and groups which stand to be most adversely affected by the Brexit fallout.And yes, while it‚Äôs fair to say that Brexit is a result of atypical Tory arrogance - a callous pursuit of that party‚Äôs reckless and narrow minded vision for our islands and Europe ‚Äì the example shown to date by the powers that be in Dublin has hardly been awe inspiring.Unsurprisingly, the Irish government too has failed to demonstrate any real ambition or assertiveness in terms of its own Brexit planning, nor in how it shall approach the negotiations which lie ahead.So far, we‚Äôve yet to see any great detail as to how this state plans to deal with the unique challenges which Bexit will pose for the economy and for the future of trade on this island and with Britain.Little by the way of reassurance has been afforded to the Business community, while communities up and down this state remain fearful of what is coming down the Brexit track.For our farmers and producers, the implications of Brexit are not a far off distant prospect but are real in their consequence today and are being felt.Likewise in the north, some ¬£340million in agriculture and fisheries funding was paid out in 2015 alone to ensure a modern and vibrant industry.While the some ‚Ç¨2.5 billion worth of Single Farm Payments from the EU to the north, and the hard question of where those vital supports will come from in future too is playing heavy on the minds of farmers there.And on the important issue of structural funds and subsidies, Ireland ‚Äì north and south ‚Äì has benefitted greatly also.The north alone received some ¬£160 million in structural and investment funds, and a further ¬£270 million in Peace funding throughout 2015, and the economic and social benefits which these initiatives have created cannot be overlooked, nor can their contribution to bringing about a real and tangible sense of peace and reconciliation across this island.In the areas of Science and research too, the benefits of EU sponsored programmes have also yielded significant economic benefits for researchers north and south, and we cannot let Brexit force us to must out in this arena in future.Evidently, in such a defining moment as this for the future direction of this island, how we respond to Brexit and rise to meet the challenges posed by it will come to not only define this generation, but it will mark how future generations both live and co-exist going forward.This is why it is so crucial that a new way of thinking is adopted by everyone in terms of how we approach these negotiations.Imaginative and innovative thinking is needed if we are to mitigate the challenges of Brexit, minimise its threats, and achieve and ensure the delivery of the future betterment of our entire island.And this is why, aside from being Brexit‚Äôs most vocal opponent, Sinn F√©in too has been leading the charge in arguing our party‚Äôs official Brexit position which is for special designated status for the north within the EU to be delivered.Such a proposal, far from being unrealistic, would see the north retain its full access to the single market, the Customs Union, and hence allow for the free movement of our people, goods, services and capital on a north-south basis.We believe that such a solution is necessary to protect all-Ireland trade, our agriculture and agri-food sectors, as well the free movement of people, of our workers as well as the protection of workers‚Äô rights.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes an appointment decision but does not claim a bias in state institutions toward a specific group.

159650.0,"Capitalist leaders are in disarray as they strive and fail to get to grips with the eurozone crisis and its threat to the global economy.Neither the G20 summit in Mexico, nor crisis talks in Rome offered any solutions, as politicians and economists desperately try to hang on to the eurozone roller-coaster.Once again, the eurozone crisis dominated the G20 meeting of world capitalist leaders (Los Cabos, Mexico, 18-19 June).Yet again, the meeting concluded with a bland communiqu√© with no concrete measures to tackle either the eurozone crisis or the deepening global crisis.Barack Obama, facing presidential elections in November, desperately called on the eurozone leaders to resolve the debt crisis and temper austerity measures with ‚Äògrowth policies‚Äô.European leaders, on the other hand, noted that Obama has not been able to promote a further stimulus package in the US because of Republican opposition in the Congress.Moreover, they warned that the US‚Äôs own debt burden, with the threat of colossal spending cuts in 2013, could push the US ‚Äì and the world economy ‚Äì over the edge of the abyss.Only three of the G7 countries (Canada, the US and Germany) have got back to their pre-crisis peak of production.Now US growth is petering out, while there is either stagnation or recession in the eurozone (with Germany now sliding into recession).In 2007-08, the housing mortgage crisis triggered a worldwide banking and financial crisis.Now the sovereign debt crisis holds both European governments and the major banks in the thrall of financial turmoil.Greece and Spain in particular are like time-bombs which could detonate a major explosion at any time.Eurozone crisisThe Rome meeting (22 June) of the leaders of the eurozone‚Äôs big four economies (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) demonstrated that the eurozone crisis is no nearer to resolution.They announced a ‚Ç¨130 billion ‚Äògrowth package‚Äô, but with very limited new money.They remained divided on the most acute issue, the continuing credit crisis.Mario Monti, Fran√ßois Hollande and Mariano Rajoy called for the use of the eurozone‚Äôs bail-out funds to ‚Äústabilise financial markets‚Äù.They want to authorise the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and later the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to intervene directly to support shaky banks.They also propose that the rescue funds should be able to buy the debt of ‚Äòvirtuous‚Äô countries to support their bonds (presumably ‚Äòvirtuous‚Äô means any eurozone country except Greece).Angela Merkel, however, opposed these proposals, once again highlighting the contradiction within the eurozone between a common currency and the national interests of member states.‚ÄúThere was an agreement among all of us‚Äù, claimed Spain‚Äôs prime minister, Rajoy, ‚Äúto use any necessary mechanism to obtain financial stability in the eurozone‚Äù.Responding to Merkel‚Äôs call for accelerated steps towards a fiscal union, Hollande said there could be ‚Äúno transfer of sovereignty without an improvement in solidarity‚Äù, continuing to advocate the need for mutualisation of eurozone debt, through eurobonds or some other mechanism.Solidarity, responded Merkel, was possible only with serious controls and collective oversight: ‚ÄúYou cannot have guarantees without control‚Äù.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that I do not want to provide help, but the treaties are set up in such a way that the governments are the partners‚Äù, Merkel said.In other words, the eurozone (or the European Union for that matter) is an inter-governmental organisation, not a federal state.Moreover, Germany has to finance around 30% of any eurozone intervention, and has so far contributed approximately ‚Ç¨300 billion to the various bailouts.‚ÄúGermany‚Äôs strength is not infinite, its powers are not unlimited‚Äù, protested Merkel in Rome.At the G20 meeting in Mexico, Obama and Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, were calling on the eurozone leaders to take urgent action to resolve the crisis, which is increasingly becoming a drag on the world economy.But even the terms of the bailout of the Spanish banks have not yet been fully resolved.It was agreed for the eurozone to provide up to ‚Ç¨100 billion to stabilise the Spanish banks.But there is no agreement on the procedure.Rajoy, Hollande and Monti are calling for the funds to go directly to the banks so they do not add to Spain‚Äôs sovereign debt (which would further undermine the country‚Äôs credit rating).Merkel, however, is insisting that the bail-out funds are channelled through the Spanish government.This explains why Spain‚Äôs borrowing costs remain well over 6% and have gone over 7% a number of times (compared, for instance, with 1.45% for France).Moreover, some eurozone leaders are insisting that the loans to Spain from the EFSF or the ESM will have ‚Äòseniority‚Äô, in other words, in the event of default they will have priority as far as repayment is concerned.This leads investors in the bond market to regard Spanish debt as even more of a risk, as they are demoted when it comes to credit or repayment in the event of default.Like the low-cost, long-term credit recently provided to European banks by the European Central Bank, bail-out funds for the Spanish banks are likely to have a very limited, short-lived effect on the crisis.Up until quite recently, the ECB was actively intervening to soften the eurozone credit crunch.It was buying eurozone government bonds, which tended to keep borrowing costs lower than they would otherwise be. Since June 2010, when the ECB started this ‚Äòsecurities market programme‚Äô, the bank has bought ‚Ç¨210.5 billion of bonds.However, in recent weeks the bank stopped the SMP programme, despite the fact that Spain‚Äôs bonds yields soared.The ECB also launched the Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs), allowing eurozone banks to borrow huge amounts from the ECB at low interest rates (and on the basis of a wide range of collateral).Among other things, this allowed banks to buy government bonds, a backdoor way of the ECB supporting eurozone governments.Early in June, however, the ECB changed its policy, refusing to buy any more government bonds.ECB officials indicated that they now regarded as the task of the EFSF and the ESM to buy eurozone government bonds.The ECB‚Äôs change of policy reflects, among other things, the pressure of the German government and others who oppose providing unlimited credit to debtor countries (as creditor countries like Germany would have to pick up the bill).The impasse of the eurozone is shown by the ESM, which is still not up and running.In effect, Hollande, Monti and others are proposing that (as the ECB does not act as a ‚Äòbank of last resort‚Äô, backing the debts of major governments) the ESM would act as a bank, with powers to directly support floundering banks or provide additional bail-out funds to eurozone governments.Merkel opposes this.Moreover, the ESM has yet to be approved by the German parliament, and this may be delayed for some time by a challenge to its constitutional legality in the German constitutional court.Merkel‚Äôs position reflects that of a section of the German capitalists, who are increasingly resentful at being called on to bail out the weaker economies (despite the advantages that Germany gained from being within the eurozone).Recent opinion polls show that 55% of German voters wish that Germany had kept the Deutschmark.This opposition to the eurozone will grow in the coming months.In Rome, the big four announced a new ‚Ç¨130 billion ‚Äògrowth fund‚Äô, which will be discussed by the European Council (Brussels, 28-29 June).‚Ç¨130 billion is about 1% of the eurozone gross domestic product, and might seem quite impressive at first sight.However, on closer inspection it appears to be quite a feeble package.‚ÄúThe ‚Ç¨130 billion would appear to represent a sum that might be raised or redirected from existing funds, rather than any commitment to new money‚Äù.(John Hooper, Guardian, 23 June) There is the promise of EU-financed infrastructure projects, but no concrete details.The Financial Times (22 June) commented: ‚ÄúNicholas Spiro, a sovereign risk analyst, said the ‚Äòrehashed‚Äô European growth compact was ‚Äòanother example of eurozone leaders desperately trying to paper over their differences while failing to address the issue which concerns investors the most: shoring up the sovereign debt markets of Spain and Italy‚Äô.‚Äù (Eurozone Rift Deepens Over Debt Crisis)In an editorial (22 June) the Financial Times warned: ‚ÄúClock ticking for the euro‚Äôs leaders‚Äù.Among other gloomy things for European capitalists, they point to Greek time-bomb: ‚ÄúFinancial markets‚Äù (that is, big financial speculators) ‚Äútook scant relief in the victory of one Greek party [New Democracy] that wants to renegotiate the country‚Äôs rescue deal over another [Syriza] that wants to reject it outright‚Äù.The new prime minister, Antonis Samaras, leader of New Democracy, is now demanding that the implementation of austerity measures already agreed in return for two bail-out packages should be postponed for two years.It is estimated that this would require a further ‚Ç¨20 billion in bail-out funds.On this, as on everything else, the eurozone leaders are divided.Hollande and others are in favour of giving Greece more time, while Merkel and others are opposed to any relaxation of the austerity measures.In reality, the only issue is timing: the debts piled on to Greece supposedly to provide a way out of its debt crisis, are unsustainable.Despite New Democracy‚Äôs narrow victory, there will be further explosive movements of the Greek working class and middle class against the barbaric austerity measures being imposed on the country.If the big four cannot reach agreement on crucial issues, there is no chance of the European Council coming up with solutions.The election of Hollande in France has strengthened the demand for less austerity and greater promotion of growth, still implacably opposed by Merkel and her allies.This deadlock means prolonged stagnation or another downturn, which in turn means continuous political and economic crisis.Capitalist leaders fear the breakup of the eurozone, which would have incalculable repercussions in Europe and throughout the world economy.But the contradictory forces bottled up in the eurozone are working in the direction of partial breakup, if not total breakup somewhere down the line.Gloomy global prospectsThe outlook for global capitalism is indeed gloomy.Since April/May this year there have been growing indications of a new downturn in the world economy.There are a number of overlapping and interrelated elements of crisis:The burden of debt: The high level of public and private debt and attempts to reduce debt (‚Äòdeleveraging‚Äô) is restricting the flow of credit and depressing consumer demand and investment.For the OECD area, government budget deficits averaged -2.1% during 1999-2008. In 2009 this shot up to -8.1% and is still currently -5.3%.The aggregate national debt for the OECD area has continued to increase, and is now 108.6% of GDP.Household debt (gross debt-to-disposable income) is also very high.For the euro area, for instance, the pre-boom level in 2000 was 85.3% but is now 107.9%.Company debt continues to be high.For non-financial companies (debt-to-GDP ratio) was 78.8% whereas it is now 96.8%.For financial corporations the debt ratio is even higher: it was 269.1% in 2000 and is now 381.7%.These figures are unsustainable on the basis of weak or completely stagnant growth, and carry the threat of increasing defaults in both the household and company sectors.Mass unemployment: Unemployment remains catastrophically high.This is an effect of the downturn, but reinforces it through weakened consumer demand, reduced tax revenues, and increased costs of unemployment benefits.In the EU (27 states) there are 24.6 million unemployed men and women, of whom 17.4 million are in the euro area (17).This is a jobless rate of 11% in the eurozone, 10% in the EU.In a number of countries the situation is much worse: in Spain the unemployment rate is 24.3%, in Greece 21.7%.Youth unemployment for both these countries is a catastrophic 50%.Global unemployment is a devastating indictment of capitalism.According to the ILO there are now 200 million jobless people internationally (up from 175 million in 2000).There are 75 million young people unemployed, an increase of four million since 2007.A joint ILO/OECD paper for the G20 summit in Mexico says ‚ÄúG20 countries would need to create 21 million jobs in 2012 in order to return to pre-crisis employment levels‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIf unemployment continues to grow at the current rate of 1.5%, it will be impossible to close the approximately 21 million jobs gap that has been accumulated across the G20 since the onset of the crisis in 2008‚Äù.(ILO press release, 16 May)The ILO director general warned (30 May) in coded language of the threat of a social explosion due to mass, long-term unemployment, especially of the youth.‚ÄúThe austerity-only course to fiscal consolidation is leading to economic stagnation, job loss, reduced [social] protection, and huge human costs, undermining those social values which Europe pioneered.While trying to reduce the public debt, unsuccessfully by the way, a social debt is building up that will also have to be paid‚Äù.Fiscal austerity: The policy of ‚Äòfiscal consolidation‚Äô, aiming at the short-term reduction of budget deficits and accumulated national debt through spending cuts and tax increases ‚Äì especially taxes like VAT which hit working-class consumers hardest ‚Äì is depressing growth, especially in Europe.‚ÄúFiscal austerity responses to deal with rising public debts are further deterring economic growth, which in turn is making a return to debt sustainability all the more difficult‚Äù.(UN Update, World Economic Situation and Prospects, mid-2012)The UN economists responsible for this report take a much more Keynesian view of the situation than most European leaders: ‚ÄúOn the fiscal front, the current policies in developed economies, especially in Europe, are heading into the wrong direction, driving the economies further into crisis and increasing the risk of renewed global downturn.The severe fiscal austerity programmes implemented in many European countries, combined with mildly contractionary policies in others such as Germany and France, carry the risk of creating a vicious downward spiral, with enormous economic and social costs. Under current conditions, characterised by weak private sector activity and poor investor and consumer confidence, simultaneous fiscal retrenchment across Europe has become self-defeating as massive public expenditure cuts will further push up unemployment, with negative effects on growth and fiscal revenue‚Äù.Bank crisis and continued credit squeeze: The banking crisis continues, with a recent sharp fall in bank lending.Following the 2008 financial sector crisis, the US banks were recapitalised (that is, their capital reserves were built up) through the government‚Äôs TARP programme, implemented in the dying days of the Bush regime and approved by Obama.This bailout provoked enormous public anger in the US, but largely stabilised the US banks.In Europe, on the other hand, the recapitalisation has been partial and patchy.The ECB has relieved many banks of a slice of their dodgy government bonds.Yet banks have been recently using cheap ECB credit (under the LTROs) to buy more risky government bonds.At the same time, under the new ‚ÄòBasel III‚Äô banking rules, the banks are forced to build up bigger capital reserves than in the past.They have also become wary of lending either to business or to other banks, and this has led to a recent tightening of the credit squeeze.According to a recent article in the International Herald Tribune (5 June), worldwide bank lending has plummeted: ‚ÄúInternational lending by global banks in the fourth quarter of last year fell by the largest amount since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, according to data released Monday by the Bank for International Settlements‚Ä¶ In total, financial firms cut foreign lending by $799 billion in the last three months of 2011‚Ä¶‚Äù Around 80% of the reduction came from the so-called interbank market where institutions lend money to one another.‚ÄúThe pull back in credit, particularly amongst banks themselves, is the latest effort by financial institutions to reduce exposure to the global economic slowdown.It also raises concerns that the unwillingness of banks to lend money to each other may have an effect on the broader economy, as businesses are unable to obtain new financing‚Äù.The Basel III rules are aimed at making banks more resilient to future financial crisis, but in the short run they are compounding the immediate problems faced by the financial sector.Big corporations hoard cash: While some companies (especially small and medium) are hit by the credit squeeze, big corporations internationally are hoarding cash rather than investing it in new productive capacity.In the UK, non-financial companies are estimated to be holding ¬£731.4 billion of cash reserves.In the eurozone, cash hoards are estimated at around ‚Ç¨2 trillion, while in the US non-financial companies hold more than $2 trillion in cash and other liquid assets.The big corporations evidently cannot find sufficient opportunities for profitable investment.This reflects a growing trend since the end of the post-war upswing (1950-73).(See: Corporate Cash Hoarders Stunt Growth, Socialism Today No.158, May 2012) Without investment by the major corporations, there will be no growth, the current stagnation will continue, and it will become increasingly difficult to reduce the burden of debt.The price of oil and geopolitical risk: The price of oil soared to around $140 a barrel on the eve of the 2008 financial crash and then plummeted in 2009-10.However, despite the stagnation of the world economy, the oil price rose 40% to reach an all-time high average yearly price of $111 a barrel in 2011, and rose even more in early 2012 (to around $120p/b).This was due to a combination of continued demand from China, Brazil, etc, on the one hand, and supply restrictions on the other, particularly due to sanctions against Iran.Since then, demand has slackened, and Opec has increased its output.Analysts at Credit Suisse recently predicted that the oil price could decline to around $50 a barrel this year.The decline in oil price has already resulted in a reduction of inflation.Oil prices also have a big effect on food prices, because of transport and fertiliser costs, etc.Other commodity prices have also declined because of weakening demand from China, which will hit commodity producers like Brazil, Australia, Canada, etc.However, sanctions against Syria, continued sanctions against Iran, and the possibility of further upheaval in the Middle East could push up oil prices again, even during a downturn.World trade: After recovering from a steep fall in 2009, world trade appeared to rebound in 2010.It grew in real terms at an average of 6.7% a year during 1999-2008, but plummeted to -10.7% in 2009.It recovered to 12.8% in 2010, but fell to 6% in 2011, and is only expected to grow by around 4% this year.The World Trade Organisation and other organisations are sounding alarms about creeping protectionism.In April, the WTO reported that since mid-October 2011, the G20 economies had added 124 new restrictive measures affecting about 1% of world imports.(Increase in Barriers to Trade, New York Times, 22 June) Global Trade Alert, an independent organisation, reports that ‚Äúprotectionist actions including tariff increases, export restrictions and skewed regulatory changes were much higher in 2010 and 2011 than previously thought, with many more in the pipeline‚Äù. (Protectionist Fears Highlighted, Financial Times, 14 June) ‚ÄúThe world trading system‚Äù, comments Global Trade Alert, ‚Äúdid not settle down to low levels of protectionism after the spike in beggar-thy-neighbour policies in 2009‚Äù.In a period of economic stagnation, or downswing, trade restrictions will become more and more prevalent, reinforcing economic stagnation.US recovery falters: The US is one of the few major economies to have surpassed its 2008 peak.The peak-to-trough fall was -5.1% and, at the beginning of this year, it was +1.2% above the previous peak.However, recovery has been very weak and uneven, particularly regarding unemployment.After growing 3% in 2010, growth fell to 1.7% in 2011 and is showing signs of petering out this year.Consumer spending, which accounts for around 70% of the US economy, has been hit by the enormous losses in household income suffered by millions of Americans.The Federal Reserve bank recently reported that ‚Äúthe median family‚Äôs net worth dropped 38.8% during the three-year period [2007-10]‚Ä¶ the biggest drop in net worth since the survey started in 1989‚Äù.The average American still earns less than six years ago, even allowing for inflation.(American Suffered Record Decline in Wealth, Reuters, 11 June)Recently, manufacturing activity has slowed down, particularly in capital goods, reflecting the decline in demand from Europe in particular, one of the US‚Äôs major markets.The weak US recovery, moreover, has been a ‚Äòjobless‚Äô recovery.There are officially 12.7 million unemployed workers in the US, with eight million part-time workers who really need full-time jobs.Growth in (non-farm) jobs averaged 226,000 in the first three months of 2012 but has slowed to 73,000 in the last two months.The dismal news of only 69,000 jobs being created in May was taken as a sign of renewed recession ‚Äì and led to a dip in world stock exchanges.China slows: The Chinese economy remained a locomotive of growth during the global downturn.Its average GDP growth during 2006-09 was 11.4% and remained at 10.4% during 2010.This was very largely due to the huge stimulus package implemented by the regime.It is estimated by Gary Shilling of Bloomberg that China‚Äôs stimulus package was the equivalent of 12% of GDP (compared with the US stimulus in 2009 of 6% of GDP).However, in the first quarter of this year, China‚Äôs growth fell to around 8% and is expected to slow even further this year.This partly reflects a tightening of credit by the regime last year to try to curb inflation, but it also reflects the beginnings of a sharp decline in the property bubble, and a decline in exports because of the slowing of the world economy.A slowdown in China would reduce its demand for commodities, leading to a general fall in commodity prices (already underway), which would especially hit commodity exporters such as Brazil, Australia, Canada, etc.Chinese government officials admit that official statistics underestimate the slowdown in output.Figures, for instance, for electricity demand, which is a proxy for output growth, indicate an even sharper slowdown.The Chinese regime has loosened its credit policy and indicated that there will be new stimulus measures.However, it is doubtful, given the huge debts accumulated on the basis of the last stimulus package, that it will be on the same scale as before.Moreover, this downturn coincides with the changeover in the top party leadership (and follows the Bo Xilai scandal).Reduced growth carries the threat of more intense political conflict within China, which could in turn undermine growth even more.This would have a profound effect on the global economy.European stagnation/crisis: The crisis in European capitalism has become a major factor in the trend towards global downturn this year.The EU countries are likely to tally zero growth this year, while the eurozone will experience negative growth (currently predicted by the UN at -0.3% but probably deeper).At the same time, the threat of a default by a major European country or the fracturing of the eurozone (for example, through a Greek default) has had a major effect on global financial markets. The decline in demand for the exports of major economies like the US and China has had a depressing effect on global output.The limits of monetary policy: In the absence of further stimulus policies (Obama‚Äôs proposals have been blocked by the Republican-dominated Congress) capitalist governments have relied on monetary policy, with low, near-zero interest rates and huge injections of credit into the system.This has mainly been done through the policy of ‚Äòquantitative easing‚Äô (QE), the contemporary equivalent of printing money, and various other ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô monetary measures.QE has been described as ‚Äòmonetary morphine‚Äô, a drug that eases the pain, becomes addictive, but fails to cure the underlying sickness.Ultra-expansionary monetary policy has failed to produce growth, but it has probably prevented the world economy from slipping into a major slump.However, the policy is subject to diminishing returns.The US Federal Reserve led the way with over $2.6 trillion-worth of QE, through buying US government bonds and other financial assets (such as securitised mortgages).However, the Fed has come under increasing attack from Republican ‚Äòinflation hawks‚Äô, who believe, contrary to current trends, that QE will lead to accelerated inflation.This is unlikely in the next period, given massive overcapacity in the global economy and the weakness of consumer and investment demand.Ben Bernanke, the head of the Fed, has hesitated to resort to more QE, preferring to rely on ‚ÄòOperation Twist‚Äô, the replacement of short-term US government bonds by long-term bonds, which is estimated to inject $267 billion into the economy through lowering interest rates.The continued slowdown of the economy and lower inflation, however, will almost certainly produce another round of QE in the US.The Bank of England has implemented ¬£325 billion of QE.As in the US, however, the bank has hesitated to introduce a new round.Instead, it has recently offered a package of cheap loans to banks (totalling ¬£100bn) on condition they increase their lending to businesses.No doubt, there will be more QE to come.The ECB has avoided the term quantitative easing, but nevertheless has implemented measures that are very similar: ‚Ç¨2 trillion of government bond purchases and cheap loans to banks (under the LTROs).However, the ECB has recently stopped buying eurozone government bonds in an effort to force the eurozone leaders to activate the two rescue funds, the EFSF and the new ESM.Expanding the money supply has been described as ‚Äòpushing on a piece of string‚Äô.If businesses are not prepared to invest and consumers have no money to buy, a looser money supply will not produce growth.This is admitted by Paul Tucker, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, who recently said: ‚ÄúQE has miserably failed to generate the sort of growth in broad money that the bank has said it was targeting back in 2009‚Äù.The massive expansion of central banks‚Äô balance sheets has failed to generate the sort of impact on broad money that could be expected.(Paul Tucker, On Why QE Isn‚Äôt Working, Financial Times, 13 June) Tucker advocates a broader monetary policy, which would include the Bank of England buying up financial assets (such as mortgages) that would pump money into businesses and households.A period of depressionWithout fully recovering from the 2007-09 slump, the world capitalist economy is sliding into a new downturn.This stagnation is symptomatic of a depression, not as deep or severe as the 1930s but, nevertheless, a period of weak investment and growth, mass unemployment and increased tension between capitalist rivals.The Financial Times columnist, Martin Wolf, describes it as a ‚Äúcontained depression‚Äù.(Panic Has Become All Too Rational, 5 June) ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù, he writes, ‚Äúforces for another downswing are building, above all in the eurozone.Meanwhile policymakers are making huge errors‚Äù.By this he means their insistence on savageausterity measures which stand in the way of recovery.Hollande‚Äôs modest proposals for a Keynesian-type stimulus package have been described as a ‚Äòfaux pas‚Äô by the Financial Times.His suggestion of higher taxes on big business and the wealthy have been met with howls of anguish.Capitalist leaders are in complete disarray.‚ÄúWhat would happen‚Äù, Wolf asks, ‚Äúif a country left the eurozone?Nobody knows.Might even Germany consider exit?Nobody knows.What is the long-run strategy for exit from the crises?Nobody knows.Given such uncertainty, panic is, alas, rational‚Ä¶ Before now, I had never really understood how the 1930s could happen.

181899.0," During the debate on the government statement, SGP leader Van der Staaij stood up for the purchasing power of families, especially those of single earners with children. Due to the accumulation of all kinds of measures and an unfair tax system, they are severely disadvantaged. <U+0091>healthcare<U+0092> also suffers disproportionately from the measures of <U+0091>Rutte 2<U+0092>. Another point of attention for the SGP is the <U+0091>pushy state<U+0092>. Citizens and entrepreneurs notice this due to an excess of (European) nuisance regulations. This pushiness also manifests itself in the violation of classical freedoms. Van der Staaij spoke in that context of <U+0091>spiritual leveling<U+0092>.¬†¬†The SGP paid special attention to the position of Israel and the many religious persecuted people in the world, especially in North Korea and Islamic countries. Debate on the government statement On a beautiful day in March this year, the SGP Youth Day was held. Indeed, Prime Minister Rutte was a guest. But a completely different politician was also present later in the day. There he is: Lodewijk Asscher, the new Deputy Prime Minister. The SGP youth are not only not ignorant, but also have a refined political sense. I don't want to brag <U+0096>, but in fact it is the SGP youth who have built the bridge for the Rutte-Asscher cabinet<U+0085>.¬†At the end of the youth day, Asscher took home the Oranje-Upperprijs. He received this for his efforts against the horrible abuses in the field of prostitution and human trafficking. I completely assume that Deputy Prime Minister Asscher will not let go of this theme now that his journey from Amsterdam to The Hague has been led. I ask the Prime Minister: what is the government going to do about these inhumane abuses? What will happen next with the bill that has been submitted to the Senate on this subject? In a speech on the SGP Youth Day, Asscher glowingly addressed the more than 1,600 SGP youth. Asscher presented the audience with Leviticus 19 verse 18: love your neighbor as yourself. According to him, these words should inspire a major adjustment of the policy of the Rutte 1 cabinet. I think he is now busy doing that as deputy Prime Minister of Rutte 2. Love your neighbor as yourself! It is indeed a very important assignment. In fact, it is the summary of all kinds of rules to guide society in the right direction. Love your neighbor as yourself!¬† The biblical commandments are certainly not intended to bother people, but rather to help them achieve their full potential. They protect people from the evil that threatens them. A good message at the start of a new cabinet! Standing up for fellow human beings in need inspires social care and service. Social policy must be solid. The government must curb greed and spare the vulnerable. Love enforced by the state is often not successful. First of all, it is about society itself, the citizens towards each other, having an eye for fellow human beings in need. I would like to hear more from the Prime Minister about this cabinet's vision on the future of the welfare state. And if he agrees that more is expected of society itself, what is the evidence for this? What specifically shows that the government really wants to encourage this? What does the volunteer, the informal caregiver, notice? Real social policy has a keen eye for the value of marriage and family. That is the place where children, if all goes well, are raised in love. There they also learn to love their neighbors. Investing time in the family and the interests of the child therefore deserves great appreciation. Seen in that light, imposing a job application requirement for single parents with young children is disastrous. Why does the government want to make divorces easier, but not focus on strengthening marriages? In that respect, an appeal in last Saturday's Volkskrant Magazine struck my heart: <U+0093>No break-ups! Let's talk!<U+0094>¬†The purchasing power of families is under severe pressure. The accumulation of tax measures, child benefit reductions, paying for school books and the social loan system still leads to significant purchasing power effects. The adjustment of the coalition agreement is an improvement, but single-income families with several children still end up in a significant negative position. This is on top of the disproportionately high tax burden that single-income households already have compared to the same family income of two-income households. That's unfair! Middle-income households in particular are having a hard time. We are concerned about the consequences of the accumulation of healthcare measures. The abolition of the tax deduction for medical expenses, increasing personal contributions and no longer reimbursing domestic help will have a major impact on many chronically ill and disabled people. The SGP wants to know how the cabinet prevents people from being disproportionately affected by this. Your neighbor is not just the person you meet in your own circle or field of vision. Social policy, loving your neighbor as yourself, also means having an eye for the poor far away and for the stranger.¬†That is why my group is against ¬†the easy cuts in development cooperation. More effective use of aid funds: fine. Promoting self-reliance: excellent. But it is unpalatable if the cuts lead to the destruction of capital and the cancellation of well-running projects. Real love requires lasting commitment and thoughtful action, not about being driven by feelings. Mercy that is based solely on emotions degenerates into soft-heartedness. It is good to also keep this in mind in the field of immigration policy. Charity means having an eye for people in need, offering help to people who are persecuted. There must be and remain ample space for this. But: a well-thought-out policy with room for customization is required, not the emotions of the moment should be leading. The SGP finds it unbelievable that a pardon is being issued for the umpteenth time. ¬†Love your neighbor as yourself. That means looking further than your nose. Also pay attention to the interests of your children and grandchildren. Solidarity between generations, between young and old, is under pressure. To what extent is it guaranteed that today's young people can still build up a reasonable pension? MdV, this new cabinet has taken office in difficult times, a time of crisis. Both parties interpreted the election results without complaint as a condemnation of each other. Decisions were made quickly. But the haste was not good. A not-unfamous honorary member of the VVD, Mr Wiegel, said the following words: <U+0093>I have the impression that the cabinet has already been significantly damaged by its own actions before it has started . The question is whether it will ever gain the authority that a government desperately needs in these difficult times.<U+0094>Mr Wiegel did not speak these ominous and prophetic words about this cabinet, but on November 17, 1981, at the debate on the government statement of the Van Agt-Den Uyl cabinet<U+0085>.¬†The pressing question is real: will this cabinet be able to gain sufficient authority to implement painful measures? Waiving the healthcare tax is a gain. But that does not mean we are cheering on the new plans. This still means that many people will have to pay more taxes (58% instead of 52%), and a larger share than before of extra earned money must be deposited into the state treasury. This is at odds with the principle that work must pay. Painful measures to get the state treasury back in order are unavoidable. And it is only fair that people who are already in dire straits are spared. But things go wrong when leveling is turned into a party, becoming a goal in itself. The SGP opposes this. For the affordability of healthy social policy, it is important that money is also earned. After all, money trees still don't grow there. That is why economically decisive policy is needed. Do not hinder activity. Not with extra charges, but also not with extra rules. There is a threat of increased charges for entrepreneurs. I specifically draw attention to agriculture and horticulture. Many investments are required: in animal welfare, compliance with environmental regulations. Costs are going up, but prices are going down. This is of course how you bring this top sector down! It is a bad thing that valuable agricultural land is ultimately given up to turbid Scheldt water. Moreover, isn't this the end of the road for further depoldering? The new cabinet wants a significant reduction in the regulatory burden. Beautiful. Every new cabinet starts with that good intention. But what will really happen? The crucial question is: does the government really want to offer space to schools, companies and fellow authorities? Is it prepared to take the course towards less state and more society? Providing more space for professionalism, for enthusiasm, for the creativity of the teacher, for the entrepreneur. This requires a well-considered choice against centralism and dirigisme in The Hague and for an increase in the state-free space for citizens! The SGP sees nothing at all in the bullshit that the cabinet is guided by in public administration.¬† Governance comes further from the citizen, economies of scale are forced on autonomous co-governments. While research shows that it is even counterproductive financially! Many rules now come from Europe. What options does the cabinet see for less Brussels nuisance power? The coalition agreement also states that the Netherlands will strengthen the European Union and the euro, but not at any price. Mr President, that is a nice platitude, but the question is of course: what does that <U+0093>not at any price<U+0094>¬† mean in concrete terms. What price is the cabinet not willing to pay? The cabinet started on the basis of a thick coalition agreement. But that does not settle everything. How the blank spots are filled in is important in all kinds of areas. Take, for example, the commitment to help those persecuted by religion worldwide: will the government continue to advocate for this? In the passage about the Middle East, we lack the commitment to further strengthen ties with Israel. Will the government make a case for this? We would very much welcome that. MdV, I started with the story of the SGP Youth Day. The SGP members also expressly seek dialogue with people who think differently. There is ¬†a lot of concern here today about financial leveling. We are also seriously concerned about spiritual leveling. Everyone is in danger of being squeezed into a secular straitjacket. The freedom to give substance to views that deviate from the controversial majority is decreasing. Unfortunately, this is also reflected in this coalition agreement: gnawing at the freedom of education by tinkering with the admission policy and appointment policy, restricting rights for conscientious objectors to wedding officials.¬† Bridges are not being built here, they are being picked up!¬†Love your neighbor as yourself, was the text from Leviticus 19. But there is something else in the same text: I am the Lord! Love of neighbor is inextricably linked to love of God. A policy that serves everyone requires that justice be done to Biblical values. Standing up for vulnerable lives, caring for those who have no voice, also means for us a commitment to greater protection of unborn life. The cabinet is avoiding a discussion about the abortion term in advance. Why? The SGP does not accept this and will continue to seek debate on this matter. The same chapter from Leviticus also contains the call to honor the day of rest. It would be good if the Minister of Social Affairs, and with him the entire cabinet, would also pay attention to this! The call to love one's neighbor is not only stated in the law of Moses, but it is a common thread throughout the Bible. In the Gospels it is recorded that Christ Himself said: the first and great commandment is to love God above all things, and the second, like it, is to love our neighbor as ourselves. Thus love and commandment remain, as they should be, close together. Imitators of Christ are not moralists and know-it-alls. True imitators are people who, touched by God's love, only find support in the message of salvation and salvation for people who have no reason to beat themselves up. We hope and pray that the new cabinet will be guided and inspired. by the desire to serve this country with love.

161829.0," Tiny Kox ""We have finally got the PvdA to the point that the rich have to pay a little more tax, and then the Telegraaf reports that with a higher rate for the rich the 'common man is caught'. Nothing wrong with a right-wing newspaper, but with crooked talk!"" This is what SP campaign leader Tiny Kox said in response to the Telegraaf's reporting today. Kox is struck by how the Telegraaf, one of the largest newspapers in the Netherlands, takes a very easy approach to the truth: ""I understand that the editors find it annoying that the PvdA is now following our example with stricter tax measures against rich people and also wants to get rid of villa subsidies through the mortgage interest deduction. But let them write that: SP is pulling PvdA to the left, or something like that. Now the Telegraaf is misleading people. The real truth is that the PvdA's plans go less far than ours. but are better for ordinary people than what CDA and VVD put on the table. And another truth: the PvdA is usually better at promising than delivering. Think again of their 2006 program: We would not get an increase in the state pension age and a referendum on the new European Treaty. Let the Telegraaf point this out, then they have a real point.

183159.0," Serious threats are being made against Geert Wilders by the extremist Muslim organization Sharia4Holland, which strives for the introduction of Islamic law in the Netherlands and Belgium.Click here for the full message on Telegraaf.nlClick here for the parliamentary questions from members Wilders and Van Klaveren (PVV) about this. Wilders is threatened with the same fate as Theo van Gogh, who was gruesomely killed by the Muslim extremist Mohammed Bouyeri. ‚ÄúWilders, don't you think that there will be a Muslim who will one day get tired of your bullshit and do what Mohammed Bouyeri did?‚Äù predicts the radical leader Abu Imran of Sharia4Holland. Geert Wilders was informed yesterday afternoon by the National Coordinator Counterterrorism (NCTb) about these explicit threats. NCTb spokesperson Edmond Messchaert: ‚ÄúStatements like these are taken into account in the threat assessment. If necessary, the protective measures will be adjusted, but we never comment on the nature and extent of the measures.‚Äù ShockedGeert Wilders reacts shocked to the images. ‚ÄúIt's disgusting, beyond wrong. It is clear what he is after. This is incitement to violence against me.‚Äù The PVV leader says he will press charges for threats. When asked whether he thinks the video should be removed from the internet, Wilders says: ‚ÄúThe video banned? That man should be banned!‚Äù In two chilling video speeches, each about nine minutes long, which are on the Sharia4Holland YouTube channel, the hate preacher Imran calls Geert Wilders a cursed, unbelieving dog. In a lengthy supplication, he asks Allah to pour out ‚Äúall the sickness on earth‚Äù on the politician. He also asks Allag to ‚Äúturn his health into illness and his wealth into poverty.‚Äù ‚ÄúMay he receive all the shame, problems and disasters that can happen to a person in life.‚Äù The threats against Wilders are a response to Wilders' announcement that he will be releasing Fitna-2 next year, in which he ‚Äúexplores the barbaric life of wants to expose the sick mind of Mohammed‚Äù. The PVV leader says he wants to offer support to Muslims worldwide to leave Islam with his new film. According to Wilders, ex-Muslims, 'apostates', are heroes who deserve support: ""It is time that we help these people by unmasking Mohammed."" 'Cursed coward' Sharia4Holland leader Abu Imran believes that Wilders is crossing the line with this: "" How dare he speak negatively about the prophet, who had the best character imaginable, was the most noble person, with the highest status, who enjoyed enormous respect during his life?‚Äù The Muslim extremists challenge Wilders to a public debate. ‚ÄúOh, you damned coward, be a man who does not curse from behind the police and state security, but come and sit at the table with us for a debate.‚Äù The extremist, who sits in front of the camera with what appears to be a shoulder holster, says are on the ‚Äúdomination of the world.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will not stop until our plan comes true. We will conquer the Netherlands, like Belgium and the rest of the European countries. We will drive the Zionists, the descendants of monkeys and pigs, out of Palestine. They will wipe Israel off the map. Do you really think your Zionist friends will support you, you damned dog?‚Äù Earlier, Abu Imran preached on a video in combat clothing, in which automatic gunfire and the loading of automatic weapons could be heard in the background. Increasingly radicalThe hate preacher, who posts increasingly radical, Dutch-language videos on the internet, predicts Wilders the same fate as the English former minister Stephen Timms, who was stabbed on the street in East London by a Muslim woman who tried to kill him. ‚ÄúDo you really think you will never encounter a Muslim woman or man who suddenly appears out of nowhere? Do you really think that you will always be protected? This is not a threat, but a warning. Be realistic: what you sow, you will reap.‚Äù Imran further speaks in the video about ‚Äúcleansing the earth of these types of people‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroying Wilders‚Äù. At the end of the message he once again addresses Wilders directly: ‚ÄúYou have a choice: an open debate with us, with all the media, you can even call in the entire Dutch army if you fear for your safety. You can choose the location yourself, even the prison in Vught or an army barracks. Leave the Muslims alone. Live as an unbeliever, as a dog, eventually you will go to hell. Or you are welcome to become a Muslim, as a brother in the faith. If not, you must be ready for the consequences."" Serious indication. According to a jihad expert within the intelligence world, the offer to convert is a serious indication that there are plans to do something to the politician. ‚ÄúThe Koran states that anyone who is going to attack you, an individual or a country or region, must warn you in advance, usually two months, that you are going to attack and that they will be given time to repent. Osama bin Laden did this two months before '9/11', the warning was given two months before the attacks in London and the attacks in Madrid.

181918.0," The House of Representatives too easily ignores classical fundamental rights. This was said by SGP MP Bisschop during the Home Affairs budget discussion. He mentioned the discussion about civil servants with conscientious objections. The House included sound advice from the Council of State with the old paper. Bishop also referred to ritual slaughter, in which the House of Representatives was reprimanded by the Senate: <U+0093>Assessment of fundamental rights should not be a ritual, but is one of the most important tasks of parliament.<U+0094 >Home Affairs BudgetR. Bishop December 18, 2012¬†Freedom of conscience can be regarded as the general mother right, which has been absorbed by its children, the more specific fundamental rights.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Statement for thesis B.P. Vermeulen¬†¬†Chairman, The coalition agreement is a uniform model in the field of Home Affairs. Under the guise of tolerance, a suffocating blanket of equality is being rolled out over the Netherlands. Equality apparently takes precedence over freedom for this cabinet. Whenever there are discussions in the House of Representatives about themes in which fundamental rights are at stake, it is exciting to see how the House will deal with this. This spring we needed the Senate to correct the House of Representatives in the debate on ritual slaughter. One-sided emphasis on suffering that would happen to animals meant that religious freedom was easily set aside. Another discussion: conscientious objectors to wedding officials. The Council of State has provided wise and thorough advice on this. The House hardly appears to be seriously considering the advice. Substantial problems of conscience among civil servants are simply ignored. The frequently used disapproving terminology says enough: the House does not actually take the freedom to act according to its own conscience seriously. There are many ideas to bind their conscience. This should not occur in a constitutional state. Yet we see this binding of conscience reflected in the strange proposals in the coalition agreement indicated with the swear word <U+0091>refuse civil servants<U+0092> and the General Equal Treatment Act. Freedom should be central there. Will the government itself come up with initiatives? If we here in the House want to take our Constitution and fundamental rights seriously <U+0096> and we have all solemnly promised this by oath or promise <U+0096> then, in my opinion, we must take serious action of the assessment of laws against fundamental rights. It should not be our feelings about other people's views that should guide us, but a serious assessment framework. Assessment of fundamental rights should not be a ritual, but one of the most important responsibilities of our parliament. We should not leave this to the Senate alone. In a recent issue of the magazine Regelmaat, extensive attention is drawn to these types of matters. The SGP asks the minister to follow the advice of immediately taking this constitutional review into account in all bills. And to pay close attention to this with other ministers as well. Levels of government We have three official levels of government in our country: central government, province and municipality. The SGP is critical of all kinds of aid structures that have been placed in between. Does the Netherlands really benefit from regional implementation services, the Randstad Authority, the North and South Wings and the like? Why are we talking for the umpteenth time about structural revisions instead of about the content? We see the same unity template again when dealing with provinces and municipalities. The coalition agreement contains few meaningful proposals about provincial scaling up. According to the SGP, bringing the residents of Rhenen and Texel together in one part of the country will not solve any administrative problem. Moreover, the proposal for parts of the country causes a historical break. It would be even more justifiable if the government proposed to abolish the States General[1] than to abolish the provinces, where citizens <U+0096> think, for example, of Zeeland, Friesland, Limburg <U+ 0096> often have a strong bond with it. Without categorically ruling out changes in the municipal scale, the SGP cannot imagine the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã<U+0091>big is good<U+0092> at the municipal level. Scaling up to municipalities with 100,000 or more inhabitants only brings local government further away from the citizens. Will municipalities also receive the corresponding expansion of local taxation at the expense of national taxes with the additional tasks? How can we prevent the intended customization and increased citizen involvement from being completely undermined? The water boards in the Netherlands have old and solid credentials. The SGP believes that water boards have proven their worth. The fewest possible political bodies should remain there as much as possible. What does the government want to achieve by removing the water boards from the Constitution? Does this government recognize the continued importance of these administrative bodies? We also regularly see that national standards are set that are detrimental to rural municipalities. What role does this minister see for himself in correcting his colleagues on this point if necessary? Consider, for example, healthcare or education or police strength. There are major cuts to the AIVD. The SGP believes it is important to gather its own intelligence about the threat assessment for, for example, terrorism or Salafist influences in the Netherlands. The government wants to abolish the foreign task completely. How can this be prevented from being at the expense of Dutch security <U+0096>, especially in the light of the equally significant cuts in Defense? Finally, a point regarding the commemoration of 4 and 5 May. Last year, colleague Van der Staaij submitted a motion that explicit attention should be paid to the horrors of the Holocaust. The subsidy conditions are now limited to <U+0092>promoting knowledge and debate about democracy and citizenship<U+0092>[2]. Certainly not the first things that come to mind when commemorating the Second World War. We call on the minister to specifically mention this theme in the subsidy conditions and not to leave this solely to the Ministry of Education.¬†[1] Although it is a good thing that the government is withdrawing the proposals for the reduction of the States General.[2] Budget 2013, page 50 ",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text does not claim that state institutions irrationally favor any particular group.

165049.0," Harry van Bommel SP MP Harry van Bommel is very unhappy with the candidacy of Minister of Finance Dijsselbloem for the position of President of the Eurogroup. He fears that the Netherlands' options for tough negotiations in Brussels will be seriously weakened: 'It will be a lot more difficult for him to hold his ground if he simultaneously has to reach a compromise as chairman. His appointment leads to less room for maneuver for the Netherlands in the European negotiating game. This candidacy is therefore at odds with Dutch interests.' Van Bommel points to the desire to reduce the Dutch contribution to the EU or the possible need to argue for a more flexible use of European budget rules in the future. Van Bommel also wonders whether Minister Dijsselbloem will still be able to properly perform his position as Minister of Finance. Van Bommel: 'The current chairman of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, says he spends almost four hours a day on his work as chairman. He can only do that because he has been doing it for seven years and comes from a small country that is also relatively unaffected by crisis. It is incomprehensible that Minister Dijsselbloem believes that now is a suitable time to accept a part-time job in addition to being a minister.' If it were up to the SP, the appointment of Minister Dijsselbloem as chairman of the Eurogroup will not go ahead. The party wants a debate with the minister in the short term to clarify the reasons why he is considering accepting this chairmanship.

183625.0," In a video posted online today, Geert Wilders calls on Mark Rutte to stop supporting the candidacy of the Belgian Guy Verhofstadt for the presidency of the European Commission.

183579.0," Madam Chairman, The demolition continues. Leveling continues. Tax increases continue. The discontinuation of unemployment benefits continues. The relaxation of dismissal law continues. The billions in cuts to healthcare continue as usual. The Netherlands has made absolutely no progress with this agreement. Click here to view Geert Wilders' input on Dumpert.nl Also read the message ""Wilders cracks budget agreement"" on NU.nl Also read the message ""Wilders cracks ""crematorium agreement"" on Telegraaf.nl The only thing new is that the cabinet has given the helm to His Vanity, Mr. Pechtold. He is now the new captain of the ship whether that is a good idea: someone as a captain on a ship who spends all day admiring himself in the mirror. On Friday we saw a sad backdrop for the presentation of a sad agreement. Men in black suits in a black room There was coffee and cake. The crematorium agreement. The next room was the Netherlands. The worst part is the lies. It's crazy. Taxes will be increased by almost 8 billion next year. 8 billion euros in tax increases in 1 year! The Netherlands is being taxed to pieces, even with this crap agreement. The government is behaving like a kind of pickpocket that steals 1,000 euros from you, but gives you ten euros back. The cabinet believes that we should say 'thank you' for that tenner. But the Dutch are not crazy. The agreement with the fake opposition does not reverse the catastrophic policy of Rutte II. The changes are rumblings in the margins. One party gets some education and green nonsense, the other something for families with children. In the meantime, Prime Minister Rutte can continue to implement 99 percent of his disastrous agenda. With the tax increases, with the leveling, with the dismantling of healthcare, with the unbridled flow of money to Brussels and Africa that continues as usual. It only gets worse. The purchasing power of our elderly is only becoming more dramatic. Even the tap water is now under greater strain. Now I suddenly understand why Mr. Pechtold takes a bath every day in donkey milk and not in water. What else will the government come up with to meet Brussels' demands next year? A daylight tax perhaps? Or a sun hour tax? Will we have a tax on breathing air? As long as there is no mirror tax, because then our friends from D66 will go bankrupt. The flunky opposition keeps the most disastrous cabinet of all time in the saddle, and makes itself complicit in destroying the Netherlands for a few peanuts. They get nothing, except their 15 minutes in the sun. Q: My group is wondering what crisis was actually resolved last week? At least not an economic crisis. For most Dutch people, the misery continues as usual. Will there be more jobs created? With trumpets and horns the big news was delivered: 50,000 new jobs! Everyone would go back to work. But when someone started reading the small print, it turned out to be 50,000 jobs in 2040, when Mr Rutte is 98. Ex, it is a fake agreement. It's a fake opposition. They are fake numbers. It's a fake success. It is a botox agreement. What is realistic is that 70,000 people will become unemployed again in the coming year. Today again 700 people went to the WW. Today, 50 companies are again bankrupt. What is real: the motorist has become the cash cow as usual. Motor vehicle tax, BPM, diesel, LPG. The hardworking Dutch middle class everywhere has to pay. Anyone who goes to work by car is screwed, anyone who visits the family on Sunday is screwed, and anyone who drives their children's football team pays for it. The purpose of this agreement is therefore not to solve the economic crisis, but preventing a government crisis. That plush is so comfortable. The lack of leadership, the lack of vision, the lack of trust. That is the crisis in the Netherlands. And no agreement with the fake opposition will solve that. And things can be different. Things can be different if we choose a free and independent Netherlands. Things can be different if we choose growth, prosperity, hope and ambition. Things can be different if we opt for tax cuts instead of tax increases. And if we pay for that tax cut by no longer throwing billions of euros into bottomless pits abroad, from Africa to Bulgaria and Brussels, from Greece to Cyprus. If we stop pumping billions into wind turbines and money for environmental crazies, things can be different. And it must be different. It is time to put the interests of the Netherlands first. It is time for a cabinet with vision. The Netherlands longs for a Prime Minister with vision. It is time for a Prime Minister with a broader ambition than preventing his own dismissal. It is time to choose the Netherlands.

182076.0," Dear party members, municipal elections During the municipal elections, many people put their trust in the SGP. We already saw gains in the previous municipal elections. Now again. A wonderful plus, both in our independent lists and in the combined factions with the Christian Union. The SGP is now the largest party in fifteen places.¬†There was a wonderful gain in votes and seats in Ede, in Urk, on the Utrechtse Heuvelrug, and I could go on and on. From scratch, the SGP entered the council in Vlissingen and Bunschoten. In Bunschoten even with two seats at the same time. In short: that good result is a reason for deep gratitude. For this we are grateful to the Lord God.¬†We are happy with the loyalty of the many people who previously entrusted their vote to the SGP. But good news is also the support of new voters. Whether you speak to Jan-Bert Heinen from Bunschoten, to Gerrit Boonzaadjer from the Utrechtse Heuvelrug, or to Breunis van de Weerd from Ede - they have all also spoken to people who said: <U+0093>we do not share all your principles , but you would like to place your trust in us. You know what the SGP can do for you.<U+0094>It would be good if the SGP were allowed to bear administrative responsibility again in many places. We are a party with a strong tradition of not shouting from the sidelines without obligation, but of putting our shoulders to the wheel wherever possible. Taking responsibility: budget agreements Based on the same sense of responsibility, we have also played an unexpected role in The Hague in recent times. in the agreements to put public finances in order <U+0096> the housing agreement, the budget agreements, the pension agreement.¬†We were not eagerly awaiting this. After all, it requires shared responsibility for unpleasant measures that are necessary to make the sick public finances healthy again. It also means a constructive attitude towards a government that pursues a policy that is not ours on many points. .¬†It also includes, after the CDA unfortunately dropped out, cooperation with parties such as D66, from which we are miles apart on quite a few intangible issues.¬†Nevertheless, we have contributed to the agreements with conviction. As SGP, we see it as our duty to prevent political instability and indecision. With five elections in ten years, too much has been left undone, too much uncertainty and ambiguity have arisen. That harms the national interest. We did not want it to be on our conscience that the early economic recovery would fail due to a lack of decisiveness in The Hague. This constructive attitude also does justice to Biblical notions of seeking peace in the city, about which Jeremiah speaks in the letter to the exiles in Babylon. If so many churches pray on Sunday that the cabinet will make the right decisions, won't we do what we can on Monday to help out? This special situation also creates opportunities to make concessions without making any fundamental concessions. to achieve important points from our election manifesto. We have recently noticed that this choice is well understood by those who support our party. We sense broad confidence within the party that both Senator Holdijk in the Senate and our House of Representatives faction are doing everything they can to exert a good influence. We are grateful for that trust. We are pleased to see a lot of appreciation for our contribution to foiling the child benefit attack. This material support is in line with our principled choice to support families <U+0096>, waiving the labor obligation for single mothers is also an example of this. The extra effort to support informal caregivers has also been positively noticed. And not to mention: it is also gratifying that, supported by the Christian Union, we were able to make extra money available for the care of unwanted pregnant women, for the exit program <U+0092 >s for ex-prostitutes and for the enforcement of the small school allowance. We have no illusion that we can change the world with our foot in the door. But you can trust that we will continue to do our best to seize the opportunities we see to advance good and counter evil. We do this in the realization that ultimately we are not a party of power, but a party of strength: we believe in the power of the Word. The SGP has not only contributed to the agreements with conviction, but we are also prepared to continue on this path. The government parties VVD and PvdA suffered significant blows in the municipal elections <U+0096>, which is no reason to stop striving for a broader support base for policy, but rather an encouragement for this. Our priorities are clear: consistently working on reducing the budget deficit, taking advantage of opportunities to strengthen the economic strength of the Netherlands, strengthening the purchasing power position of families with growing children, in particular single-income families. Speaking of purchasing power: we believe it is important that healthcare reforms do not lead to an increase in burdens, even for middle incomes. Extra money for defense is also high on our wish list. We are pleased that, after years of cutting and hacking away, we have managed to structurally free up tens of millions more for the entire Defense organization. This trend break must be continued. I would like to repeat the words to the commander of the armed forces at the very successful SGP Youth Day: <U+0093>let it be a turning point<U+0094>!¬†It is naive to think that the world has become a safer place. Look at the Arab world, look at the land grab in Crimea.¬† We don't want a future where the brutal have half the world. That's why I say: hands off Defense, invest more in our security! <U+0093>Freedom isn<U+0092>t free.<U+0094>We have no agreement on immaterial issues. The parties are too different for that. But we do expect the cabinet and the coalition parties that when we stick our neck out and lend a hand on budget agreements, they will not needlessly step on our toes on immaterial issues. Poldering does not go hand in hand with polarization. Just two examples: we were happy with the recent support for our motion that asks the cabinet to encourage trade with Israel in a convincing and visible manner. The SGP is also happy with the steps that are being taken. In response to the Holdijk motion <U+0096>, the government has reached out to retailers who want to keep their businesses closed on Sundays.¬†dissatisfaction with EuropeThe gap between citizens and Europe is great. We must take that dissatisfaction seriously. This can be done by making the right choice during the elections for the European Parliament. Our man in Brussels, Bas Belder, has always followed a clear course: no overconfident European tower construction. Give practical and down-to-earth form to collaboration. That is also the message of the CU-SGP list. We count on your support in the elections of D.V. May 22!¬†Returning trust The government can regain trust by not only taking back powers from Europe, but also returning more trust to society.<U+0093>Keep the government off your property! <U+0093> Rev. Kersten made this powerful appeal in his party speech of 1935. A few years later he said: <U+0093> I repeat and let it sound from thousands of mouths throughout the country: Keep the government from your property and does not do this by beating around the bush, but by voting for the candidates of the Political Reformed Party. They have tirelessly advocated for the rights and freedoms of our Dutch people, so terribly despised.<U+0094>The SGP now, almost eighty years later, stands for more society and less state. Everything nowadays is rigid with rules and protocols and tests. Do you think it is normal that when a whale washes ashore, a sperm whale protocol is immediately drawn up? That rule slush is nothing other than solidified distrust. We want to offer more space to entrepreneurs. We want to give more freedom to teachers in the classroom. Providing more space for your hands at the hospital bed. ¬†Healthcare workers must feel encouraged and challenged, and not tied hand and foot to protocols and checklists. More society, less state. That is a spearhead for us. That is why we have<U+0091>rolled out a red carpet for construction<U+0092> to remove rules and speed up procedures, to support construction.That is why Roelof Bishop submitted an initiative proposal to carefully delineate the tasks of the education inspectorate.¬†healthcareImportant reforms in the field of healthcare are in the pipeline. A lot ends up on the municipality's plate: youth care, support for the elderly and people with disabilities. We support the movement to provide tailor-made care and support closer to the citizen. offer. But there is more to it than a task transfer. It is also about a cultural change. And there is also a cut involved. More is expected of society itself, a greater demand is made for self-reliance and care for each other. There are still some important gaps in the new Social Support Act that the SGP wants to close. A hard point for us is that the citizen can stay opting for identity-related care, so that, for example, someone with an intellectual disability can go to daytime activities that match their Christian identity. Greater efforts are needed to support volunteers and informal caregivers, and to actively involve churches and social organizations.¬†Trust within the partyTrust is a key word between citizens and government, but also an indispensable cement within the party. Trust is necessary for us to always find the right balance between testifying politics and practical politics, as two sides of the same SGP coin. Practical politics often attract more attention, but we attach great importance to also testifying in words. We in the SGP agree on much, very much. We find each other on the basis of God's Word. But sometimes we do not all agree on the elaboration and application of the Biblical notions. The long-standing discussion about the scope of women's political involvement in our party is a clear example of this. Then it comes down to dealing wisely with differences in viewpoints. That is not new. Already at the beginning of our party history, we saw that people thought and acted differently about women going to the polls. There were women at that time who went to jail in prayer because they refused to vote, and there were women who went to the polls in prayer and voted boldly.¬†Let us hold each other in confidence, even when there are differences.¬†Trust in GodI will come to a conclusion. We live in a time of many changes. Of drastic changes. There are hopeful developments. But there are also sad developments. We would very much like to see progress in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãprotecting unborn life. And what an enrichment it would be to strengthen marriage and the family! Our loud objection to the bizarre adultery site that encourages infidelity received little attention in the House of Representatives, but the broad support we received from the whole of society was encouraging. Let us not be intimidated by living as if there is no God < U+0096> The opposite is true. Christ has already won the victory with His suffering and death and resurrection. Through all storms, His Kingdom breaks forth. Buildings can look impressive. But when the driving rain comes down, the house may eventually collapse. Because it is built on sandThe wise builder does better. He builds the house on the rock. By God's grace let us build our house on the rock. Loving God above all else, caring lovingly for our neighbors. That house remains standing. Because the foundation is so good, because Christ Himself is the rock.¬†God says to us: don't trust people, but trust Me. Do not hold on to human wisdom, but to My Word. Then even in the atrocities in Syria, or from the prison camps of North Korea, in the midst of all darkness, light can break through, and a stammer can be heard:<U+0093>Al even if I go into the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff they comfort me.<U+0094>",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes operational shortcomings, not suggesting state institutions favor a particular group.

174447.0," The Green parties in Europe reject the transatlantic free trade agenda. They decided this unanimously on Saturday during the election convention of the European Green Party in Brussels. During the upcoming European election campaign, GroenLinks and its sister parties will stand up for the European values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are in danger of being undermined by the proposed trade agreement with the United States: environmental protection, food safety, social rights, democracy and privacy. ""The European Union leads the world in protecting people and the environment. These relatively high European standards form part of our economic strength: they challenge companies to innovate,"" says Bas Eickhout, leader of GroenLinks in the European elections. . ""It serves neither citizens nor companies if we sacrifice these standards on the altar of free trade."" The European Greens oppose, among other things, the proposals of European Commissioner Karel de Gucht (Trade) for regulatory cooperation. This would give American business lobbies influence on European bills before they are made public. The Greens also reject the proposals for additional investor protection (ISDS).

163709.0," Left bloc beats Danish right Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen among her party members from the Enhedslisten: 'Pulling the government to the left.' On September 15, there were elections in Denmark, the country that has had a right-wing government for ten years with the support of a PVV party. like party, the Danish People's Party. At the end of the evening there was a celebration in the left camp: the right was defeated. text and photo: Diederik Olders A country in which a liberal VVD-like party has the name 'Links' (Venstre) and the D66-like party is called 'Radicaal Links' (Det Radikale Venstre): that does not bode well for the chances of really left-wing parties. When the Danish People's Party - an anti-immigration party to which Geert Wilders feels strongly connected - became the third party in the country in 2001, a right-wing tolerance construction was introduced in Denmark that we now also know in the Netherlands. Ten dark years of right-wing destruction policies, combined with strict anti-immigration laws, began. For example, proposals are made without batting an eyelid to abolish the minimum wage for guest workers. Falling in love with a non-Dane means that if you are younger than 24, you are not allowed to settle together in Denmark. Many young couples therefore had to move to just across the border in Sweden or Germany, and drive back and forth for their work - which is still in Denmark. The long bridge between Copenhagen and Malm√∂ in Sweden has since been called the 'Love Bridge'. However, there are indeed left-wing parties in Denmark. Until ten years ago, the social democrats (a kind of PvdA) played a major role in all governments. There are two parties with which the SP feels connected. The oldest is the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti, SF). In the 1990s they were already tolerating partners of governments led by the Social Democrats. When Villy S√∏vndal took over as party leader in 2005, the SF began to grow. S√∏vndal's message was: make us great, because we want a left-wing government with the social democrats. That message caught on and in 2007 the party doubled its seats to 23 of the 179 seats in the Folketing, the Danish parliament. The other socialist party is the Enhedslisten, the Red-Green Alliance. The history of the Enhedslisten is comparable to Groenlinks (founded in the late 1980s from a number of left-wing parties), but although the party clearly profiles itself on sustainability and greenery, socio-economically it follows a much more left-wing course than GroenLinks. The party has no political leader, but a committee. A few years ago it was decided to appoint a 'spokesman' who could serve as the face of the party: 27-year-old Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen. The Enhedslisten has never been very big in parliament. Before the September elections, the Enhedslisten had 4 seats. In 2007, after the SF's election win, the party decided to take its message ‚Äì vote for a left-wing government ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãseriously. Rasmus Meyer is a campaign strategist for the SF and has experienced Barack Obama's campaign in the US from the inside. He talks about the strategy: 'Our message was: vote for us if you want change. To make this visible, we have made plans together with other left-wing parties and the trade unions. To make it clear what the alternative is. That meant we had to make compromises in advance. The most painful compromises were precisely in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãanti-immigration issues. We found that we could not win in campaigns against the easy anti-immigration positions of the right. For example, the Enhedslisten lost a lot of support in 2007 because an outspoken Muslim woman was on their list. We tried to make the campaign about socio-economic issues. But first the immigration discussion had to be off the table. We have opted for far-reaching compromises with the Social Democrats, who are much further to the right than us on this issue. The message was: we are also strict, so let's talk about really important matters.' The strategy worked. Indeed, the campaign was not about immigration, but about the economy. And it was precisely there that the 'left bloc' had a joint plan, which made it very convincing that jobs could be created in the sustainable sector, especially in times of crisis. Christian Juhl is a trade unionist at 3F, the largest Danish trade union, and is high on the Enhedslisten list. According to him, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa 'left bloc' has worked well: 'The cooperation between the union and the left parties was the best ever. You have to imagine that 10,000 trade union members went door to door for six months - we copied that from your party - and convinced people to vote for one of the three left-wing parties, Enhedslisten, SF or Social Democrats. In the past, the unions only wanted to do something for the social democrats, but that is now over. After ten years of destroying workers' rights, it is clear in the union that supporting a left-wing bloc is now a must.' According to Juhl, SF's campaign gives his Enhedslisten a lot of space on the left: 'The SF must make compromises before the elections.' and therefore moves towards the center. The polls show that the people who lose weight from the SF end up with us. But we have agreed that in the last weeks of the campaign we will talk about the red government, and not about the differences between the left-wing parties. Union members have a lot of respect for that; they have the feeling that it will now all really work out.' As Denmark goes into election night, the polls are favorable for the left. Enhedslisten is making a big profit, but SF seems to be losing some seats. However, the 'Red bloc' has a majority. When the exit polls are announced at eight o'clock in the evening, the room where Enhedslisten is holding its election night fills with frenzied cheering. The results are presented on television as votes for the red or blue block. And the left seems to be winning. The results are trickling in and the celebration among the Enhedslisten cannot be stopped. The party scores extremely well in important districts, and in some districts of the capital Copenhagen the party is even the largest. After a few hours of great results, it becomes clear that Enhedslisten wins no fewer than 8 seats and goes from 4 to 12 seats. Then Enhedslisten spokesperson Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen appears on a podium among the people and addresses them: 'We have all succeeded in letting red win. And with this fantastic result for Enhedslisten, our party can play a major role in pulling the government to be formed to the left.' Enhedslisten does not want to participate in government, but does want to tolerate it. SF, the party that is eager to join the government, has an evening with mixed feelings. Their plan worked. By uniting the left and working hard on a clear alternative, a red government will be established and the SF itself will join the government for the first time in its history. At the same time, the party loses eight of its twenty-four seats. Dea Donkin is international secretary of the SF and assistant to party leader S√∏vndal during the campaign. She is having a hard time: 'We have been punished very harshly for our willingness to make compromises. What's even worse, the social liberals (who are also considered part of the 'left bloc' - ed.) have also won big and are now bigger than us. They are socio-economically very neoliberal and they will use their strong position to make the red government less red.' Cheers rise in the room. The reason is special: the leader of the Social Democrats Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who will become Prime Minister in the red government, appears on the television screens. The passionate cheering, even tears here and there, of the SF members for the party leader of another party shows how important SF's sacrifice has been for them. The SF's poor result also shows that the party has not entirely succeeded in getting immigration issues off the table. The gains within the left-wing bloc mainly go to Enhedslisten and the social liberals: the two sharpest critics of the anti-immigration policy. Such a shift can also be seen in the right-wing block. The Danish People's Party loses seats for the first time to the Liberals, who are (slightly) less anti-immigration, but socio-economically a lot more right-wing. The campaign was about the economy and jobs, and that's why the left won. But many voters also had to deal with years of harsh immigration policy.

183262.0," Today the House of Representatives debated the European Summit that will be held tomorrow with the heads of government in Brussels. Tensions are rising in Europe. Government leaders have been procrastinating for 2 years and have not gotten any further than putting out fires with bags of money. Taxpayer money, that is. What once started with a small fire in Greece has now grown into a large peat fire. 2 years ago this fire should have been put out immediately by declaring Greece bankrupt and expelling the euro. Then you would have immediately isolated the fire and minimized the risk of contamination. Under the direction of the IMF, the country should have put its affairs in order. After debt restructuring, Greece had seen light at the end of the tunnel with a devalued Drachma and was able to grow again. Now they are in pitch darkness! The PVV has therefore been against the emergency fund and this chosen apparent solution from day 1. Any form of financial support is known as pearls before swine. You don't solve debts with more debts. That is treating the symptoms (sticking plasters). In addition, an emergency fund sends a bad signal to countries to really change something. Greece is now receiving the next tranche (8 billion). (73 billion) I can still hear our Minister of Finance saying: ‚ÄúIt is no fun for Greece; They must meet strict conditions, otherwise they will get nothing and go bankrupt.‚Äù Muscle language from our Minister. Well, Greece does not meet the conditions for the hundred thousandth time and yet money is transferred again. Not only Greece is bankrupt, but the Troika. The sword of Damocles is now as blunt as anything. Greece would send home 20% of its civil servants (out of 1 million); that did not work! Greece would privatize for 50 billion; didn't work either! (400 million with the sale of 10% in Hellenic Telecom to Deutsche Telecom). What is the status of tax collection? Did not succeed!; It also seems difficult to me when the ink runs out and inspectors are on strike and... meanwhile we read that the Greeks have siphoned off 200 billion worth of money to Swiss banks. How crazy can you be to give the Greeks 1 cent at all, while they secretly stash away 200 billion themselves. Let them use that money to pay their debts instead of Henk and Ingrid's tax money. As a reward, a second bail-out of 109 billion will be decided. Greece can easily enter the Guinness Book of Records. Which country in the world has ever been rewarded so generously for such bad behavior? Emergency fund The emergency fund was installed last year as a safety net for countries in trouble. The Netherlands initially guaranteed 25 billion, but this has now risen to almost 100 billion. The safety net with high interest rates, short terms and a strict Troika has degenerated into a generous hammock. The French and Italian hawks are already jostling to get a piece of the pie. Borrow at 3% and pay back in 30 years, who wouldn't want that! Take Italy with the 2nd largest national debt in the world of 1,900 billion. And a Berlusconi who is suspected of corruption and goes through life bunga bunga dancing. Would the MP put his savings there? But will the MP soon guarantee billions for this country? The strict European Commissioner will not make much of an impression in Italy with sanctions and fines, I can predict that to the MP. And it is still not enough. Even before the 750 billion emergency fund has been formalized, there is talk of a substantial increase. It seems that they want to take over the entire debt of Southern Europe. All risks are dumped on the Northern European taxpayer and the incentive for Berlusconi to put things in order is washed down with a good bottle of Dom Perignon. Banks no longer trust each other and flee to safe havens. Instead of lending each other money, they deposit billions with the ECB (270 billion). It is fine that banks are going to meet higher capital requirements so that they can withstand a blow, but for this they have to turn to their own shareholders and, if necessary, their own government. There is also speculation about a larger contribution from the banks to the Greek debt mountain . After all, it is the Banks that have gambled on the wrong horse. It is not Henk and Ingrid who have saddled Greece with an unsustainable debt. But it can never be the intention that Henk and Ingrid's money is used to support Greek or French banks. The emergency fund may not be misused for this purpose. Because where was Sarkozy when we had to save our ABN Amro and ING for billions? Every euro country is responsible for its own housekeeping book and every country has to keep up its own pants. That was the agreement. When Greece could no longer meet its debt two years ago, it should have turned to the IMF (trustee). Under receivership, a bankruptcy, debt restructuring and an exit from the euro had been prepared and implemented. The problem Greece would have been isolated and contamination would have been prevented. The bill would have been paid by the Greeks and by the investors who gambled and lost. Now Henk and Ingrid are presented with the bill. The PVV opts for amputation instead of a treat. Greece is rewarded for its mismanagement and the Netherlands is punished for its soundness.

183286.0," It's old-fashioned chaos in Europe again. Van Rompuy, the duo Merkozy and Mr. Draghi is once again releasing test balloons without knowing where they will land. It is indicative of the way decision-making takes place, on a ship with 27 captains and 500 million sailors. If only I had listened to the PVV 2 years ago. Then we would have isolated the Greek problem and prevented contamination. By not doing this, the crisis will worsen and confidence in the euro will evaporate. We are being drawn further and further into the European swamp and we guarantee billions of euros for weak southern Euro countries. The Netherlands is even putting its triple A status at risk. The counter now stands at 150 billion! It is all or nothing. The PVV has therefore initiated an investigation into the return of the Gulden or the introduction of the Neuro. The population has the right to an honest story. Not what is best for Europe, but what is best for the Netherlands. That is what counts. The PVV therefore comes up with a Plan B! The government leaders want to save the euro at all costs, knowing that this would cost a lot of money, but it is too dear to their pride! A mountain of debt does not simply disappear and certainly not by borrowing more money. The Southern countries have celebrated for years thanks to the euro. They were able to borrow cheaply and thus played Sinterklaas instead of putting their affairs in order. No one stopped them. Wages shot up (*) as did imports (**). The State was one big ATM, while at the same time productivity and competitiveness (***) visibly decreased, resulting in high unemployment (****).(*): 2000-2009 wage increase in Greece 40%, in Spain 31%, in Portugal 27%, compared to Germany 7%(**) China has a trade surplus on Italy of 40 billion, while 10 years ago this was 0!'(***) According to the World Economic Forum competition index, Italy is in 48th place, just behind Indonesia and Brunei(****) Youth unemployment in Italy is 30%, in Spain 50%.¬†The problem countries have derailed the matter and now want to pass the buck to us. We didn't get married like that! That was never the agreement (no bail-out). A few examples: Take Italy, with a debt of almost 2 trillion euros. This country has a black economy of more than 22%, in other words 350 billion is earned undeclared and therefore no VAT, no premiums and no taxes are paid on it. So 150 billion is up for grabs. All they have to do is bend over! Italy is also pension country number one. More than 200 billion (14%) is spent on pensions, making it the leader (OECD) (NL 30 billion = 5%). That is not surprising when you consider that some retire at the age of 39 (such as Umberto Bossi's wife). Italy also loses 60 billion annually due to corruption in the public sector (Italian Court of Audit) and it is not without reason that it ranks 67th on the corruption index, just above Rwanda (Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International). Greece is even worse. Tax evasion is the number 1 national sport there, as much as 25% of the economy is black! In this country 60 billion is up for grabs, but they don't do it! The Greeks have long since transferred their savings to Swiss banks and have stashed away between 200 and 600 billion! Greece is even more corrupt than Colombia. The Southern countries also still have many state assets that they can sell and/or privatize. For example, according to ECB director (Lorenzo Bini Smaghi), Greece has assets worth 300 billion (source: the New York Times). Italy also owns almost 1,800 billion worth of buildings, state-owned companies and art treasures (source: Bloomberg). If these countries tackle their black economy, fight fraud and corruption and sell their state assets and stop offering pensions and free healthcare, all problems will be solved. . Why don't they do that?! Now Henk and Ingrid can pay for their debts, while they remain on their money. That's so easy! For years, the Southern Europeans paid far too low interest rates on government paper, with which they purchased their prosperity and paid their douceurs. Now investors have woken up and see that countries have allowed their public finances to derail, resulting in high interest rates. The agreements in the Maastricht Treaty have been violated and all the while government leaders stood by and watched as countries pulled out of the curve. flew. Merkel & Sarkozy now want to fix this as a signal to the markets in the hope that calm will return. They have seen that all actions so far have not made any difference. The loan to Greece, the emergency fund, the ECB's interventions, the promises of austerity from new governments, nothing has helped. The crisis continues and investors are abandoning the euro. Merkozy is clutching at their last straw. Then a new Treaty containing automatic sanctions for budget sinners. That's all very nice, but it remains a rearguard action. This is the same as thinking about fire prevention during a violent fire. We see that Greece, as the biggest sinner, does not receive sanctions but rather presents from all sides. Billions in subsidies, loans, waivers. Of course, countries that make a mess of things must be dealt with harshly. The PVV previously advocated a clear 3-stage rocket. First a warning, then a hefty fine and if this still doesn't work, out of the euro. The MP also presented the sanction ‚Äúfrom the euro‚Äù (Financial Times). What's left of that?! Was this tough talk or will he still enforce this sanction in Brussels? There would also be an independent European Commissioner. Where has that gone in the proposals? And then the biggest sting; the permanent emergency fund (European Stability Mechanism). The Merkozy duo wants to have this operational from the end of next year. The PVV sees no point in this permanent safety net, which is more like a hammock with perverse incentives. For countries that are off track, a pot of 500 billion is ready. Investors no longer run the risk of default. The fund guarantees everything and everyone! A few questions: Is it true... ‚Ä¢ that a (qualified) majority can determine whether we must make additional contributions (Board of Directors) ‚Ä¢ that an 85% majority can determine how and to what end the money is spent and whether the registered capital (700 billion) should be increased (blank check) ‚Ä¢ this means that Germany (27%), France (20.4%) and Italy (17.9%) can veto any decisions, while the rest and therefore the Netherlands will also lose its veto? That can't be true, can it?!‚Ä¢that Van Rompuy has proposed turning ESM into a bank?‚Ä¢that EFSF will not be merged into ESM, but that both will continue to exist side by side?Our research into the Gulden or the Neuro is only becoming more urgent . The risks are piling up. The euro is not sacred. The euro is a means of payment and should not become an end in itself, which must be kept alive at all costs. The PVV therefore wants a referendum on every Treaty change. Let Henk and Ingrid decide whether they think it is responsible for their grandchildren to still be making payments. Grandpa and grandma must then be able to justify themselves.¬†Motion by Tony van Dijck The House has heard the deliberation, considering that the Lisbon Treaty may be amended; considering that a permanent emergency fund (ESM) may be set up in 2012; requests the government to include the ESM Treaty and/or any other Treaty amendment in a to submit a referendum to the Dutch population, and it will become the order of the day.

183700.0,"Geert Wilders is 'surprised' that a resident of The Hague who is now in custody for recruiting jihad fighters was able to get very close to him on the street last year. Surrounded by personal security guards, the PVV leader visited the Schilderswijk in The Hague in May 2013. A photo from last year shows Oussama C. standing approximately two meters away from Wilders and taking a photo. Reliable sources confirm to the ANP that it concerns the 18-year-old man from The Hague who was arrested last month for recruiting fighters for the civil war in Syria. Justice also suspects him of incitement to a terrorist crime, including via social media. He expressed his extremist ideas on the internet and the radio. The police believe that he was also preparing to join the fight 'under the flag of a terrorist organization'. Not in danger for a moment According to the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV), Wilders was not in danger for a moment during his visit, a spokesperson said. He could not say anything further about the security measures taken at the time. For security reasons, no information is provided about this. It is clear that Wilders was flanked on all sides by security guards from the Royal and Diplomatic Security Service (DKDB). It is also not known whether C. ever made threats to Wilders. ""To put it bluntly, I am surprised that this man could come so close to me, almost between the DKDB members."" , was all Wilders could say about it. The reason for his visit to the 'Sharia district' was an article in the newspaper Trouw. The newspaper concluded based on its own research that part of the Schilderswijk is developing into an enclave of orthodox Muslims.

183527.0," the hague‚Ä¢ Geert Wilders spreads his wings. There will be European elections next year and you better be early, especially if you expect a velvet revolution from the anti-Eurocrats. Wilders wants to collaborate with like-minded parties such as Front National. ""I don't think there is a politician in the House of Representatives who is better known abroad than me."" Frank Hendrickx and Marcel WiegmanWhere are you on Tuesday? ""In De Nieuwe Kerk.""Are you also going to take the oath to the king? ""Certainly.""Congratulations? ""I'm looking forward to it. What we will soon experience in the church as MPs is not for everyone. I bought a very nice tuxedo for the evening. And for the day I rented a morning suit with a nice gray cardigan. I really like it a lot. Awesome. A national holiday. ""A symbol of national sovereignty. At least of our national identity. You want King Willem-Alexander to limit himself to cutting ribbons. These are not the moments when you should do politics. Of course, I didn't always agree with Her Majesty, but I always respected the dedication she put into her work. I have never come close to the letter R for republican."" You recently spoke with Marine le Pen, leader of the National Front. ""In a restaurant in Paris. A two-hour lunch. I thought she was an impressive woman. A very powerful politician. We think ninety percent the same about Europe and perhaps more. We also have many common points when it comes to immigration.""Did the initiative come from you? Yes, it is the first visit of many that I have. will bring to political leaders in Europe in the coming months. We can make a huge impact next year. Parties that oppose what we call the elite line are growing rapidly in popularity. Parties that attach importance to national interests, to national identity. If we join forces, we can achieve a huge amount. ""Which parties are involved? ""I'm not going to say that now. Some parties do not want it to become public. You can often only do that after such a meeting has ended. decide conversation ""The Vlaams Belang? I will definitely visit that, but they don't know that yet."" Alternative for Germany? Once again: I'm not going to mention names."" In the past you openly distanced yourself from the Front National.,,A lot has changed there. Marine le Pen won the internal elections a few years ago against a candidate who wanted to continue her father's line. She has made a break with the past. ""She wanted to get rid of the grimy image? ""For me it is important that everything that has to do with anti-Semitism has been renounced."" Last year she launched a plan to ban yarmulkes ""We will never do that."" Have you talked about that yet? ""No. But I know her position and she knows ours. She has made a proposal to ban all religious symbols in public spaces. We want only abandon Islamic symbols, because we see Islam as an ideology and not as a religion."" She also said she considers herself much less radical than you. ""Look at that. How wrong you were all these years!"" She said: ""For him, Islam is incompatible with democracy, but I believe that the vast majority of Muslims are in favor of democracy."" ""I never said that the majority of the Muslims are terrorists. You can really look at whether there are differences, but my message is: it was a great meeting and we have a lot in common. We have to work together on the points where we agree."" Are you kindred spirits? ‚ÄúThat's not what it's about at all. I am not advocating a merger. ""Where will your new international movement end? ""I don't know yet. I have only had one conversation. I think we have allowed ourselves to be held hostage for far too long by politically correct journalists, by politicians and intellectuals. When I go to Germany and you read the newspapers there, you get the impression that some scary fascist has arrived. When Marine le Pen comes to the Netherlands, the journalists here also write about her you become afraid to meet each other. I said: we are just going to judge people for what they are, without fear of the electoral consequences. I have more with those parties abroad than with the entire House of Representatives."" It seems to be your own European unification is. If we do not join forces, the parties that do join forces will win. In the Liberal International, the Christian Democratic International or ‚Äì even worse ‚Äì the Socialist International. If we find each other, it would be a huge signal to that entire elite who think we would never succeed. The momentum is there. I am convinced that the settlement will take place next year in many European countries.""And you are already dreaming of your own International. ""I only tell my dreams to my wife.""How many seats will you get? ""I will not give an estimate doing. That's the dumbest thing you can do as a politician. I just do not know. I do know that a political revolution is going to happen. From England to Germany, from France to the Netherlands and Italy. In all those countries people are standing up and saying: no! Not this way."" There will also be a lot of people who wonder what the PVV has achieved in the European Parliament. ""I think our people have worked very hard and have done their utmost, but we now have to go a step further Participate in faction formation. We must work together in the European Parliament. Absolutely."" In The Hague, your visits abroad are seen as a flight to the front, now that you are away from the center of power. Such a bullshit argument, because I did this before, in February I was in Australia. I don't think there is a politician in the House of Representatives who is better known abroad than I am. They are stupid people who write crazy stories. Someone thinks something and then writes it down. Someone else is also not very smart and then writes it down. At a certain point it becomes a theory and no one questions whether it is correct. I don't even understand the theory. I would now spend more time abroad because as a PVV we no longer tolerate the cabinet."" You seem to be isolated in parliament these days. ""I am not interested in the House of Representatives. I am concerned about the voter,"" You want a see as much of your program implemented as possible. Of course, but I would have been in ten insane asylums if I had cared anything about what other parties think of me. I'm here for the voter. So it makes perfect sense for me to go outside. I happen to be in the Chamber, but it could just as well have been on the Volendam market. We are not going to negotiate a policy that will destroy the Netherlands, just to gain a crumb of influence. We are actually the only opposition party at the moment. Tolerate all others, from the CDA to D66 and the SP. They all enjoy being on the front page of the newspaper. ""What is your strategy to get back to the center of power? ""Become as big as possible. Become as big as possible."" During your resistance tour through In the Netherlands, you received a hero's welcome in cities such as Spijkenisse and Volendam. ""It was heart-warming."" Yet you only participate in the municipal elections in Almere and The Hague. ""The Germans say: in der Beschr√§nkung say sich der Meister. There are I'm sure there are people who would have liked to vote for us, but it is still wise not to participate and to first consolidate the organization."" Because of the risk of failure. Yes. We do not yet have the organization for it. ""Are you going to give voting advice? ""I cannot rule that out. Sometimes a local party can be a very good alternative. But the differences are big. There are local parties that we have nothing to do with. and there are local parties that have nothing to do with us. In Rotterdam I would say: vote Leefbaar Rotterdam. ""No national party that is close to the PVV, perhaps the VVD?"" What do you think? ""You have an unexpected one."" ally: the PvdA is in favor of criminalizing illegality. I can say to the friends of the PvdA that the PVV in the Senate will be happy and confident to help this bill get a majority. We have never done that before in a government proposal, but we do now. I saw Job Cohen at Nieuwsuur. He said that there is not yet an active search for illegal immigrants, but that he is concerned that this will change. He is right. After the elections, we will do everything we can to track down, arrest and deport illegal immigrants. I won't say: hunt them down, smoke them out - but we will set up a special unit for it: the Cohen police."" With that law in hand. ""Absolutely."" You seem to be enjoying it. ""To to speak to Bram Moszkowicz: I hear what you are saying."" You laugh. ""The PvdA must realize what we want with this law: track down, detain and deport illegal immigrants with maximum effort. If the polls prove true at the next elections and the PVV becomes the largest, we will ensure that. That is a friendly gesture from me to Mr Cohen and the PvdA. We are not a party with three seats, Mr Samsom. ""Maybe the PvdA is going to make illegality a criminal offence If it does not go ahead, I wonder what the VVD still has to do with this coalition. The VVD accepted a children's pardon and received this point in exchange. If the PvdA no longer supports this proposal, the government will fall. Also good."" How great do you estimate that chance? ""I don't think this cabinet will be in office for much longer. The atmosphere is completely poisoned. You also saw that during the debate about State Secretary Fred Teeven. The PvdA simply said that he would like to see the advantage of he rightly demanded full confidence. In the two years that we tolerated, we never thought of dealing with the coalition partners in this way dumber than stupid if they stay in the coalition.""

164073.0," Today I almost fell off my chair when I read the interview that my PvdA colleague in the European Parliament, Thijs Berman, gave to Nu.nl. In his view, the SP's long-term plans are a drama, in the Netherlands and (especially) in Europe. He agrees with the framing that all Europhiles apply to the SP: the SP is said to be against Europe. Even Maarten van Rossum agreed with this during yesterday's party council. Apparently Europhiles are currently so frustrated by the total lack of support from ordinary people that they only hope to get their point through lies and distortions. Then I can quickly help them out of this dream: contrary to what they think, many people in the Netherlands have thought carefully about Europe. They would like to work together, but are fed up with the insidious way in which more and more powers are transferred to Brussels without them being able to really influence it themselves. In the EP I vote in favor of many good European laws and the SP contributes to a fair, social and human Europe. But we are not going to impose a 'United States of Europe' on our population who simply do not feel like it at all. I think that's called democracy. In the European Parliament I have seriously tried to reach an agreement with the PvdA against the proposed economic governance. Unfortunately, the PvdA kept ducking away from this. During the votes it became clear why: the PvdA, unlike most other social democrats in the EP, voted in favor of the so-called 6pack. This is the package of bills aimed solely at budget discipline. Attention to poverty, employment and fair income relations is lacking. It is incredible that the PvdA did not mind any of this. Since then I have found it very difficult to work with the Dutch social democrats in this area. This is often a lot easier with their sister parties from other Member States. They understand that the current package will lead to poverty and wage cuts for ordinary people, while the casino capitalists will not be affected. In the interview, Thijs Berman indicates that he wants to maintain the euro at all costs. Oh yes, and also that the SP is antisocial, because we let the Greeks suffocate. Apparently he has lost all contact with reality: things are going from bad to worse in Greece. State properties have to be sold for next to nothing, and such harsh cuts are being pushed through that one small business after another is closing, young people are left without opportunities and the most basic facilities are lacking. More and more people are becoming homeless, and more and more sick people are no longer receiving proper care. Yes, Thijs, the Greeks are very grateful for your 'help'. Then the SP: we are fed up with the fact that all the billions supposedly given to Greece so far as 'aid' have actually only helped the banks. Greece must use all that money to pay off its loans to the banks, so that they do not suffer losses. Furthermore, the cuts are only aimed at reducing wages to the level of a developing country. At the expense of the employees. This is a disastrous policy that is demonstrably leading to the collapse of the Greek economy, simply because people run out of money. And no more consumer demand means a setback and even higher debts. Our plans were and are much more realistic: cancel most of the debt, tackle corruption and discuss an investment plan to pull the Greek economy out of the swamp. And as far as the euro is concerned: if large countries such as Italy and Spain also appear to continually need extra support, then the time may indeed come when the euro becomes unaffordable for us. But no one, including the SP, can predict whether that will happen. In any case, the SP's position is a lot more realistic than the utopian haze in which my PvdA colleague apparently lives: or could it be pure frustration about the failure of his own party in Europe?

164559.0," 'Europe has brought us a lot of good, but is currently threatened by politicians who want to quickly push through a European government, a European president and a European super state.' Emile Roemer said this today in the debate on the euro crisis. ‚ÄúAnyone who cherishes European cooperation is no longer on the leash of the financial markets, where no form of democracy is possible,‚Äù Roemer said. Read Emile Roemer's input below. Europe has brought us many good things. We have now had peace for 60 years, something that might not have been possible without the European Union. We trade extensively with our neighboring countries and can visit each other without a barrier or passport. We fight environmental pollution, human trafficking and terrorism together. The mutual differences in language and culture are not barriers, but an enrichment. But Europe is threatened: by politicians who want to quickly push through a European government, a European president and a European super state. A national newspaper headlined this morning: ‚Äúabout us, without us‚Äù. Double true on this headline. First of all, because the Netherlands is not at the table in all important discussions. But also because people are not involved in European politics, which means that support for European cooperation disappears like snow in the sun. The real anti-Europe parties are those parties that want to push the United States of Europe through with a Big Bang. That Europe now seems to be on the horizon, at least if we can believe all the ideas that will be discussed tomorrow and the day after. The euro countries are in danger of losing control of their budgets and their banks to Brussels and the European Central Bank. There should be a European Ministry of Finance that should decide on our budget. And so-called 'Eurobonds', which mean we have to pay for the problems that other countries are experiencing, are also on the horizon. That is the new Europe of EU President Herman van Rompuy. Much more Brussels is not the way out of the crisis in Europe. The Prime Minister 'seems' to realize this too. Ever since the presentation of the coalition agreement, he has vowed that no powers will go to Brussels under his leadership. We now know better. Partly thanks to this Prime Minister, the European Commission is allowed to interfere with our entire economic policy, including the retirement age and the housing market, and in some cases even impose fines worth billions. In the meantime, the Prime Minister has also signed an ESM treaty, with which we have given away control over 40 billion. He also signed a budget pact, which forces us to make even more cuts. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that much more control has already gone to Brussels under his leadership? EU President Van Rompuy talks about building blocks, but does not tell us what they will build: a banking union, a fiscal union and far-reaching centralization of economic policy. Only yesterday it became clear how serious and how far-reaching this plan is. President Van Rompuy writes in his plan that public support must be worked on for further integration of Europe. But this is at odds with the proposals he makes. Public support for undemocratic measures? The people are not crazy! Does the Prime Minister really think that citizens will accept this? It is clear to the SP that the current crisis is being abused to trick the Netherlands into a political union. How does the Prime Minister see that? People are tired of having to bail out banks all the time. Those banks are now 'too big to fail'. Is that being addressed? No! We must become responsible for each other's banks and their potential losses across the Eurozone, while supervision is taken away and placed in the hands of uncontrolled technocrats. The SP is also not looking for a European deposit guarantee scheme. Will the Prime Minister agree to this tomorrow? Who knows what bodies are still in the closet, from the banking sector in the various Member States? Better supervision is fine, of course, but first reduce the risks. For example, by separating utility and investment banks, by tightening capital requirements and by introducing a transaction tax. To achieve this, the Netherlands should also immediately join the proposed leading group by France and Germany. That means working together in Europe. I would like a response from the Prime Minister. Will he do that on Thursday? The economic policy that the EU wants to prescribe to us is downright antisocial. Van Rompuy even suggested this week to use the same retirement age everywhere. It doesn't get much crazier. Collaboration is fine. And desperately needed. To prevent countries from competing on wages and taxes. But Brussels will soon determine how much debt you can have as a country, and how large your government deficit can be. Then Brussels can force us to adjust the budget. As far as the SP is concerned, the Prime Minister will be calling for the introduction of a social agenda in Europe in the coming days. Agreements on a European social minimum. Agreements on a joint approach to poverty and the fight against exploitation. Does the Prime Minister share our view that the recommendations from Brussels are far too go far? And is he prepared to make that known on Thursday and argue for a social agenda? Then what? There is also a growth package on the agenda. 130 billion, which by the way has been presented many times as something new. We support the plan to use existing European resources for this more effectively, whether or not via the European Investment Bank (EIB). But that will not be effective if we do not simultaneously make more realistic agreements about the drive for austerity in Europe, which is putting severe pressure on economic growth everywhere. As already said. In the short term, we will have to tackle and regulate the financial markets to prevent countries from being destroyed by speculation. The emergency fund appears to have little or no effect. The European Central Bank (ECB) can buy government bonds, which does have that effect. She has already done that in the past. We must regulate the financial sector: By banning bonuses in the financial sector. By separating utility and investment banks, or from normal activities and investment activities within banks. By properly testing new financial products. By independent and non-commercial credit rating agencies. By introducing stricter capital requirements and a transaction tax (tobin tax). By more openness about the financial markets and the possibility to stop trading in government loans in extreme situations. And of course countries that have made a mess of it must put their affairs in order. And of course there must be more balance between the different economies within the eurozone. And of course we need to stimulate the economy in the northern countries. The Prime Minister must discuss this with other European leaders tomorrow. Not about the otherworldly views of European officials, but about concrete solutions to acute problems. Europe was once meant to give free people a free choice. And that is precisely what is constantly frustrated, sometimes even blocked. By politicians who felt that people could not handle such a choice. And so we had no referendum on the euro, no referendum on European treaties. And so the result of the only referendum we did get was thrown in the trash. And were the people wrong? Were people too stupid to decide their own future? No. If administrators had listened better to citizens, the problems would not have been so great. Then we wouldn't have been so deep in the crisis now. I am already looking forward to the time when we have a government that will dare to say in Brussels: work together yes, dictate the law for us no! And I want to ask this Prime Minister: is he prepared to give the citizens a voice? Is he prepared to present European plans that will intervene in people's lives? Can he promise here that no control will be given away without first asking the people? Anyone who cherishes European cooperation will handle it with care. And does not thunder through the European china cabinet like an elephant. Anyone who loves European cooperation will not hand over sovereignty just like that. Those who cherish European cooperation are no longer on the leash of the financial markets, where no form of democracy is possible. The role of the Prime Minister is dubious to say the least. Not only here do we have no idea what the Prime Minister actually stands for, but also in Brussels. This Prime Minister waits with substantive responses until Van Rompuy has finished his building blocks. But Chairman, you cannot help build AFTER delivery. Let alone that you want to slow down construction or even stop it in parts. Especially in these crucial times, the Netherlands hardly takes any initiative. We are just struggling to keep the money tap open. We must take back control of Europe, restore democracy, choose the democratic constitutional state over the financial jungle. And I am convinced that we will find more and more supporters for this, in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. Look around, in France and Germany, in Greece and Spain. It is time for us to make ourselves heard in Brussels again. So it's time we send in a watchdog. Mr President, I cannot wait for September 12.

160672.0," D66 faction leader Sophie in 't Veld today presents her report on parliamentary supervision of intelligence services in Europe. The report is based on the European Parliament's hearings on mass eavesdropping of citizens on the internet and by telephone. The report concludes that the supervision of secret services in the internet age is completely inadequate. In 't Veld makes recommendations for stronger supervision, including that there should always be prior review by the judge. ‚ÄúThe police are not allowed to simply invade a house, why should intelligence services be allowed to eavesdrop without permission?‚Äù, says In 't Veld. The committee of inquiry makes several recommendations to improve the supervision of national intelligence services and to bring them to an equal level. The so-called Tshwane Principles, supported by the United Nations, among others, on national security and the right to information must be developed at European level. In 't Veld: ‚ÄúNational supervision appears to fail time and time again. Cross-border cooperation between national secret services must have a solid democratic basis. I therefore want all Member States to base supervision on the same standards. So that we can be confident that supervision is well organized throughout Europe and that cooperation between services within Europe runs smoothly.‚Äù The committee also recommends recording the position and powers of the shadowy European secret service Intcen. This has no basis in the treaties of the European Union. ‚ÄúIt's bizarre that no one knows what they do, what powers they have or who is politically responsible. I want supervision to be arranged as in the Netherlands; secretly via a supervisory authority and a European commission. So that Parliament can also sound the alarm if boundaries are being crossed,"" says In 't Veld. In 't Veld will present her report around 4:30 PM, click here for the livestream.

170948.0," The CDA is shocked by the findings of the Inspectorate of Security and Justice about the identification of asylum seekers in the Netherlands. It is still not in order. While the recent attack in Berlin has shown how important not only careful identification is, but also a sound and functioning asylum system in a broader sense. ¬†Unfortunately, it has been the case for some time that identification in the Netherlands has gaps. The previous Inspection Report, in May 2016, also concluded that the identification process had shortcomings. That is why Mona Keijzer has submitted a number of motions to close those gaps.¬†For example, the CDA asks the government to quickly solve a number of problems. Starting with all existing defects mentioned by the Inspectorate with regard to available time, capacity and equipment. Furthermore, the government must ensure that all data carriers of incoming asylum seekers are read at all identification locations. There must also be sufficient qualified and experienced staff present at all identification locations on that date. They must be given sufficient time to complete all steps of identification carefully and completely. Finally, it must be ensured that the necessary technical equipment and equipment are available at all identification locations and can be deployed at all times.¬†Mona Keijzer: ‚ÄúAccording to the CDA, the threat level in the Netherlands, but in Europe as a whole, shows that absolutely no risks should be taken in this area.

183717.0," The end of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is getting closer and the call for an independent international investigation is getting louder. Not if PVV leader Geert Wilders likes it. ""We must support Israel unconditionally in that battle,"" he told NU.nl. International criticism of the war violence by Hamas, but especially Israel, is increasing every day and tensions between population groups are increasing in the Netherlands. Last Tuesday, Minister Frans Timmermans (Foreign Affairs) wrote in an opinion article in NRC Handelsblad that he found the violence ""unacceptable"". What did you think of the article?"" Incomprehensible. He says that it is not a fight between Jews and Muslims. Yes, it is not a fight between Christians and Hindus. This is something that is about that and is happening in that region. In At such a time when Israel is the only democracy in that region and the bastion of the free West, we should stand united behind Israel. ""Do you miss that attitude?"" Yes, I miss that in the Netherlands. That does not surprise me to the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Frans Timmermans ed.), because I know that as a PvdA man he has a different view on this, but I find it incomprehensible that we do not now show more solidarity with Israel. I also find it incomprehensible that the Minister has not identified the cause of the hatred of Jews that really exists in Hamas."" Yet Minister Timmermans is also critical of the role of Hamas in the conflict. He condemns the stockpiling of weapons in schools and hospitals and the shelling of Israel. Timmermans also believes that Israel has the right to defend itself against this. ""This is not a time to be balanced. This is a time to choose. This is a moment that does not require balance, because balance is not necessary. You must now standing up for a country that, as far as I know, does not aim to destroy any Arab country or people. The other way around is the case."" ""At such a moment you have to stand behind the state of Israel and not say 'listen, this is not a conflict between Muslims and Jews' and 'Israeli intervention is disproportionate'. Imagine if this were to happen in the Netherlands, then we would also hit back hard."" But Timmermans also says in last week's written consultation and the opinion article that the government endorses that Israel has the right to defend itself?"" Yes, but he is also critical of Israel. ""Are you not allowed to ask questions about the proportionality of Israeli war violence?"" Of course you are allowed to ask questions. An investigation is also allowed. I would have preferred not to have that, but that's okay. But I would have preferred if he had demanded an investigation into Hamas. Everyone reads and sees how Hamas shoots rockets from schools and hospitals. ""Wouldn't an international independent investigation be good to at least determine whether Israel acted proportionately?"" No, that sends the wrong signal. What we forget is that the fight against Israel, a fight against everything that is not Islam, is a fight against freedom and democracy. If Israel falls, we will be next. Timmermans should support Israel. ""Unconditionally?"" Well, I don't say always and unconditionally, that might be going a bit far. As far as I am concerned, we do support Israel unconditionally in a struggle, but of course not in everything that Israel does. That would be too crazy for words.""""This is not a territorial conflict, but an ideological conflict. Many people think that if you can give land for peace. It is an illusion to think that if you give a piece of land you will get peace in return."" ""It is a fallacy to think in a two-state solution."" You do not believe in a two-state solution as proposed by the UN has been instructed?"" Well in the sense that the Palestinians already have a state, namely Jordan. Jordan is the Palestinian state. So that two-state solution is already there. ""What do you think is the best approach to Hamas?"" Talking or negotiating with Isis or Hamas is pointless. They are barbarians. Only the total destruction of these types of terrorist organizations will make a difference."" GroenLinks Leader Bram van Ojik argued on Wednesday for a drastic change in the attitude of the Dutch government in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Van Ojik wants to institute economic development of Gaza of arms embargo and political support for the Palestinian state."" However, I think the opposite of what GroenLinks thinks. I think it is insane that the Netherlands has given development aid to Gaza. That is rewarding wrong behavior. It is money spent by Hamas."" But Timmermans assures the House in the written consultation that no money has been transferred to Hamas. He talks about ""robust verification procedures"" to ensure that the money does not end up in the hands of terrorist organizations. ""Ultimately, Hamas is in charge of Gaza. So ultimately Hamas benefits from that money. ""Is Timmermans lying when he informs the House in this way?"" This is a canard of the highest order. It may not end up in Gaza's bank account, but Hamas is in charge there. No one can rule out that Hamas uses that money to build the tunnels. Even if that is not the case, the money goes to an area controlled by Hamas."" The Gaza war has caused a lot of trouble worldwide and also in the Netherlands. We have seen anti-Semitic expressions during a number of Gaza demonstrations. The government subsequently released a statement together with a Jewish organization that took a firm stand against anti-Semitism and discrimination in the Netherlands. You previously called this statement a ""nonsense statement."" that Prime Minister Rutte and this cabinet do not want to see. It is objective to see that all those anti-Semitic statements are made by people who adhere to Islam."" ""A statement where the cause is not mentioned is without obligation, goes nowhere and is a fluff statement."" Most demonstrators are critical of the policies of the Israeli government. Are they also anti-Semitic?"" No. Of course you can be critical of any country. Let us be especially happy that we can demonstrate in the Netherlands, but giving the Hitler salute and waving ISIS flags is really not possible."" ""We should deal differently with organizations like ISIS that aim to overthrow us. We must tackle this seriously."" In the same statement, the cabinet writes that it will take tough action against anti-Semitic and discriminatory expressions during the demonstrations. Those who do so will have to deal with the Public Prosecution Service and the judiciary. What else can the cabinet do? do?"" I think that ISIS-like demonstrations should not be allowed in the Netherlands."" But the cabinet says it is taking action against this. ""They still allow it."" We have seen how the police in Amsterdam acted adequately, right? ""Yes, fortunately things have been different in Amsterdam than, for example, The Hague. That's how it can be done."" This morning the Telegraaf published a full-page advertisement against hatred of Jews that was signed by well-known Dutch people. You were approached by Mrs. Voet of the CIDI to sign the advertisement, but did not see your name. Were you shocked? ""I think that incomprehensible. I received a letter from Mrs Voet herself on Tuesday. I responded within half an hour that of course I can draw. Obvious. I didn't hear from her after that. ""So you were surprised when you opened the newspaper this morning?"" Yes, I was looking for my name and I couldn't find it. I thought 'what do we get now...' ""According to Mrs Voet, you were taken off the list because you called the joint statement of the cabinet and the Jewish organization a ""nonsense statement"". ""She could have called me to clarify the situation."" to lay. By linking it to my criticism of the statement, Esther Voet disqualifies herself as a fighter against anti-Semitism and an advocate of the Jewish community in the Netherlands. It's like she can't handle criticism. I think that's a shame, because I would have liked to sign it."" The CIDI and the Central Jewish Consultation (CJO) distanced themselves from you and the PVV after your less-Moroccan statements and flirted with European political parties that have made anti-Semitic statements in the past Does that haunt you?"" That may all be true, but there is an argument why that doesn't apply and that is: they asked me to sign. I didn't call to ask 'can I participate?'. If I respond positively within half an hour, it is not done to delete my name without explanation. Then they shouldn't have asked me. ""What do you think about the representatives of the Jewish community distancing themselves from you?"" I have a lot of friends from the Jewish community. I know I have the support of many of them. The CIDI does not speak for all Jews in the Netherlands. It is not my mission to do the CIDI either."" ""My mission is not about the CIDI either, but to keep the Netherlands a free Western country where the Jewish-Christian humanistic culture is threatened by Islamization."" ""I like Mrs. Voet apparently does not make a link between Islam and anti-Semitism, but look at what Hamas is doing in Gaza, look at what ISIS is doing to Christians in Iraq. They all get a turn."" ""I don't understand how someone who says they represent the interests of the Jewish community doesn't see this. If Islam gets the blessing here, the Jews will be the first to turn. ""So you are not of the opinion that you have lost the goodwill of the Jewish community in the Netherlands?"" I only notice that to a very limited extent. Both in the Netherlands and abroad, on the contrary, the support in the Netherlands and internationally is still heart-warming.""

162442.0," VVD -CDA -PVV and the art of not making cuts (yourself) Both the VVD and the CDA promised in their election manifestos that significant cuts would be made to make public finances 'sustainable' again. In addition, social security had to be significantly reformed to make the labor market resilient to an aging population. The coalition and tolerance agreement is revealing: there is hardly any new policy, even the announced migration and integration policy hardly gives cause for excitement, even though the commotion in the CDA about whether or not to accept the agreement suggests otherwise. The proposed cuts are made on paper or are passed on to other governments (such as municipalities and developing countries). Text: Harrie Verbon, professor of Public Finance, Tilburg University Policy It has been noticed by many observers, but the policy that will be pursued in accordance with the coalition and tolerance agreement is mainly characterized by the lack of reforms. Healthcare, the housing market, supplementary pensions, sectors where there are quite a few problems resulting from an aging population, are mainly left to run their course. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial security also remains largely untouched. Only the schemes for young disabled people will be cut back, but there will be no revision of the unemployment benefit. Even in the areas that should be the pillars of this coalition and especially tolerance agreement, namely immigration and integration policy, hardly any new policy is being pursued. The tone is also moderate and the ambitions do not make a xenophobic impression. Immigration policy is aimed at limiting the arrival of immigrants with few prospects. Immigrants must integrate and take an exam for this. If they do not pass that exam, a temporary residence permit can be revoked. Some critics have characterized this as inhumane. These critics will undoubtedly find it normal that at most educational institutions a diploma is only awarded after the student has successfully completed a sufficient number of exams. A permanent residence permit is only given if the immigrant has a certain starting qualification. This last tightening can only be introduced if EU directives are amended. It is not obvious that the Netherlands will be able to organize a majority for this in the EU. It is in line with the aim of integration that family migration is made more difficult. Furthermore, children with significant language delays are forced ('by force and pressure') to attend preschool education. The migration and integration policy therefore does not make an overwhelmingly ambitious impression. Many activities are being intensified, such as checks on immigrant crime, checks on migrant workers, and the like. But there is no policy to break the ghettoization of immigrant residential areas in the big cities. The disproportionately high crime rate among Moroccan boys is being tackled through re-education and addressing parents about it. The so-called safety houses must play a role here. However, these already exist and were opened with great enthusiasm by the former Minister of Justice and one of the opponents of this coalition, Ernst Hirsch Ballin. Cutting back The CPB calculated in the spring that in order to make public finances sustainable again, a net of 29 billion euros per year would have to be cut. In the coalition agreement, the parties think 18 billion is enough. Because the outgoing Balkenende-IV cabinet had already booked cuts worth almost four billion, on balance only about 14 billion euros still had to be found. A cutback really yields something if a certain group can be put at a disadvantage. The Lubbers-I cuts, for example, included reductions in benefits. Apart from the question of whether cuts in benefits are desirable, the direct budgetary effect is easy to determine. If the number of people receiving benefits is roughly known, one can multiply this number by the gross decrease in benefits and the resulting amount represents the size of the cut. The intended coalition did not opt ‚Äã‚Äãfor this 'easy' cut, despite the fact that both the VVD and the CDA had announced cuts in benefits in their programs. Instead, the cuts are mainly in the nature of paper cuts, such as efficiency improvements and government equipment discounts. These amount to more than 2 billion euros. It is known that such cuts are not usually successful, because they require the dismissal of civil servants, while the tasks that the civil servants perform continue as normal. In addition to those 2 billion, there is a large potpourri of small cuts in the government with prosaic indications such as 'spatial integration above and beyond the statutory requirements' or 'increasing rail sector revenues and greater efficiency'. In five years' time, no one will know that these measures have been taken and whether they have yielded the intended amount. Amounts may have been included in advance for these items in budgets, but at most for a limited period and not for a period of more than four years. Nevertheless, a multitude of these types of mini-measures must guarantee the sustainability of public finances in the longer term. The government cuts, which are classified in the coalition agreement under the heading 'smaller government', and which total approximately 6 billion euros, cannot therefore be qualified as reliable. What is reliable are the cuts that can be imposed on, or passed on to, citizens and other authorities. This concerns in particular the limitation of the healthcare allowance (2.2 billion euros), the discount on the provincial and municipal funds (1.6 billion euros), the payments to the EU (1 billion euros) and the discount on the development cooperation (0.9 billion). The limitation of the health care allowance is offset by a rollback of personal payments in the health care sector, resulting in a total cutback of almost 5 billion euros. The limitation of payments to local authorities was not unexpected: many municipalities were already taking into account a reduction in their general benefits. However, this is again not accompanied by a reduction in tasks. On the contrary, the municipalities are given additional tasks without receiving budgetary compensation for them. An example of this is that (again) part of the AWBZ package is transferred to the WMO. The WMO is implemented by the municipalities. The municipalities are also not receiving sufficient compensation for the increase in social assistance benefits. The result of this is that municipal tasks that should be intensified in times of crisis, such as poverty reduction and reintegration, can be carried out less well due to the unilateral restriction of municipal budgets by the government. Reducing development cooperation does not require permission from another body (as is the case with a reduction in EU contributions). It indicates that international solidarity is not a high priority for this proposed government.

182227.0," 2015 10 13 APB, input Peter Schalk, SGPMdV, at the start of my first APB I have some introductory questions for the Prime Minister: Suppose he had to choose between wealth or wisdom, what would his answer be? I estimate that he would choose wisdom. Just like that young King Solomon once did. You know the story: God asked him in a dream to choose what he wanted to receive. Solomon chose wisdom! Our Prime Minister (hopefully) too! Wisdom! A first W!A second question: suppose he had to choose between prosperity and well-being? These are close, but there is a clear distinction: Prosperity offers possibilities, opportunities, new vistas, rich harvests and full barns. But Wellbeing goes deeper, about feelings, about love and affection, about coming home, about warmth and security. Well-being: a second W! Do I want to pit well-being and prosperity against each other? No, certainly not, they can and may strengthen each other. Prosperity is also a great gift, for sure! Prosperity, the third W!WWW = Wisdom <U+0096> Well-being <U+0096> Prosperity, all three are important, but in the right order. In this way they form the guideline for my argument!MdV, I ask these introductory questions for a reason. Because when I leaf through the Budget Memorandum, I notice that it is mainly about figures, economic growth, point clouds and purchasing power maps. Logically, wisdom also includes having your household budget in order. Fortunately, after the contraction and crisis, there is a cautious recovery of the economy. This will create some financial scope. The SGP does note that we must continue to reduce the national debt. It is good that part of the financial space is being used for security within and beyond our national borders. Defense gets a boost; the SGP sees that as a good start. But is this enough? The Van der Staaij motion on next steps in the context of the multi-year perspective of the armed forces received broad support in the House of Representatives.<U+0095> My question is: What next steps will the government take? A more fundamental question fits into this debate in the Senate too.<U+0095> Can the MP briefly explain what went wrong in the past and how those mistakes can be avoided in the future? After all, this is a core task of our government, in which our people are sent on dangerous missions. They deserve respect and it is our duty to care for and equip them well. Our soldiers often operate abroad, where disastrous powers are fighting, between governments or through mutual feuds. The situation in the Middle East remains explosive. The SGP explicitly draws attention to the only democratic constitutional state in that region, Israel. Let us continue to support them and work for good economic relations with them. That promotes peace more than creating an atmosphere of boycott. One more question in this context. In 2016, the Netherlands will hold the presidency of the Council of the European Union.<U+0095> Can the MP indicate how the TK motion on tackling anti-Semitism in Europe will take shape and content in the context of the stated priority? <U+0093>a Union that connects<U+0094>?There are also other forces, namely terror and rebellion: Boko Haram in Nigeria, horrible! IS in Syria, degrading and shocking. The international community must intervene here. The SGP urgently asks to indicate to the United Nations that the priority is not Black Pete, but, for example, standing up for persecuted minorities, of which Christians are the largest and most vulnerable group. MdV, the international community is struggling with the immense problem of the relentless flow of refugees. Entire population groups are staggering towards Europe, immersed in mourning and sadness, sometimes under appalling conditions. This requires special wisdom, also for the longer term. And of course, we do not want to import radical Islam, but as a Christian party we do not reject people. The SGP faction has nothing good to say about cowardly attacks on defenseless and traumatized refugees. And I am ashamed of the tone that the debate sometimes takes. The SGP calls for a balanced approach. This means: mercy and hospitality for real refugees, justice and care for those who can return to their own country. Two questions: <U+0095> Does the MP think it is realistic to quickly separate economic refugees and refugees due to war violence? ?It seems that the police are currently being overextended to ensure safety.<U+0095> Is the government prepared to consider deploying the Royal Military Police, for example, so that refugees can feel safe here?MdV, the problems in the world are big, but there are also issues in our own country. We live in a democratic constitutional state, with unprecedented freedom. On the one hand, that gives rise to gratitude. But the SGP sees that freedom can go too far. When My freedom becomes the measure of all things, when everything and everyone becomes subordinate to my own I. Then I want to go shopping on Sunday, then I want to develop myself, then I go for my own rights! And on the other hand, I cannot ignore it, with pain in my heart I mention the position of unborn children. Their rights don't count. They don't even get freedom! And yet: a child, no matter how young, is a child. MdV, I recently heard a shocking comment about the most unsafe place in the Netherlands, which is the mother's womb! There you have a 15% chance that you will not make it out alive. In our country, 180,000 children are born and 30,000 are aborted every year. 15%! MdV, these cold figures hurt me intensely.<U+0095> Can the MP try to explain how it is possible that this is such a high number?<U+0095> Are these really 30 thousand emergencies? ?<U+0095> Or is there something fundamentally different going on?<U+0095> Does the government have any suggestions to reduce this enormous number?<U+0095> And can the government further promote adequate assistance, so that mothers and fathers are not left out in the cold if they respect the rights of the unborn child? MdV, it takes me some effort to move on to another topic, which is why I am just using those fathers and mothers as a bridge to the families. This government has expressly considered them, given the purchasing power figures. Everyone is improving a little bit, kudos for that. However, the cake must be shared more fairly. There is a significant inequality when it comes to single and dual earners. Research shows that single-income households are fairly evenly distributed across almost all political parties. And if it then turns out that at approximately the average income level, the single-income person pays 5 times as much tax as the dual-income person, then that is simply unfair.<U+0095> What is the government going to do about this in concrete terms?MdV, we want a participation society in which work and care are combined become. But that combination does not work for more than 600,000 people on the street, including many young and elderly people. The efforts to create jobs are to be appreciated. Particularly by reducing labor costs. But paid work is only part of the participation society: there is also unpaid work, in families, in informal care, in volunteer work.<U+0095> My question to the government: how does the government's respect for those who might do not do paid work, but who really participate in society? MdV, I will come back to that young King Solomon: he asked for wisdom, and he received it in abundance. I noticed that our king concluded the speech from the throne on Budget Day with the words: <U+0091>You may feel supported by the realization that many wish you wisdom and are praying with me for strength and God's blessing for you<U+0092> That prayer is always there, within the SGP, but also in many homes and in many churches. It strikes me that I have never heard a prayer for wealth. It is about prosperity for the country and people, i.e. prosperity. Also for peace and blessing, well-being. And, as the king apparently does: for wisdom! I sincerely wish the government that wisdom and God's indispensable blessing. And I look forward to the MP answering my questions. Thank you!

180226.0,"Defeating populism requires more than emphasizing the danger of populists. It is necessary to actually understand the discontent. It is necessary to show that change is possible through serious politics, through cooperation, by bringing back pride. That's what I said tonight at the Hague College. Read my entire speech below. Ladies and gentlemen, ‚ÄúIt feels as if we live in a country without listeners,‚Äù said our king during his Christmas speech. He was referring to the lack of listening ability in our society. I recognize that. Nowadays it seems as if we only shout at each other and no longer listen to each other. This also applies to politics. What explains populism? Where does the dissatisfaction come from? And what do we do about it? Government communication is often about the macro picture of the Netherlands. As if we look at the earth from a satellite and see that our country is doing well. And if you look at the macro figures, things are going very well here. Much better than a few years ago. Much better than in many other places in the world. Just look: More jobs, fewer unemployed, more confidence. Yet the question is whether these slides have made you very happy. Whether you feel proud and whether you are more reassured about the future of your children? There are other images that are much more compelling. Those images make you skeptical or even angry about the good news you hear from politicians. This week I had it again. Beautiful, but if you already have a job it affects you nothing, and if you don't have a job yet you feel extra miserable. Dissatisfaction can best be translated into graphs, but it is better to just ask why someone is angry. For example, let's get into the head of a Dutch truck driver. A job for life. That's what you thought. But suddenly the foreign truck drivers speed past you so that you wonder how much longer you will be behind the wheel. You are increasingly confronted with European rules and red tape of which you do not see the point. And in In the name of efficiency, all your tasks are meticulously described and linked to strict time limits. It all costs you more time. More effort. And while more and more rules are imposed on you, your boss ignores the rules. Are you just like others? for far too little money and for far too many hours behind the wheel? Or do you open your mouth? Suddenly you are in a catch 22. And all the 'choices' you have seem equally bad. Because whether you says no, whether you open your mouth or not. It doesn't matter. You're screwed anyway. Criticism can cost you your job. And then come back to work. While you have to work longer and survive with a meager pension. The future seems bleak, not only for you, but especially for your children. Meanwhile, your world seems to be changing more and more quickly. Your neighborhood. Your street. The football club that you have felt connected to since childhood. On the news you see bloody attacks, far away and close by. On TV they talk about economic growth. In Brussels you no longer have any confidence at all, with backroom politics, waste of money and a sell-out of Dutch values. I have told you nothing new - there are many drivers who tell this. And plasterers, and painters. What processes are behind it? The first is globalization. Growth of global trade relations. Digitalization. Offshoring. Global production chains. Technology. Robotization. Processes over which you as an individual have no influence whatsoever. but you notice the consequences on a daily basis. Which can sometimes grab you by the throat. Of course, globalization has created more prosperity, growth and work. The logistics sector has made significant progress. More packages to deliver means more jobs. The profit is often only there for the people who have already got their affairs in order. The ordinary employee has to settle for less and less security. Liberal politicians and economists have not been honest about this. They have 'sold' globalization as a good investment product , a 'win-win' for everyone, despite the risks. At first glance it sounds good: more trade for the export country the Netherlands. And cheaper products for the consumer. More technology. More convenience. Progress. But let's look at the real benefits. Including the price we pay. The losers. Prosperity is an abstract, uncontrollable and unmeasurable quantity. Much more concrete is the loss of jobs for the less educated due to global competition. The loss of security for the middle class. Many people are demonstrably worse off Research by economist Branko Milanovic shows that between 1998 and 2008, two groups did not benefit from globalization: the poorest five percent of the world's population and the lower middle classes in the Western world. You can see that in this graph. An elephant with the right side a rising trunk: steep income growth of the very richest, the '1 percent'. The graph shows that the majority of the inhabitants of Western countries are not winners but losers. Once the sky seemed the limit. Our economy grew and we shared a firm belief that everyone would benefit. Due to the growth of prosperity, you also saw an increase in social and public facilities. But now we have entered a different phase. Due to our higher wages, entrepreneurs prefer to invest in other countries. And more and more cheap foreign providers smell their opportunities in our developed markets. While the bosses are improving, the future of employees is becoming increasingly uncertain. I have raised this many times over the past four years. By issuing code orange for the negative effects of free movement of work within the EU. But also by, for example, looking critically at the possible impact of the arrival of robots. Globalization is more than just the economy. Globalization is also migration. You can look at the current migration flows from a macro perspective and conclude: everything that moves rubs. That's just the way it is And it will be fine because there has always been migration. But it is too easy to leave it at that. That movement has a direct, concrete impact on individual lives. The real intimidation of gays and women by intolerant minds with a narrow-minded worldview in the reception center that feels like a canary in the coal mine for the tolerance outside soon. The real debates that we have recently been having about issues such as Zwarte Piet and ethnic profiling. And the real hardening of those debates. The real change caused by an asylum seeker center in your neighborhood. Migration has an enormous impact. Not only for the receiving society. Also for the refugees who have given up everything to come here. And also for the 2nd and 3rd generation of migrants. They often literally feel uprooted. They also have a need of certainty in an uncertain world. It raises fundamental questions: can I still be proud of my country? Can we all be that? How do we control all these changes? How do we control migration? As leader of the Netherlands, as prime minister of all Dutch people , you can therefore never take the concerns of one group seriously and those of the other group not. Because the Netherlands belongs to all of us. Another example of a lack of control is the increasing influence of Europe. Europe has brought us a lot of good. Prosperity. Employment. Peace. Cooperation on cross-border problems. International solidarity. We have just not been able to translate those macro benefits into concrete benefits. Many people do not understand abstract Brussels decisions. What they do understand is that what goes wrong: Bureaucratic red tape. Meeting in Strasbourg. Nagging rules. Self-enrichment. Europe has become a symbol for injustice that you as an individual cannot do anything about. I don't think it's surprising that people have little faith in tackling major problems such as the climate or refugees. The power of implementation lags far behind the nice words. And I think It is not surprising that they hit the emergency brakes and vote no. Because what they have received is unfair competition on employment conditions. With more and more foreign employees who work here but do not contribute to our social services. It is a story of losers. The Romanian driver who works far too long hours under bad conditions for next to nothing. And the Dutch trucker who loses his job as a result. The global processes I am talking about together create a dangerous cocktail. Not only for the trucker, but also for the teacher who goes from one zero-hour contract to another. And the cleaner who sees employment conditions evaporate. Dutch people see this decline coming their way. As a result, people who are relatively well off increasingly have a deep sense of vulnerability. People experience too little grip. People experience too little attention. Then there are the populists. But ladies and gentlemen, it is a recipe for new disappointment. Even greater anger. And a risk for the fragile structure that protects our democratic constitutional state. After all, people who raising objections, presenting difficult facts or asking critical questions are quickly undesirable. Judges, for example. Of course also Moroccans, Turks, Muslims, possibly Jews and other minorities. But the press is also a problem because ""too left"" and too concerned with facts. Yet most Dutch people also know: There is no scapegoat. And we cannot go back to the way things were. There is no on/off switch for globalization. It is the failure of politics that people apparently no longer see an alternative. But there are plenty of buttons we can turn. To ensure that everyone benefits, and not just 'the happy few'. At a time when a new American president still delivered a message of hope and optimism instead of standing to shout at the press and anyone who disagrees with him, John F. Kennedy said:¬†Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.‚Äù I would like to place these beautiful words in a different context. Times have changed. And if you look at the past few years, you see that the Dutch have done a tremendous amount for their country. Not just politics, but all of us together. helped this country out of the crisis again. But now that we have made those sacrifices, our country is in a better position again. Now there is plenty of room to really move the Netherlands forward. But then fairer rules are needed. So that everyone can improve And not just people who are already doing extremely well. How do we ensure this? How can we actually reduce the injustice that people experience? As far as I'm concerned, never through false promises or scapegoat politics. No, it requires the radical choice for a strong government that offers citizens protection and space. A government that stands for people. A policy that fights for visible and tangible change in their lives. Although I think it is important to make it clear where the line between good and evil lies for me I also know: You do not take away dissatisfaction by vilifying populist politicians. You take away dissatisfaction by offering an alternative. By offering an antidote to politics that only uses nationalism as a negative instrument to determine who is not included. But also as an alternative to politics that ridicules or makes suspicious the desire for a sense of community and one's own identity. That antidote is pride. Inclusive pride. Pride that you feel, radiate and that you cannot simply let be taken away. Pride that is contagious. Pride that The Netherlands unites and strengthens. For me, Kennedy's words are not just a call to politics. We need to ask ourselves what we can do for our country. I think many Dutch people are already responding to Kennedy's call. As a volunteer, as an informal caregiver. That is why I would also like to present Kennedy's words to another group. The very richest 1 percent. The multinationals that are invited to the annual summit in Davos and were concerned last week while enjoying a glass of champagne about the advancing populism and spoke beautiful and wise words about it. And above all I think that politics must solve it. The multinationals and millionaires spoke in Davos about global cooperation, economic growth, and responsible leadership. But the answers to these important questions are motivated by self-enrichment Multinationals that emphasize the importance of favorable tax rates in order to pay as little tax as possible. Instead of removing the growing dissatisfaction, many participants do exactly the opposite. These Scrooge McDucks from Davos undermine the authority and effectiveness of the government by to avoid taxes through tricks and to further enrich themselves. These multinationals do not realize that they too can only do business thanks to a strong and service-providing government. The good business climate, high-quality workforce, all things that do not come on a silver platter. All things in which a government has a strong hand. But then the government must retain the opportunity to continue investing in people. Globalization is now an unfair board game in which multinationals get billions if they pass the starting box, and the rest gets nothing. It is time for new, fairer rules of the game, so that everyone can win. I am therefore proud of Jeroen Dijsselbloem who last week in Davos, in the lion's den, made a strong appeal to multinationals to simply adhere to the rules. To finally combine their nice words about responsibility with a decent contribution to a just society. 'If you and I pay taxes, then so do the big companies', says @LodewijkA at @HaagschCollege.pic.twitter.com/Ar2u1WiZTC ‚Äî Labor Party (@PvdA) January 23, 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, Fairer and better rules of the game are needed. For multinationals, for the banks, fairer and better rules for our economy, fairer and better rules for the distribution of knowledge, power and income. And fairer and better rules for Dutch employees. And beware: the dissatisfaction becomes stronger when parties flirt with the desire for security but do the opposite. Parties like the VVD also see people's yearning for more security. But if you read their election manifestos, you see that they are throwing sand in people's eyes. With nice words they mislead people. They promise people a permanent job, with a permanent contract. But a permanent contract without dismissal protection. So that more than 5 million Dutch people are no longer protected against arbitrariness and can find themselves on the street at any time. Add to this that, under the guise of freedom, they want to abolish the joy that a collective labor agreement is generally binding. That sounds like abstract technology to most people. And that suits them all too well. Because that way they don't have to explain what it means for you. That it means that you are on your own must negotiate with your employer. That you will personally have to discuss your salary, your employment conditions, your pension, further training and the number of days off you may or may not get. As a result, the person who is willing to accept the worst conditions accept it, get the job. I call that a poison pill for the middle class. Because anyone who wants to destroy employee protection in times of globalization and growing uncertainty does not understand the causes of populism. Then you can put an expensive advertisement in the newspaper about President Trump, but you are letting the Dutch employees down. 'Fairer and better rules are needed for Dutch employees.'@LodewijkA at @HaagschCollege.pic.twitter.com/2qSCDChoZw ‚Äî Labor Party (@PvdA) 23 January 2017 Not to mention the individualization that the VVD advocates in its program, people flirt with the uncertainty about our identity. About the consequences of migration. That is true. We celebrate Christmas in the Netherlands. And Hanukkah and the festival of lights. What is going on here? Fake news is being used here to emphasize that we are in a cultural war and that you are on the right side of the right. But it turned out not to be true. The NPO simply wished us a Merry Christmas, and the @ Minpres herself happy holidays. And we had a wonderful day off on Boxing Day. Just like on New Year's Day. And Easter Monday.... Dutch people have time off on these days because that is arranged in a collective labor agreement. If it is up to the VVD, we will soon be allowed to do so. We still call it Christmas, but we can no longer celebrate it. Then as an employee you can negotiate on your own and choose between wages or time off for Christmas..@LodewijkA at @HaagschCollege about Christmas and collective labor agreements. Don't vote VVD.pic.twitter.com com/TiezxdAMGY ‚Äî Labor Party (@PvdA) January 23, 2017 Save Christmas, don't vote VVD, so a more appropriate statement would have been. These are always examples of a cynical policy that increases people's uncertainty and dissatisfaction. It is a vision to allow people, not companies, to compete with each other. Mark Rutte described vision as the elephant that blocks the view. The VVD program stomps like an elephant about the certainties of the middle class. Mark Rutte has loyally contributed to the Social Agreement, which is was important in times of crisis. But I have no illusions. Halbe Zijlstra is eagerly looking forward to a new cabinet without the PvdA as protector of the employees of the Netherlands. Just as he previously attacked the cultural sector with a demolition hammer, he wants to the elections will destroy social security in the Netherlands. That is the major ideological battle in the socio-economic field these elections. And that is precisely why I am happy with the support of Emiel Roemer and Jesse Klaver for the Progressive Pact for Work that I presented on Saturday. Progressive Netherlands offers a powerful and social alternative to the every-man-for-himself policy of the VVD! Ladies and gentlemen, Anyone who wants to combat the causes of populism must first understand where people's insecurity comes from. And offer serious solutions for this. Against the fear and uncertainty due to migration: Against the fear and uncertainty about the future of our work and income Defeating populism requires more than emphasizing the danger of the populists. However justified. It is necessary to actually understand the dissatisfaction .It is necessary to show that change is possible through serious politics, through cooperation, through bringing back pride. Thank you.

167728.0," Ronald van Raak What would Minister Ollongren have seen when she looked in the mirror this morning? A D66 member who sold her soul in exchange for a ministership? Or a mayor in wartime? Or above all a paladin of Mark Rutte, who wants to deprive citizens of a democratic right, without people being allowed to say anything about it? The first liberal Prime Minister Thorbecke introduced direct suffrage to our country in 1848, and under the liberal Cort van der Linden we received universal suffrage in 1917. However, Mark Rutte wants to abolish a democratic right today by putting an end to the referendum. The Prime Minister is not prepared to defend that decision himself in Parliament, so does his right hand Kajsa Ollongren. Today is a dark day for our democracy, in which citizens are deprived of a democratic right. And why? What have people done wrong? We said 'no' in a referendum on Ukraine. We said 'no' once, to our own government. Against the interests of the multinationals and Europhiles in Brussels. We said 'no' once before our own democracy. That's why we're being punished now. That is why the referendum must now be brought to an end as quickly as possible. The government says the referendum 'did not deliver what was expected'. That is true, but that is mainly due to the actions of the government itself. In 2005, the Netherlands said 'no' in a referendum on the European Constitution, but it was passed anyway. In 2016, we said 'no' again in a referendum on Ukraine, but the government said 'yes' anyway. Now Rutte and Buma, Segers and Pechtold say that you can vote whatever you want in the referendum on the Towing Act, but that they will not care about your choices. The problem is not the referendum, but above all the haughtiness of these politicians. The advisory referendum would be a step towards a binding (corrective) referendum, but after the first 'no', D66, PvdA and GroenLinks did not know how quickly to put their own law in a drawer. Together with VVD, CDA and ChristenUnie, D66 now also wants to abolish the advisory referendum. Their fear is so great that you are no longer allowed to speak out about it. Rutte called it 'logical' that the government wants to abolish the referendum, without a referendum being able to be held on it. Because the government is against the referendum. An argument that fits in a dictatorship, but not in a democracy. According to Mark Rutte, the referendum is incompatible with our representative democracy, where parliament has the final say. But almost all countries in Europe have a referendum, except Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will soon be on that list again. The voters choose the House of Representatives, the people who should represent them. In a referendum, the same citizens can advise and correct their MPs when representatives make decisions that the people do not want at all. That is precisely a crown on democracy, a crown that this government now wants to break. Not because the referendum doesn't work, but because it works too well. Not because it affects democracy, but because it strengthens our democracy. Because so many politicians are so afraid of the opinion of the population. It is certainly no coincidence that the proposal to abolish the referendum has to pass the House so quickly, before the March 21 elections. Then the referendum will also be held on the Towing Act. You can already hear them saying: The referendum has been abolished, why should we still take this Sleep Act referendum seriously? Mark Rutte wants to know everything about you, but not listen to you. Today I will make my voice heard in Parliament, but you can do that too. Now and on March 21. If you don't want to hear, you just have to feel. This certainly applies to Mark Rutte's undemocratic attitude. By saying 'no' to the Towing Act, you can also continue to say 'no' for our democracy.

167845.0,"List of decisions A request has been received to discuss migration. This item will be added to the agenda. After the lunch break, Jasper van Dijk will provide an introduction to this current discussion on behalf of the House of Representatives faction. Van Reybrouck is an archaeologist and cultural historian and is well-known of various books such as Congo, Tegen Elections and Plea for Populism. He is one of the social leaders that Ron Meyer spoke with for his book Grip. The introductory conversation between Meyer and Van Reybrouck is about the excessive power of the market, how we can use this can regain power and what options there are to strengthen democracy. After the discussion, David van Reybrouck answers various questions from the party council about his work, his view of our party, current events and his proposals for more democracy. Party chairman Ron Meyer announces our spokesperson for the House of Representatives faction Jasper van Dijk. Van Dijk mentions the current events and the reason for this discussion. Everyone has seen the Aquarius, the 220 drowning people and the extra migration summit of government leaders. Two days before the Party Council, there was a debate in the House of Representatives. The SP's efforts were in line with our program and party principles. As a party we stand for a fair asylum policy: the aim is to help people in need. We also stand for a realistic asylum policy: there is no room for economic migrants. We want to prevent that people get on rickety boats and become drowning. We say: tackle the root causes. Stop unfair trade. Stop hopeless wars. The West has a role in tackling inequality and offering perspective. We must invest in reception in the region, because it is now miserable. If people flee and come to Europe, how can that be done safely? Via registration centers in the region, for example - although the chance of that happening in the short term is not great. So you can look at that place whether they qualify for asylum. This prevents them from drowning. In Italy, a large number of people have no chance of asylum, illegally, because the majority are economic migrants. Can we prevent them from going to Europe without a chance? Should such an idea get off the ground, the Netherlands must increase the number of people who are eligible for a place in the Netherlands. It is all still theory. If an agreement is reached between government leaders, it will first be submitted to the House of Representatives on the initiative of the SP. Chamber. Our party will not approve inhumane agreements that do not leave people better off on balance. There have been various reactions and questions from the Party Council. It is widely shared that the position of the parliamentary faction is in line with previous agreements in the party and with our program Questions are being asked about the perception as if there has been a change in our course. Are we not following the line of VVD member Azmani too much? A number of speakers have doubts about the possibility of concluding 'deals' with regimes and governments. We are still against the Turkey deal, so how do we ensure that other agreements are accepted? Is that even possible? There is also a broad call to never advocate a fortress Europe, in line with our principles. A number of speakers argue not to talk about 'economic refugees' when it comes to labor migration or wage dumping. Some speakers express their concerns about whether we guarantee asylum procedures in the Netherlands. There are also questions about a maximum number of refugees for a country like Netherlands and about the role of the arms trade. In response to the questions, Van Dijk concludes that there has indeed been no change in course. He reiterates that we were and are against the 'Turkey deal'. He pleads for everything to be done to do to enable safe crossings and safe reception. Stopping the death marches at sea is our goal. As for people who have an economic migration motive, he states that the refugee treaty defines a refugee as fleeing persecution, war and violence That is different from economic migration. If we open the door to all those people, this will be at the expense of support for receiving war refugees. With regard to the numbers that the Netherlands must absorb: our country must take its fair share in proportion to its wealth and population size. That is really not happening now. Arms trade: of course that is part of our analysis. Van Dijk also refers to our campaign led by by Sadet Karabulut 'Not in my name'. We are still against the Azmani plan that he made to allow people to stay here for only a few years. Azmani wanted to lock down Europe - no asylum procedures here. That is This is not an issue for us. But for us the question remains: how do we prevent unsafe crossings? In the debate I told him: if you start working on these types of camps, you also have to invest heavily in those countries. Look at the circumstances: they must meet humanitarian standards. When asked whether we should not follow a more right-wing course, Van Dijk answers that we have our own left-wing story. He quotes Bernie Sanders 'open borders is the right-wing story: how nice it is for companies to bring in everyone so that they have cheap labor'. Van Dijk concludes with the comment that there is still a lot to study and discuss and that the faction and party will certainly do that. From the party council there will be a proposal to discuss this further in depth within the party. The party chairman agrees that this discussion will of course continue to be conducted within the party and promises that it will in any case be reflected in the discussion about our European election programme. Ron Meyer discusses the submitted documents with the Party Council the evaluation. In his introduction he says that we were terribly disappointed with the result. We have discussed it everywhere, within the party and with experts. Today we are establishing our analysis. It is an analysis of all of us and an assignment to all of us. The result is roughly: where we are historically rooted, we win or lose less hard. It is not about handing out more flyers. It is: making sure that you are recognizable and distinctive. Do not reduce the assignments to 'take to the streets more'. Of course, we don't mean aimlessly taking to the streets. The election results are a reflection of current social relations. But we want to change them. With anger and hope. Anyone who thinks that the National Healthcare Fund has not worked: that will not work immediately. Our efforts have laid a solid foundation, but we did not win the elections with them. The shameless secret tax agreements with Shell are systematic. The mold in the houses is mold in the system. Our great task is to solve that great to further develop a convincing vision. In short: proud of the foundation, sober that it will not change immediately. There must be a connection between actions and campaigns. Link the themes: we will link all our actions, initiatives and analyzes with each other and with clear system criticism must be connected. That must be a determined, overarching story. We can make steps in our ideological development, everywhere in the party. Including at the conference where we will discuss an addition to All Humanity: at the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020. In response to the introduction and the evaluation, various department chairs spoke. The responses range from practical comments about corporate identity, media and new campaign resources to fundamental analyzes about being rooted in neighborhoods and combining action and faction. The support for our party among young people and in large cities there is reason for concern. The local parties are a mixed bag in terms of background and positions, but they also have similarities. Both are reason for permanent evaluation and action. In his response, Meyer states that it is about being distinctive and recognizable. Increasing turnout is also a fundamental democratic principle. Connecting better with young people: that is a task for the entire party, not just RED. He shares the conclusion that we were not relevant enough everywhere and that we will work on the conclusions across the board and proposals that we are adopting today. Decision: The proposals in the document 'Evaluation of municipal elections' are adopted. General secretary Lieke Smits takes us through a number of current campaigns. We have had 135 action processes in the past year. Many of them have been won. We have filled the Chass√© with 1200 people. We are going to a sold out Carr√©. We see three themes recurring in all these actions: quality of life, living and public transport. Can we focus these actions? Most of the actions are about living. Mold and rot in the houses symbolize mold and rot in the system. It is injustice that your children are getting sick from this, but we are also going to tackle it together. That is why we want to work with you to build up actions on housing. Tackling the corporations that are making the biggest mess with tenants. Which corporations have plenty of money, with an expensive director, but let the tenants suffer? If they say: ""We have no other choice, it has to be done by The Hague"", then we will also go to The Hague together. Member of Parliament Sandra Beckerman takes the Party Council take us through our actions with tenants. We are going to work even more on those moldy homes: a symbol of how tenants are treated. How housing is no longer a right. So we are mobilizing against mold. We can win that. We will also leading the resistance against the ridiculous European rules that ensure that tenants pay even more taxes to the state. Lieke Smits and Member of Parliament Maarten Hijink explain the state of affairs regarding the National Healthcare Fund. Freezing the deductible is actually one of the first successes of the ZorgFonds. For the first time, it has now been recognized by all parties that the deductible puts a brake on access to care. But we are far from there yet. After the summer, a law will be introduced: more competition between healthcare providers. We want to organize the resistance against this. There is also a lot going on socially. With 700 physiotherapists in action, Zorg in Actie, more than 30,000 people. We also want to ensure that important medications remain in the package - heavy paracetamol, for example, should be removed from the package. These are moments when we will make ourselves heard with the National Healthcare Fund. Member of Parliament Sadet Karabulut and ROOD board member Diyar Jassim speak about our campaign 'Not in my Name'. We are setting up this campaign. We have about refugees, about migration. That discussion is widely held. War creates refugees. War creates an arms race. The arms industry has grown in recent decades. The arms industry benefits from Fortress Europe. We as a party fight for peace policy. How is it possible that this leaders that by deploying a war against terrorism, never talk about the results? We think it is time to have that discussion, collect facts and publish them. The government wants to work in Afghanistan again - boys and girls will soon be there walking around who were not even born at the start of the war in 2001. The permanent war continued in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia. We must now decide not to send soldiers to Afghanistan. Not contributing to more chaos and misery, that's what you have to do. And respect international law. Make peace great again. We will soon go to Brussels. There will be the NATO summit with Trump who is putting pressure on him to give more money to counterproductive wars. And then we will continue, including with local evenings. This is how we build our movement for peace. Sandra Beckerman speaks about climate justice.Capitalism is destroying the world.Shell is in the top 10 of the biggest polluters.And we have climate policies that don't work.The polluters are spared.The Netherlands' emissions are simply increasing.And there is more inequality.Climate has always been important to the SP. The front page of today's AD states: ""SP must fight for climate justice"". This will be an important point in the near future. At the same time, fight for a fair, affordable alternative. And against fracking and gas extraction. We are going to work on climate justice. On October 6, we are organizing a conference on this theme. We will then present big plans! Jasper van Dijk, after a video on this subject, speaks about abolishing the minimum wage for the disabled: 'This is the next step in the destruction of social services. This is an attack on civilization. There is no support for it at all. Even the congresses of the CDA and the Christian Union are against. On August 29 we are organizing an action meeting in Amsterdam. We are summoning the State Secretary van Ark. Because it is unacceptable. Lieke Smits requests permission to place the planning for three upcoming elections on SPnet. Decision: The planning for the Provincial Council elections, European elections and the elections of the Senate in 2019 will be placed on SPnet. Decision : The party council sets up the candidate committee for the elections for the Senate, consisting of Thijs Coppus, Krista van Velzen, Ronald van Raak and Tiny Kox. Treasurer Thijs Coppus explains the accounts. In recent months, the accountant has checked and approved the documents. The financial control committee has checked everything and has a number of recommendations. We broadly adopt their recommendations. The result in 2017 is more than 476 thousand euros. As a party we are also in a good position for the long term. A large part of our assets is in buildings. We add the result to the general reserve. Department chairman Theo Coskun speaks on behalf of the Financial Control Committee: our reserves are increasing and the organization is shrinking. We are here to ensure that we grow. Use those reserves for that. figures are our dashboard.Thijs Coppus also presents the change in the budget for 2018, due to fewer benefits from representatives after the elections and in response to the first quarterly report.Decision: the party council adopts the 2017 annual accounts.Decision: the party council adopts the adjusted budget for 2018. Pim Siegers of the training team announces a number of things regarding ideological deepening in the party, such as the practical and ideological training kits, the evenings around Ron Meyer's book Grip and the US evenings with Jan Marijnissen.

167891.0,"Lilian Marijnissen 'People who believe in justice can no longer afford to remain aloof. It is time to stand up. With anger about current injustice and with the courage and ideas to change that. Because the crises of then and now now prove that the prevailing political ideas and choices are failing. And because together we can do so much better. That is why it is time for a new beginning. That is why it is time for justice.' With these words, SP leader Lilian Marijnissen closed her speech this morning speech on the occasion of the opening of the parliamentary year. Watch or read her entire speech below. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, Many thanks for the invitation. Over the past few months I have learned a lot and met many people. If something is very clear to me has become, then it is that people from The Hague expect so much more than a naked holiday selfie, an uproar over a drawing competition or the latest addition to the integrity lineage of the VVD. People want to hear a story. A story about where our country is going. And rightly so! It is what a former Prime Minister once set himself as a goal: 'The socialist movement will have to continually strive for a combination of reality acceptance and utopia. Of practically constructive reform work and a driving social philosophy.' In other words, a program that is not just is a defense of the existing or fighting the decline, but a direction for the future. You asked me to look ahead to the coming political year. I will do that. I am not sketching you a blueprint - because political blueprints are rarely anywhere good for it - but I would like some perspective. Over the past period I have seen the unease in society grow rapidly about increasing economic injustice. Every time there is jubilation here in The Hague that the crisis is over, many people see their justified distrust in politics has been confirmed. These politicians do not know what is really going on, as many as 6 in 10 people indicate that they do not yet notice that the crisis is over. How is it possible that wages are still not rising fundamentally? ""I think this is the most important theme. And there are two more socially and politically relevant themes in the coming year, namely migration and climate. And I think that these themes are not only important for the world, Europe and our country, but also for my party. When I was allowed to take over from Emile Roemer, who was in this position last year, many told me that they see a lot of potential for the SP on these two themes. And I think that is correct. I want However, let us first start with the concept of freedom. Because for me, justice and freedom are inextricably linked. And it is precisely the value of freedom that has been held hostage in recent decades. Not only by neoliberals, but also by social democrats and even by the stewards of Christian Democracy. Not only by politicians who openly canonize the every-man-for-himself mentality, but also by those who say that the community is important. For the established political order, profit and the market symbolized freedom. Ladies and gentlemen, September 15th is exactly ten years ago that Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. A huge crisis followed. Banks had been given every opportunity by the neoliberal established political order to take irresponsible risks. When things went wrong, it was society that paid the price. Nearly 80,000 healthcare workers lost their jobs , the number of insecure contracts has never been so high, rents have only increased and student financing has been abolished. Is that really freedom? For me, freedom means something completely different: independence! The space to develop yourself, so as not to be in a permanent grip of uncertainty. Not a government that looks away, but a government that provides certainty. Only then will we be able to achieve a just society. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a group of people who works hard every day, doesn't ask for anything in the world, but simply can't make it anymore. People who cannot or barely pay the healthcare costs, who get lost in a jungle of bureaucracy and at the same time have seen certainties disappear. In addition, there are many people who say : things may be going well for me, but not for society. They are concerned about what the future will bring. And perhaps even more importantly: they seriously doubt whether their children will get better. Both groups say: how we organize it now that is unfair. And the figures prove them right. Let's name a few: Corporate profits are currently higher than ever, but an increasingly smaller share goes to workers: of every euro earned, at the end of the last century 81 cents to employees, now only 73 cents. The result: Profit payments to shareholders exploded, while people have hardly improved in real disposable income for forty years. What justice? Whose freedom? Companies contributed less and less to us country. During my lifetime, the profit tax has been halved. It fell from 48 to 25% and even further in the coming period if it were up to Rutte. At the same time, people started contributing more and more. But they got less and less in return. Look at how our public sector has fared it squeaks and creaks. The healthcare providers, the teachers, the police officers, the bus drivers: they all suffer from an enormous workload, are hopelessly underpaid and suffer daily from organized distrust. And they all have to take action for something so normal. as: being able to do their work well at a decent valuation. That is why the abolition of dividend tax represents so much more than just a 2 billion gift voucher to the foreign owners of multinationals. It symbolizes the sacred belief in shareholder capitalism that has gone awry. is the symbol for many people that politics is not there for them. It is raw capitalism par excellence. That raw capitalism that Gert-Jan Segers recently said he wants to combat. I am very curious how he thinks it will lead to is now going in the cabinet with the VVD. Because last summer Mark Rutte was desperately looking for 500 million euros because the dividend tax threatens to cost not 1.4, not 1.6 but 2 billion euros. At the same time, State Secretary Van Ark is coming one of these days with the proposal to allow people with disabilities to work below the minimum wage. And there are many similarities with the dividend tax: What justice? Whose freedom? I don't think we can get a clearer picture of the VVD agenda. Society and civilization are insulted with an attack on the minimum wage, but in the meantime, while all arguments have run out, Rutte continues to insist on giving away 2 billion that no one understands. And perhaps Mr Buma can say something about that, but as I understand it This is so valuable to the VVD that they are willing to sacrifice the survival of the cabinet for it. The arrogance of power. It is the leader of a country who gives away billions from society to a handful of super-rich after phone calls from a handful of friends, while people talk about it never - even indirectly - had anything to say. First there were no memories, then there were memories, first there were no documents, then there were documents. But when the memories and documents finally surfaced, it was revealed whose interest the Prime Minister serves here He does not serve the interests of all Dutch people, he serves the interests of a number of foreign shareholders and demonstrably of his own former employer Unilever. It was not part of the election campaign, people did not know that they would also vote on this and a means that is now The referendum, as one of the first acts of this cabinet, was immediately destroyed. So before the decision was made, people were not allowed to think anything of it and once the decision has been made people still don't like it. If we were talking about a country elsewhere in the world, we would without hesitation call these kinds of practices morally corrupt. Mark Rutte is not the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, but of a maximum of 76 people who are held hostage by a very limited definition of democracy Ladies and gentlemen, Then a less complicated and charged theme: Migration... No, that is a very complicated subject. For Europe, for our country and I will say it honestly: I have noticed also for our party. But that should of course not be a reason to avoid it. That is not possible. We will even interrupt our next general reflections for a day because there is another European summit on this subject. We are quite critical of the role of Europe, but Collaboration is more necessary than ever on these types of themes. Unfortunately, we see the opposite every day. European countries are hopelessly divided, pointing fingers at each other and people on the run threaten to become the playthings of a fissuring European policy. And yes, the The term raw capitalism has already been used. Because that is where it starts. As long as inequality grows worldwide, migration will continue to increase. People are looking for a better future. And who can blame them? We cannot possibly continue to hold on to the unfair neoliberal trade agreements with which multinationals are emptying an entire continent without wanting to pay a fair price. That has nothing to do with justice. We have been seeing boats arriving for some time, in Greece, in Italy, in Spain. Just yesterday the UNHCR stated that the Mediterranean Sea is one of the deadliest routes in the world: 1 in 18 people die. The conditions are inhumane for the people who come by boat and unjust because the most vulnerable people are financially or physically unable to get into such a boat. That must change. That is why we opt for justice. A policy that makes migration fair and manageable. We will therefore have to organize the asylum procedure and reception closer to people. So that people do not have to make the death journey across the Mediterranean. That is why we are in favor of investigating the possibilities of regional reception and registration centers, in accordance with our standards, in Africa. And we will also have to be clear. We will accommodate people who are fleeing war, violence or oppression. And the Netherlands must then do its fair share But there is no future here for people who come our way with purely an economic motive. Making migration more manageable, as a counterpart to open borders politics, is a left-wing story. For the simple reason that it is fairer for people here and there.It combats the root causes, makes the terrible death marches redundant, opposes the politics of divide and rule and prevents even more from being asked of our poorest cities and neighborhoods.It is a just migration policy based on human dignity, equality and solidarity.Ladies and gentlemen, Anyone who thinks about the future, thinks about our climate. The time for sitting still is definitely over. It is not without reason that we signed the Climate Act. An initiative law together with the coalition is something we as SP do not do every day. But our companies , homes and society will switch to clean and healthy energy. However, the big debate for the coming period will be: who pays and who benefits? Currently, the 100 largest companies in the world cause almost 80% of the climate costs. Currently paying Dutch companies pollute 1.8 billion less, households 2.8 billion more. The rate that the Shells of this world pay for their energy is a hundred times lower than you and I pay. That is not climate justice. That is cheating people. What justice? Whose freedom? We will not cooperate with climate policy that does not take into account society. We will not cooperate with a policy that lets the major polluters go free but gives people a significant increase in their energy bills. Because it is not only not fair, it will also not work. There will be no support for costly climate measures unless we organize it fairly. I will give you an example. In the Liendert district of Amersfoort there are flats from the 1960s. No significant maintenance has ever been carried out there. The kitchens are falling apart in misery, the shower is full of mold and hanging up curtains: that's not an option because the walls are too bad for that. Recently the housing association finally came up with a renovation plan for the houses. But what do you think? They didn't want to do anything to the kitchen, nothing to the walls, nothing on the shower. No, the residents got solar panels on the roof. No improvements in the house, only on the house. And they had to be happy with that too. These residents initially had nothing against solar panels, but now they do. They say, get rid of your solar panels, we first want a decent house in which we can live healthily every day. This is not how it should be done. If we want to realize this gigantic challenge for the future, we will have to tackle the major polluters and not saddle people with enormous costs. I read that Mr Buma is also concerned with us about where the bill for these climate measures will be and whether this will be done fairly. I think that is right, because this will affect the debate in the in the coming period. I will be very clear: the climate goals must be achieved, but that will be done in a fair manner or it will not happen. And we will support any measure that brings climate justice closer. Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion: Thank you thank you for the invitation to this special morning. I can invite you too. For Saturday September 15, ten years after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the start of the crisis: at the foot of the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, the weekend before Prinsjesdag I would like to invite you all to my Speech for Justice and an exciting new initiative. You don't have to agree with everything I say. But people who believe in justice can no longer afford to remain aloof. It is time to stand up. With anger about current injustice and with the courage and ideas to change it. Because the crises of then and now prove that the prevailing political ideas and choices are failing desperately. And because together we can be so much better That's why it's time for a new beginning. That's why it's time for justice. I thank you. It's time for justice!

162050.0," The European gentlemen's agreement between banks and governments against the dumping of Southern European bonds is not working. This has become clear now that it appears that Ageas, the former Belgian part of Fortis, has sold no less than 4.8 billion worth of Southern European government bonds. SP MP Ewout Irrgang demands that the Minister of Finance, together with the other European ministers, make enforceable agreements against the dumping of bonds. When interest rates on Greek government bonds started to rise very high, the European Central Bank deployed a new tool. She started buying government bonds from financial institutions to lower interest rates. Although this calmed the financial market, it also created the opportunity for banks and insurers to easily discharge their Southern European bonds. Instead of the governments themselves putting a stop to the massive dumping of Southern European bonds, they left agreements about this to the banks and insurers themselves. ‚ÄúThat's like taking the bait,‚Äù says SP MP Ewout Irrgang. ‚ÄúThe banks and insurers are not strict enough on themselves and do not impose sanctions on the massive dumping of bonds at the ECB. Parties that do not adhere to the gentlemen's agreement are now richly rewarded for this.‚Äù In just over a week, Ageas sold 1.7 billion euros in Greek bonds, 2.1 billion euros in Italian bonds and 900 million euros in Portuguese bonds. For example, it used the ECB's purchasing policy against agreements to get rid of its risky bonds en masse.

183038.0," We live in historic times and I can announce: we have reached a historic agreement. I am proud of it. Proud that I can stand here on behalf of our one and a half million voters and say to all those people: your vote has caused a new wind to blow in the Netherlands. Thanks to you, the Netherlands will soon become safer, the numbers of asylum seekers and immigrants will be reduced significantly and significant investments will be made in elderly care. I therefore do not hesitate to use the word 'historic' today. Because I think that today we are sealing something that could have far-reaching consequences for the Netherlands. Our country is taking unprecedented measures to stem the influx of asylum seekers and immigrants. The aim of this political cooperation is that all these measures should lead to a quarter less asylum flow and a thirty percent less regular influx, including family migration. And when it comes to the numbers of non-Western immigrants, the new measures can lead to as much as 50% less influx. Illegal stay becomes punishable. And there will be a burqa ban. Unprecedented measures and unprecedented figures for the Netherlands. Then an important point for the PVV that we have achieved: denaturalization. The PVV has been vilified for years because we believe that the Dutch citizenship of criminals with dual nationality should be revoked. Now that's going to happen, and throwing a hat at it during the integration course means from now on: losing your residence permit forever. Then safety. We are also making a profit on this. Finally, ordinary citizens are central and no longer the interests of criminals. A trend break has also been achieved in this area. Tough measures are coming. Three thousand police officers (including 500 animal cops). The Netherlands will become safer. Also because minimum sentences will finally be introduced for repeat offenders. Street terror is being tackled harshly. TBS will be cut back and something will be done about the probationary leave! The Party for Freedom entered the elections as the party par excellence for the ordinary hardworking people of the Netherlands, the people who do not get it as a gift. No less than 18 billion are being cut ‚Äì an enormous amount. But after years of socialist bluster by Wouter Bos, this could not continue forever. We cannot saddle the children of the Netherlands with ever-increasing government spending. Real social policy, that is a decent budget. Intervention had to be taken and that is happening. But 18 billion in reductions appears to be possible - on average even without a loss of purchasing power for the working people of the Netherlands. I can say with great pride that the interventions in social security are limited. The Freedom Party has fought to keep our welfare state afloat. We succeeded. Dismissal law will remain unchanged during the coming cabinet period. The duration of unemployment benefits will also not be changed. With our support, the state pension age will not be raised to 67 but to 66. The benefits are not frozen. Then the elderly care. We really fought hard for this. There will be almost one billion euros extra on a structural basis for care for the elderly. No fewer than 12,000 extra nurses will be added for the daily care of our elderly. This billion also puts an end to the 24-hour veils. But there's more. Nearly 2 billion in cuts to Home Care (Wmo) and increases in the Personal Contribution for residents of care institutions have been canceled. A package to be proud of. We are therefore proud of this tolerance agreement. The Netherlands will benefit from this. The Party for Freedom will prove itself to be a reliable partner in the coming years. We are good at our signature and have confidence in our partners. We are completely ready for it.

164509.0," D66 released a vision of the future of Europe this week. It would even be about a 'radiant future'. That seems nice and idealistic. However, if you read more closely, you will see that the vision is still based on outdated neoliberal ideas. The aim of the European Union is first and foremost to become an economic bloc that can compete with other continents. People and certainly the human dimension are subordinated to this. The opposite applies to the SP: we put people first and listen to all those Dutch people who say that things are going a bit fast, that we have to ensure that national democracy is not undermined by Brussels and that we do most things close to home. can continue to regulate without interference from Brussels. Next week we will vote on the 2-pack in the European Parliament. Some immediately made a connection with the rapper from the '90s, but nothing could be further from the truth. The 2pack aims to ensure that in the future the European Commission can first make a decision on the national draft budget before it is presented to the House of Representatives. The position of national parliaments is thus deliberately further eroded to the benefit of the 'European economic government'. An unattractive thought for us as SP members, especially since the Commission is actually only allowed to assess budgetary standards. A draft budget that temporarily exceeds the 3% budget deficit will undoubtedly receive a negative assessment from the Commission, and the government will then have to do its homework again within two weeks, even if the majority of the House of Representatives were to agree. Brussels has gone completely crazy here, but I fear that the European Parliament will adopt the proposals. The EP thus supports the vision also supported by D66. The more power to Brussels, the better. According to that party, it is high time for the United States of Europe. Only: most people don't want this. They prefer to see increasingly closer cooperation and want to participate in decision-making if further power is transferred to Brussels. They have no need for the neoliberal ideology, which has caused the entire economic crisis. Based on that consideration, D66 should also consider whether it is human to always give priority to 'competitiveness', even if this means that you have increasingly larger, less human connections everywhere. With the political institutions in Brussels that are much further removed from the people, and with companies that go along with the drive for concentration in order to remain competitive. Such a future of colossi may shine, but especially from the mirror walls that we know from the office districts, certainly not from the faces of ordinary people.

I have drawn up an action plan (pdf) with proposals that should lead to better working conditions for workers from Central and Eastern Europe and to combat unfair competition. Most Eastern European employees are completely dependent on the employment agency they work for. Rogue employment agencies and their rogue buyers exploit this relationship of dependence. We want to put an end to this. Action plan Stop exploitation of Eastern European workers The PvdA wants high fines for major violations. An administrative fine of just a few thousand euros is a joke for rogue employment agencies and their customers. We need to increase the fines significantly. The PvdA also advocates mandatory certification for employment agencies, with strict standards. To prevent unfair competition between Dutch and Polish employees, the PvdA wants to oblige customers to pay at least the collective labor agreement wage instead of the minimum wage. By deploying additional labor inspectors, the PvdA wants to increase the chance of detection of rogue companies. We also want to expand the work permit requirement for Bulgarian and Romanian employees. Romanian and Bulgarian companies can allow their employees to work in the Netherlands without a work permit. This must come to an end. In neighboring countries, these employees must apply for a work permit and this is permitted under European law. Many new workers from Central and Eastern Europe offer themselves as self-employed at bargain rates. Often far below the minimum wage. The PvdA wants this to stop. We call on the social partners in the sectors where these problems occur to take measures before the summer. If not, we want to introduce minimum rates for self-employed people, starting with the sectors with the biggest problems. The abuse of the self-employed construction to avoid the minimum wage must stop. Dutch employees who want a normal wage for their work no longer stand a chance on the labor market. EU citizens cannot be obliged to integrate. The PvdA therefore wants to broaden compulsory education so that adult immigrants from EU countries can also be included. For example, parents with school-age children may be required to learn Dutch and take an integration course. The coalition of CDA, VVD and PVV makes the naive mistake of claiming that these people will go back. It would be a historical mistake not to allow Eastern Europeans to integrate. The PvdA also advocates mandatory registration in the population register and a tough approach to slum landlords.

182030.0,"Imagine that each party is allowed to organize a working visit for the cabinet and House of Representatives. To bring everyone face to face with the facts. Like: look, this is going wrong! Or on the positive side: this is an inspiring place. Then you ask you wonder: where would we take each other? The VVD?<U+0096> I wouldn't be surprised if the VVD takes us to a transport company in Twente. Nice company, hard workers. Look people, this is what the money is for the BV Netherlands has earned, Zijlstra beams. The entrepreneur nods, but adds: <U+0093> that excise duty increase is not going to work, people are all going to fill up abroad.<U+0094> He is right! Sir the Prime Minister, what is your answer to this? Then the PvdA. Samsom is going to surprise. Also to a company! A special company indeed: Fokker, in Hoogeveen. They do something with parts of fighter planes. The director enthusiastically slaps Samsom on the shoulder.Thanks man, <U+0093>I expect enormous job growth due to the government's policy!<U+0094> That<U+0092>is good news for a Labor Party, I would say. Let's get to Wilders.What is that right? He doesn't want to take us with him! Why not? His motivation: <U+0094>I think it's too boring, going on a working visit together. Just as if we all really want to tackle the problems together. There I actually oppose it.<U+0094>Roemer is milder. He has his eye on a grower near the Land of Once. His Dutch tomatoes are now also in danger of being picked by Romanians and Bulgarians. .<U+0093>How many times have we said it,<U+0094> says Roemer: <U+0093>Learn the lessons of the past!<U+0094> I think he has a point. Does the Prime Minister think so too? It is Buma's turn. Everyone is genuinely curious about where the CDA actually wants to go. Buma has thought about it carefully. It will be a conversation with former prime ministers from the CDA house: De Jong, Van Agt, Lubbers, Balkenende. The former prime ministers have a clear message: The Netherlands will become ungovernable unless the CDA becomes bigger and the government smaller. Buma nods with satisfaction. Slob<U+0092>'s choice is surprising. He wants to go to the red light district, the Red Light District in Amsterdam. He is right! Let everyone hear how many people there end up in prostitution due to an accumulation of problems, and then become entangled in it against their will! Green Left: That party is going to do something sustainable. Electric cars<U+0092>s run like clockwork in Germany, says Van Ojik. In the Netherlands, they don't. It's time for the government to plug it in, he says. Justified question: what can we learn from <U+0091? >clean and economical<U+0092> in Germany?Thieme takes us to the Hedwigepolder in Zeeland.To show us how beautiful it will be with those avocets and oystercatchers later.But I see pheasants and hares, and in the distance a farmer on his tractor, plowing in a beautiful polder. Well<U+0085>.¬†¬†¬†Krol? He doesn't have to go far.<U+0093>Just go out into the street here in The Hague and listen to all those poor people over 50. You can just taste and smell the dissatisfaction, says Krol.<U+0094> That is true, especially among those people with a small or no pension at all. A group to keep a close eye on. But what about that large group of wealthy elderly people? Deception by people under 50, says Krol decisively. And what does the Prime Minister? Who am I forgetting? Oh, yes, colleague Pechtold! I didn't think so? It will be a walk on the beach in Scheveningen. Clear, transparent, nothing, no back rooms or back seats. We are going to the pier, there is now Pechtold's Fun Palace .Downstairs a coffee shop, with its own cannabis plantation. Above that a mega caf√©, also for under 18s. On the top floor there is a casino with many one-armed bandits. On the way to the exit we come across a special room: a treatment room for all types of refusing people, Pechtold explains. But now the question: what does the SGP choose? Where would I Shall we just go to a family with three school-age children? In Scherpenzeel, or in Medemblik. I expect strong texts. <U+0093>Dear politicians, we have done some calculations. Do you know that due to the tax measures, the reduction in child benefit and <U+0091>book money<U+0092> will ultimately result in a loss of about <U+0092>2,500 euros. And the lady from Medemblik wonders in bewilderment why she is being punished for her care responsibilities. She says: <U+0093>I miss out on the tax dual-income bonus because I spend a lot of time caring for my sick mother and my disabled son. Phew, says the tax authorities, you don't have a job! And soon it will also be The SGP agrees with that gentleman from Scherpenzeel and that lady from Medemblik! Families that are already having a hard time financially are still having a hard time. The gap between single and dual earners is becoming much wider, while it was already enormous. A single-income family with 40,000 euros will soon have to pay 11,000 euros in tax. A dual-income family with the same income together will pay only 4,000 euros. A single-income family therefore has 600 euros less to spend per month. And then the new plans also lead to sky-high rates for every extra euro earned. The single-income family who earns 40,000 and manages to earn an extra 1,000 euros has to give up half of that again. at the tax authorities. And if you exceed 56,000 euros, the rate is even 60%. The Netherlands has too many income-related schemes. We already had the housing allowance, the healthcare allowance, the child-related budget and the student finance, which reduces the return on every extra euro earned. But now the income-related general tax credit and the employed person's tax credit have been added to this. To make a long story short: We cannot say <U+0093>yes<U+0094> to these plans. This really needs to change.I hear I would like to hear the government's response. And do you know who you should talk to, says the gentleman from Scherpenzeel? With the informal caregivers! If you really want to make that move towards more care for each other, you should focus more on relieving the burden on the already overburdened informal caregivers. Good point! Does the cabinet see opportunities to give the municipalities extra money for this so-called respite care? It could be that that lady from Medemblik would also raise a completely different point.<U+0093>Do you think so too? still adhere to the values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms? I have rarely been as angry as I was recently. I heard a radio advertisement that calls on people who are happily married to visit a site to avoid cheating. Isn't that just bawdy?<U+0094>Totally agree Agree! You really don't have to be an SGP member to be angry about this. A TNS-Nipo study that we commissioned shows that a lot of people are annoyed by this. Why do politicians look away from this? Dare to think about this to take a clear stand! And if you don't want to restrict those advertisements, then force those cheating sites to include a leaflet: <U+0093>Cheating is detrimental to children<U+0094> We know that cheating leads to divorces. leads, with all the social consequences and costs that entails? I would like to hear a clear response from the cabinet! Shall we also go to a <U+0091>charity<U+0092>? The Orange Fund, for example, or to the Army of the Salvation, or to Prison Care, or to the cooperating health funds. And don't forget the churches! There are so many volunteers in our country. Does the cabinet see them? Not to fill the gaps in the national budget, but as indispensable allies from the society itself. Shall we also go to that shelter for unwanted pregnant women? A young woman told me: <U+0093> When I became pregnant accidentally, people around me said: why don't you just opt ‚Äã‚Äãfor an abortion? It will be fully reimbursed , it's running smoothly<U+0085>. But she said: I don't want to kill another life. I've seen an ultrasound of the baby, and I don't have the heart to let that life be killed Also sign the European citizens' initiative <U+0091>one of us<U+0092>,<U+0094> she encouraged us to contribute to legal protection for early life. It is still possible!And then one more thing: you know what I don't understand? If even the liberal abortion law that we have in the Netherlands assumes that abortion is only allowed in an unavoidable emergency, then you can't tell me that this is the case more than 30,000 times a year. Wouldn't that at least change the policy? should be done to prevent these emergencies as much as possible? I would like to forward that question from that unwanted pregnant woman to the cabinet! Plenty to do in the interior. But I would also like to cross the borders on a working visit. Will we go to Israel and hear about good cooperation projects between Israelis and Palestinians there. To hear from both sides how unwise the policy is to prevent companies from doing business in the disputed areas. What Is that crazy to say: don't build that water purification plant? Is the government prepared to stop this counterproductive discouragement policy? Let us continue to travel in the region. Shall we talk to the Copts in Egypt, with Christian refugees from Iraq and Syria, for example. Many feel abandoned by the West. Of course we say: you must have an eye for all people, and the misery here affects many groups. But don't forget, they say: <U+0093>You have Sunni countries that help Sunnis. And Shiite countries help their Shiites. But who does anyone still have an eye for the Christians? Those Copts and Christian refugees from Syria and Iraq say: don't be naive, don't you see that the Islamists are simply trying to drive the Christians out of our entire region. And what are you doing in the west? ?Organizing conferences on Islamophobia<U+0085> That's turning the world upside down! Or would it be possible without a working visit to make combating religious persecution a recognizable policy spearhead in the new human rights policy? All those struggles and wars and attacks worldwide make it clear that world peace has certainly not yet broken out. Good question to see whether our defense is in order... I'm afraid the answer is <U+0091>no<U+0092> Shall we go to a barracks in Ermelo or Assen to hear from the military what they think about the unprecedented destruction of Defense? There is no end to the looting of defense funds! Isn't it finally time to go to defense? the soldiers ask us? Don't you also think they are right? I ask the cabinet. There are plenty of ideas for working visits. But imagine if the other factions and the cabinet were to say: Dear SGP, that long list of visits can be added to we don't start. You really have to choose 1, which shows as strongly as possible where the heart of your party lies. Then I would take a completely different approach. I have a proposal. Shall we go to Noah's Ark go? No, I am not inviting you to Mount Ararat in Turkey, but to the beautiful replica ark that is still moored in Dordrecht. It is an impressive, immense building, the realization of the dream of Johan Huibers, an enterprising carpenter from North Holland. Visitors from all over the world come to see it. Do you know what I find so inspiring? That the ark was built after all, even though the builder encountered an incredible number of obstacles on his way. Of course people said: you can do this never, you are not wise. Of course, many governments had to scratch their heads: an ark is not included in the building decree. But the builder just got to work. That is a mentality that the Netherlands needs, especially in times of crisis. Seeing possibilities, not difficulties! The construction industry also desperately needs this. The SGP has made concrete proposals for this. Is the cabinet really working on fewer rules and less bureaucracy? Also in healthcare? Also in education? The ark is not just a building There is a special reason why my heart beats faster during this construction project. That of course has everything to do with the symbolism, the message of this ark. If you ask the builder in Dordrecht: why did you build the ark? Then he says: he: <U+0093>To point out to people the love of God and the need to take Him seriously.<U+0094>Beautifully said. A message of seriousness. Once when Noah was building, he was not taken very seriously. His warnings about injustice and wickedness were massively ignored. The consequences were catastrophic. Many centuries later, Jesus returns to Noah's ark in his preaching. In the future it will be this way, he says, that people's behavior would be the same as in the days of Noah. And what was wrong? Then you expect a list of terrible things. But then follows: eating, drinking, getting married. Nothing wrong with that, right? Not at first glance. But if that is all there is to it, if God is completely missing, if there is no regard for His good commandments, if it is only about purchasing power and the economy, then we not only have an economic crisis, but this also marks a poignant spiritual crisis. That is the seriousness, even now. But the ark is also a message of love, of security. Salvation and renewal are possible for every person, whoever he or she is and whatever he or she is doing. Jesus Christ is the Ark of Salvation. With Him there is life, perspective, security. It is gratifying that that message is increasingly catching on in so many places in the world, from China to South America. Turn around. Look further. Look up. Then the weather is not always nice, and a lot of rain can still fall. But then sometimes you suddenly see a rainbow in the clouds. As a sign of God's faithfulness.

166840.0," Anne-Marie Mineur Even without the European Parliament having been able to vote on it, the European Commission can provisionally bring into force trade agreements such as TTIP, CETA and TiSA. The SP finds this unacceptable and therefore urgently calls on the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, not to ratify such treaties before the European Parliament has had a chance to consider them. SP MEP Anne-Marie Mineur calls on her colleagues to co-sign the letter: ‚ÄúWe advocate submitting such treaties in their entirety to the national parliaments, and we also believe that there should be a referendum on this. The trade barriers that are now being removed are in fact the rules that protect our trade union rights, our health and our environment. Our population must be able to have a say in this. It now appears that these treaties can be introduced even without the consent of the European Parliament. The leaders of government, united in the European Council, must not allow this to happen.‚Äù After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, concluding trade agreements became a competence of the European Commission.

166929.0,"Hans van Heijningen opens the Party Council. Following the report of the Party Council of November 21, 2015, Paul Grevelt (Cuijk) has a question for Ronald van Raak. During the previous Party Council, Ronald announced that he would submit a request to give Salafist organizations more How did this end? Ronald announced today that Emile Roemer and Halbe Zijlstra have jointly submitted a motion to investigate Salafist organizations, and this has been adopted in the House of Representatives. Hans announces that this afternoon travels to Turkey to visit the HDP party. He will represent the SP at their conference this weekend. Today the Party Council will elect a new appeals committee from its ranks. The Party Board's proposal will be adopted by those present. The following members have been appointed by the Party council appointed to the appeal committee: Willem Bouman (chairman, second term), Hans Boerwinkel (department chairman Doetinchem), Hasan Inekci (department chairman Nieuwegein), Tamara Koppelaar (department chairman Rheden) and Tonnie Wouters (department chairman Schijndel). The previous appeal committee is thanked for its commitment. In addition to chairman Willem Bouman, this consisted of Fenna Feenstra, John van den Heuvel, Bets Beltman and Frank Futselaar. Vincent Mulder makes an announcement about Rosita van Gijlswijk. Rosita has been elected as a DB member, but is not present today. Rosita has been a member for a long time. time 50% in the sick pay. A number of tasks have been taken away from Rosita, so that she can recover. Her most important task is and remains the payment of representatives. This is a difficult decision for Rosita, but Rosita's recovery is for her and the party of of great importance. Get well wishes will be sent to her on behalf of the Party Council. Ron Meyer then speaks about his working method after his election as Party Chairman, seven weeks ago. He starts with a film that is part of the Bernie Sanders campaign, Killer Mike holds a spectacular speech.Ron explains why he wanted to show this fragment.It is about Sanders' mission, his own mission, but in the speech he also gives assignments to the listeners.Be brave, be combative and be daring.Ron has the In recent weeks, we have had discussions with employees in De Moed, and have now started discussions with the parliamentary faction. Ron has also paid many visits to departments and regional consultations in recent weeks. There is a healthy form of impatience in departments and in De Moed. does not always lead to the best choices, but they are a driving force. Ron indicates that he is proud of the many party members he has spoken to. In De Moed there is a need for clear choices and more guidance. There is also a wish for more creativity, new impetus, and a different way of training or deepening for active executives. There is a desire for offensive campaigns, strengthening the foundations and going all out on the offensive. During the party board meeting of January, a decision was made about the composition and mutual division of tasks within the executive board. Lieke Smits and Pim Siegers have been elected by the party board as members of the executive board. Pim will manage the training team/study center. Lieke Smits is responsible for campaigns. Party secretary Hans van Heijningen is primarily responsible for carrying out the resolution. For this purpose, he often travels around the country to the departments. Preparing the election campaign and the 2017 conference are also Hans' tasks, as well as coordinating international activities. Hans also managed the Moed. This task has been taken over by Vincent Mulder. He is tasked with transforming the Moed from party office to campaign center. Emile is our party leader in the House of Representatives and is given plenty of space to gain inspiration and get into attack mode. Rosita van Gijlswijk has been elected as a member of the Executive Board but now temporarily absent and its tasks are temporarily taken over by Vincent and Hans. As party chairman, Ron will lead the major campaign around public basic insurance. He will also make many visits to the departments and regions. It is also his job to to continue formulating a vision, also in the medium and long term, and to safeguard the unity of the party. The ten assignments and the nine motions from the resolution will be discussed step by step and in phases during the Party Council. Not everything can be implemented in the coming months. Hans will come back to this later in the day. Ron presents the campaign structure for the coming years. Fight together, win together. Well thought-out plans, clear agreements, making choices and priorities and with that, also at a local level, achieving successes. The party board will make choices. Departments can also make that decision themselves. No longer are all campaigns mandatory for the department. Three types of campaigns. During the Party Council, Ron had a conversation with a number of party members from the country about their initiatives to organize a Super Saturday at short notice. He speaks about this with Marianne Laumann (Kerkrade), Hanne Drost (The Hague), Milos Todorovic (Utrecht) and Barend Hoogteijling (regional representative North Brabant ZO). Ron also gives the floor to Leo de Kleijn, Rotterdam. In the coming years, 20,000 rental properties will disappear in Rotterdam. The entire public housing system will be turned upside down and is in danger of no longer existing. The SP has taken the initiative for a referendum; we do not want these plans. Opportunity to enter all neighborhoods in Rotterdam. In terms of content, a point where a large part of the population supports us. SP members, other active people and tenants' associations are mobilized and informed in the neighborhoods. These concrete You can win the campaign, it will make members active. 10,000 signatures are needed. The national party will support the campaign. Ron also speaks with two fellow party members from the province of Groningen. Sandra Beckerman, party leader of the States Party of Groningen, and Marieke Bootsma, SP Bedum In Groningen they look for local heroes. Ask at the door: who ensures the quality of life in the village? These people are put in the spotlight. In Onderdendam, a prize was awarded yesterday to a local hero. 1 in 10 inhabitants were present. The Staten faction supports the departments and the working groups. The SP is looking for heroes throughout Groningen, also in the 3-4 municipalities where there is no local SP department yet. A start will soon be made in Winsum. Ron asks departments to respond Jan Breur, Veenendaal. Appreciates Ron's proposal to implement the conference resolution in phases. Suggests that if you want innovation, the departments themselves should also get started. Organize your own actions, theme meetings and call on the national SP. Do not wait as departments. Ron's response: conscious choice not to do everything at once. Is happy with the call to set up inspiring actions yourself. Ron indicates that when he joins a department, he plans wants to know about the department. Lieke will make an inventory of all local, regional and national actions and determine with the departments where support is needed. Daan Brandenbarg, Groningen: finds the campaign plan enlightening. In phases, timetable and divided into types of campaigns. Daan sees many opportunities in the campaign for public basic insurance. Appreciates the expansion of the executive board. Paul Grevelt, Cuijk: He wonders whether the Party Council should adopt the new text of the resolution. Hans responds to this question in a next agenda item. Leo de Kleijn, Rotterdam: is very happy with Ron's presentation about the campaign plan. An advantage is that you can tackle and support the campaigns well. In the past, campaigns sometimes lacked a goal, a head and an end. Present clearly what is expected of departments and what you want to gain. Ron's response: a campaign is a attack plan, needs a head and tail. Agrees with Leo. Hans van Leeuwen, Leidschendam: has a question about the public health insurance campaign. How are we going to involve other social organizations in this? Ron's response: We need to recruit a lot of people get our side so that other political parties also have to agree with the people. We will also look for other organizations that want to join. Nico Heijmans, Den Bosch: What do you think you will do about the image of the party, are we a bit too have we become cautious and should we show more courage? Ron's response: Nico's conclusion is that we have become a good party, so come on with your ideas. Courageous ideas are welcome. Tiny Kox, party chairman of the Senate: Tiny joins us to the story of Leo de Kleijn. Dare to fight, dare to win. Ukraine referendum, 2017 elections, public basic insurance; we must win, we can win. Departments must understand that they can enter into the battle themselves and win. Tiny emphasizes that the Senate members are happy to come and support departments. Sunita Biharie, Apeldoorn: What are we going to do as SP to make it clear that we argue for equality, that people are not excluded on the basis of their origin or skin color? Ron's response: a very valid question. Ron has gained experience in organizing the cleaners. The cleaners employ people from all backgrounds, but the The cleaners' union was a group of white men. That has now also changed. Ron suggests starting a conversation with everyone: door to door, gaining trust. Perhaps we should talk to each other about other, complementary methods. Sunita responds in a second term and calls for more work to be done, as inequality affects many people. Ron is happy to discuss this with Sunita. Ad Meijer, party chairman of the Staten faction Utrecht: Requests departments to also work with the States factions to step up, also with actions. Ron's response: work together, take an example from the faction in Groningen, for example. Peter den Hartog, Sluis: Indicates that the SP is invisible on a number of issues. What do we think about the large flow of refugees? Peter indicates that he sometimes misses the bigger story, even people outside the party do not always know what the SP thinks about something. Indicates that he largely agrees with Kevin Levie, who has resigned as chairman of the SP Rotterdam. Ron's response : Keep thinking about how things can be better, clearer and sharper. Ron has been in contact with Kevin. We are going to implement the resolution step by step, that is the mission, everything is open to discussion. Hans van Heijningen discusses this subject with the Party Council. The report of the conference will be available within two weeks. documents from the Party Council have been included: 1. the amended resolution and 2. an overview of the adopted motions. These documents are voted on and they are both adopted unanimously. Evaluation of procedures followed at the XXI congress: Hans mentions the most important points from the evaluation The information and planning must be improved. The procedure, including voting and multiple candidates, must be determined and discussed at an earlier stage at the Party Council. The procedure for opposing candidates must be discussed during the Party Council. There must also be a discussion about multi-stage elections. Some departments I believe that the department should draw up rules for choosing the delegation. The accessibility of the location was not optimal, with a narrow access path to the conference hall, too little lunch, too few toilets and a lack of clarity about the toilets for the disabled. Hans gives those present had the opportunity to respond.Paul Grevelt, Cuijk: there were similar amendments, and he suggested that the conference committee cluster these amendments in advance and discuss them together.Jan Raaijmakers, Bernheze: there were many amendments that were at the level of points and commas. Hans promises that this will be looked at more closely, but it is primarily the responsibility of the departments that submit such proposals.Caro Goudriaan, Eindhoven: on two amendments, the vote from the floor seemed like a close call and might have counted. someone else suggests using voting devices. Hans then goes through a large number of proposals and briefly explains when this will be discussed further. An amendment has been adopted for RED to double the budget. That is why it is very important that ROOD will grow and recruit members. How will ROOD become more active and campaign-oriented? Hans announces that the ROOD board will come up with a proposal, we will discuss it in March and then we will then make a decision on the budget. Evaluation Committee Congress (incl. party democracy): Committee nomination at the party council in March. The aim is to complete the evaluation at the party council in June 2016. Committee on improving the provision of information for members and departments: The congress has instructed the party board to improve the provision of information. Based on a discussion in the party board about needs and ideas in this area, the party board will come up with proposals at the party council in June 2016. Membership Recruitment Campaigns Committee: We will put the kick-off of the membership campaign on the agenda at the party council in March 2016. Because it is a permanent campaign, we will evaluate the results of our efforts at the subsequent party councils. Committee On to 250 departments: Evaluate campaign On to 200 departments. Link to this what the departments need (money, support) to achieve a good result. We will discuss this in detail at the party council of June 2016. Advanced Training Committee: As an executive board and as a party board, we must first make a clear assessment of the functioning of our training team and the question of what needs our executives have when it comes to 'training for advanced students'. On this basis, we will discuss this point at the party council of June 2016. Committee Evaluation of Payment Scheme: At the party council in March, the party board will present a proposal for the task description of this committee. At the party council of November 2016, we will finalize the discussion and, if desired, we will make decisions. Committee on the Amendment of the Articles of Association & Regulations: At the March party council, the party board will come up with a proposal that should lead to this process being completed at the party council of November 2016. Adopted motions: Peace Festival Committee: Hans van Heijningen (party secretary); Harry van Bommel (TK member); Tiny Kox (EC member); Ineke Palm (SPark employee); Guido van Leemput (Amsterdam department). Committee is instructed to come up with a proposal for the organization of a first SP peace day. Committee on the War on Syria & Iraq: Hans van Heijningen (party secretary); Harry van Bommel and Sadet Karabulut (TK members); Patrick Zoomermeijer. (Zaanstreek faction leader ‚Äì PB Member) Committee on Implementation of adopted refugee motions: Sharon Gesthuizen (TK member); Dennis de Jong (MEP); Tiny Kox (EC member); Committee on climate change, sustainability and living environment: Eric Smaling. The party board proposes to the Party Council to ask Eric Smaling to come up with a vision document that can be discussed at the party board and - subsequently - the party council in September 2016. Request to Eric to writing the piece, including using the knowledge and experience of our representatives, urban and provincial administrators and other party members with knowledge of this matter. Home Care Committee: Ron Meyer (party chairman); Renske Leijten (party board, TK member); Tjitske Siderius (party board, TK member). Implementation of motion 8. Hans asks those present to respond. Peter den Hartog, Sluis: In the motion on the implementation of the refugee plan, Peter wants to propose setting up a broader committee. Now mainly people's representatives In addition, he advocates starting this quickly. Jos van de Horst, Smallingerland: also involving a local party member in the Bed, Bath and Bread motion. Jos himself is willing to do that. Leo de Kleijn, Rotterdam: advocates to quickly speed up the implementation of the refugee policy motion and expand it to include local people. He is putting himself forward as a candidate for this. Mariella van Wijnen, Boxmeer: ‚Äã‚ÄãCan the proposals be sent along with the invitation of the Party Council next time? Hans answers that the names are still were not known when the Party Council agenda was sent.Jos Swartjes, Beuningen: proposes to include the brochure Guest Labor and Capital from the 1980s in the discussion.Spencer Zeegers, Uden: make use of the expertise within and outside the party. You do not have to expand the committees, but you can speak to several people. Bianca Verweij, Hilversum: makes a suggestion to the refugee committee. What negative consequences can the SP get from this and how do we deal with them? Sunita Biharie, Apeldoorn: would like to add Leo de Klein to the refugee policy committee. Maikel Kat, Zaanstreek: Looks back on the situation in Heesch, SP Bernheze. We could also have supported the SP Bernheze with a large team with the presence of MPs. Hans: takes the polarization extremely seriously. Entering into a conversation with the local residents is in initially up to the department. The autonomy and management of departments is very important. There are different considerations for each situation. Part of the daily management was eager to go to Bernheze yesterday, but after a conversation with the department it seemed better now is to pause for a moment. But the big picture is, we will not allow ourselves to be chased off the street and we will look at how we can manage this issue in the right direction. Combining the flow of refugees and also looking at the residents who have have been hit by this cabinet for years. For the composition of the committees, Hans asks for permission to elaborate on this later and to expand the committees if necessary or to ask party members for advice. Hans is the campaign leader and continues the campaign During the previous Party Council, Harry van Bommel explained our position and the problems in Ukraine. He emphasizes once again that the initiative for the referendum was taken by Citizens' Initiative EU and not by Geenpeil. What are the goals of the campaign? take the wind out of the sails of pro EU politicians. Put the SP on the map. Take the wind out of the sails of the PVV, set the tone with our arguments instead of closing the borders. If we succeed in winning the campaign, we will have a good starting position for further campaigns. We have contacts with people from Ukraine, who are given a platform at the SP. Six regional meetings are taking place for SP executives. Hans invites all departments, even departments that do not yet understand the importance of the campaign. If the Netherlands says no to the referendum, we will take to the streets on Saturday April 9 to recruit members. Anna de Groot, Wormerland: she was present at the meeting in Amsterdam. Responds to an article by Harry van Bommel on the SP website He suggests that all countries that enter into an association agreement have ultimately joined the EU. Ronald van Raak: setting up polling stations costs the municipalities 45 million. This government gives 20 million to the municipalities. In many municipalities there will be fewer polling stations. as an argument ‚Äúno one is going to vote anyway‚Äù. Ronald calls on departments to send him a message if there are fewer polling stations in your municipality, and suggests that you also make an issue of it locally. Leo de Kleijn, Rotterdam: Van Geenstijl and Geenpeil have heard from many Dutch people, few are familiar with the EU Citizens' Initiative. Many people will come to know this referendum as an initiative of the new right. As SP we must think carefully about how we pull the campaign to the left, otherwise it will be counterproductive. Michael Verschuren, Breda: how do we translate this complicated story to our residents? How do we explain this well? Gwildor Sok, Zeist: Geenstijl has already made an inventory of all polling sta0tions, and there are much fewer than in other elections. Harry van Bommel responds to the questions: There are many more association agreements, trade agreements between countries, there is nothing wrong with that. But this agreement goes much further, it looks more like a stabilization and association agreement. In the past, these agreements were all intended as step towards membership of the European Union. It is not only about free trade, but also about the transfer of European legislation. It is being sold as an association agreement, but that is not the issue here. In 2008, NATO decided that Ukraine will one day become a member of NATO. Core argument against this treaty: According to its proponents, the majority of the country is in favor of joining Europe, while the country is divided. This agreement fuels division. As Europe, we will then become responsible for the problems in Ukraine and that is not wise. We can help fight corruption and improve relations with other countries. Neoliberal policies are coming into Ukraine: privatization, transfer of democracy, economic damnation. The European funds can then solve that problem again. There is talk of inflation of more than 40% in Ukraine, deficits of more than 10 billion. Ukraine scores high with corruption. Dutch companies will do business with corrupt companies, and thus our market coming in. President of Ukraine is counting on EU membership in 5 to 6 years. We will have to do everything we can to make it clear that we are not joining a Geenpeil initiative. Our arguments, our face, our logo. The media are going completely defeat this campaign, so we will have to go all out and win this campaign. A large majority of the Netherlands, an estimated 60%, will be against this treaty. There is a majority in the House of Representatives that wants to adhere the results. The floor goes to those present in the second term. Maikel Kat, Zaanstreek asks about the approach of the campaign. Harry's response: there is no campaign yet, no slogan, no brochure. The meetings give the campaign team ideas for the campaign and the arguments. Also: is an association agreement the only way to shape a good neighborly relationship? We can also include the larger Europe story. We are in time to determine the position of the Netherlands. The Netherlands has completed the ratification process not yet completed and wait until after the referendum to complete this process. If no is said, the process will not continue. Association agreement must be approved by all countries, if a Dutch no says no, the agreement will not go ahead. Renske Leijten: we As a party, we should not hesitate to go all the way. We have the right arguments. A no is a slap on the nose of Europe. Geenpeil has pulled this referendum to its side. As an SP, we can also do this if we spend a lot of time on the streets. Roland van Tilborg, Zeeland regional representative: The regional meetings are not easily accessible for the Zeeland departments (Leiden, Eindhoven, Amersfoort). Roland asks whether another meeting can be organised. Harry's response: he promises that there will be an additional meeting near Zeeland or West Brabant will be organized at short notice. Daan Brandenbarg, Groningen: Would like a YES, this is what we are going to do. He still misses the plan for the campaign. Tiny Kox: We should not were fooled by political opponents, the outcome in 2005 was initially thought impossible. Left-wing parties from other countries will support us. In Ukraine it is said again and again; Whatever they say, this is an irreversible step towards accession to the European Union. Tiny is 68% against. Ronald van Raak: Looking back on the campaign in 2005. We must decide to make the campaign in April our campaign. We should not be frightened by right-wing arguments. In addition to polling stations, we should not be guided by Geenpeil's inventory. Leo de Klein, Rotterdam: Makes a plea to go all out for the campaign. A sharp, left-wing campaign. There is a difference between 2005 and 2016. That's called Geert Wilders, and the left is in a damn corner. Harold Bos, Amstelveen: Wonders what the slogan of the campaign will be. Not now. Or will there be another variant. In the invitation and the agenda of the Party Council, the Party Board proposes to appoint two committees. The Party Council supports both proposals. The committees will make use of the expertise of other party members. Program committee: Ronald van Raak (committee chairman), Emile Roemer (party chairman), Eric Smaling, Sadet Karabulut, Arnold Merkies (all TK members), Ben van Gils, Maarten Hijink (TK faction employees), Arda Gerkens (EC member), Paulus Jansen, Arjan Vliegenthart, Peter Verschuren, Mariska ten Heuw (councillors), Johan van der Hout (brabant deputy) and Ron Meyer (party chairman).

166948.0," Harry van Bommel Dennis de Jong On Tuesday, European Council President Tusk and British Prime Minister Cameron presented their joint proposals to reform the EU. If the European Council agrees, this is the package that British Prime Minister Cameron will present to his voters in the referendum on EU membership. After the referendum in which the Danes opted to retain national control in the field of justice, and the Ukraine referendum of April 6 in the Netherlands, there is a good chance that the British will hold their referendum on 'Brexit' in the week of June 23. will keep. The SP sees the negotiations between Brussels and London as an opportunity for an alternative Europe and the proposals as a step in the right direction. Yet there is still a lot of work to be done. The proposals also address the role of national parliaments. SP MP Harry van Bommel: 'The plans make it possible for national parliaments to draw a red card against a European bill if they have a large majority. The Council of Ministers must then stop negotiations on such a bill. However, this does not mean that the original proposal is definitively off the table: the European Parliament can continue with the examination and the Commission can make cosmetic adjustments, after which it is the Council of Ministers' turn again. As SP we want to go further: for us, a red card means that the Commission must withdraw the proposal completely.' The SP is also critical in the socio-economic field. SP MEP Dennis de Jong: 'The proposals do not put an end to Brussels' meddling in our socio-economic policy. On the contrary, Tusk insists on what he calls a deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union for the euro countries. It is good that the proposals recognize that there may be exceptional circumstances under which Member States should be able to suspend the free movement of workers. It is also logical that child benefit for children residing in the country of origin is brought into line with the standard of living there. For the rest, however, we are not in favor of discriminating between the social rights of workers from other Member States and those of our own citizens. In this area, government leaders must also take a closer look at the concessions made to the British, because these must be formulated more carefully than is currently the case.' The SP prefers that the United Kingdom remains in the EU, but thinks it is a good thing that the British are allowed to express their views in a referendum. The Brexit discussion also offers an opportunity for the left in Europe to significantly adjust the current neoliberal course of the EU, for example through a treaty change.

182811.0," ‚Äú The SGP wants a 'variation test' for European proposals and laws. No more uniform sausage, but a varied menu with our own dishes.‚Äù This is what SGP MP Roelof Bisschop says in his contribution to the parliamentary debate on Europe. Bisschop refers to the recently published WRR report 'European variations', which argues that the great diversity of the countries in Europe can and should be taken into account European rules and policy. Sensible advice, says Bisschop: ‚ÄúFor far too long, Europe has aimed for more unity and an 'ever closer union'. Those times are really over, just look around you at what is happening in the Member States. Unfortunately, this has not yet dawned on many European minds in Brussels, or indeed in The Hague. A variation test would therefore be good. If the course is not changed, sooner or later things will go wrong.‚Äù¬†¬†Roelof Bisschop's contribution to the debate about the EU ‚ÄúBuild me a rusty house against a blackbird field[1] full of beautiful myths, against the poppies of Poperinge and the golden molars of Auschwitz, against a view of fog and purity, build me a difficult, painful house.‚Äù[2 ]¬†With these powerful sentences, the former Poet Laureate, Ramsey Nasr, paints the value of European cooperation against the gray backdrop of two horrific world wars.¬†The poet also portrays the contradictions on our continent as: ‚Äúa hole filled with Celts and Cathars, Etruscans, Moors, Magyars, (‚Ä¶) Lapps and Vandals.‚Äù Therefore, according to the poet, ‚Äúbuild a difficult and painful house, (‚Ä¶ )draughty and half-finished, but real‚Äù.¬†Mr President, I wholeheartedly agree with the latter. In previous debates I argued that we should not build extra wings on the EU's structure, while the foundation is sagging and the roof is leaking. Last year, during the debate on the state of the European Union on three fundamental flaws in the EU: the ongoing, creeping transfer of powers; the threatened transfer union; and the political agendas of certain European institutions. I would like to hear how my motion adopted last year on the role of the European Commission is being implemented? [3] Realism Chairman, what strikes me in Nasr's poem is the realism. Unfortunately, I often miss common sense in the EU. Our central question when assessing European proposals, and the government's vision of the EU, is therefore: what is realistic?¬†Points of ConcernBefore answering that question, I would like to mention three important points of concern for my group.¬†Firstly, Brexit should be a serious warning: too far-reaching integration, at the expense of national sovereignty and individuality, can alienate citizens from the EU.¬†Secondly, parliamentary control and influence on the EU must be improved. The Member States must be firmly in charge again. In its recent report 'High dikes, low thresholds', the State Committee on the Parliamentary System made seven valuable recommendations in this area.[4]I look forward to the government's appreciation of these recommendations.¬†Thirdly. Urk, Stellendam and Vlissingen see dark clouds coming from Brussels, Paris and London, such as the threatened ban on the pulse trawl based on unreasonable emotions. Wageningen published the dramatic consequences yesterday. Financially, for nature and for entrepreneurship. Officials leaked advice about an infringement procedure. How is it possible? Who rules here? Emotion or innovation? EU officials or fisheries ministers?¬†State of the EU 2019 President, back to my central question: is the government's vision of the EU realistic as far as we are concerned? Our answer is: yes and no.¬†Yes, 'variation' must be the starting point, and collaboration must be cost-effective.¬†Yes, the EU must serve the interests of its citizens and set priorities.[5]¬†But the government can and must sometimes apply the brakes much harder.¬†European coordination of border control, fine, but no EU border army. This also applies to a European army and the equalization of NATO and the EU.[6]¬†Aim for a modern and sustainable MFF and fair burden sharing, but do not agree to an MFF that grows to perhaps 1,300 billion.[7]By the way: do the salaries of European Commissioners really have to be so high?[8]Questions President, I close ends with two questions for the MP.¬†1.¬†¬†¬† How will we notice that the government attaches great importance to 'European variations'?[9] 2.¬†¬†¬† How does the Netherlands, in an EU context, make concrete efforts to ""keep the United States firmly on board""?¬†¬†¬†[1] https://www.groene.nl/artikelen/de-mythe-van-het-merelveld[2] From a poem 'The House of Europe' by former Poet Laureate Ramsey Nasr, May 17, 2011, https: //literatureplein.nl/detail/nieuws/gedicht-het-huis-van-europa-/2740[3] Motion-Bisschop, Parliamentary Paper 22112, no. 2520, see https://zoek.officielekennismakingen.nl/kst-22112 -2520.html.

182179.0,"Party members, ‚ÄúThe Amen, the faithful and true Witness‚Äù. This is how Christ revealed Himself to John on Patmos. We read that in Revelation 3. God is faithful. He does what He says. His Word always comes true. We live in uncertain and exciting times. Anyone who opens the newspaper must first take a deep breath. What will he see next? What has not already happened in the past year? The air disaster with the MH-17. The advance of Isis in Syria and Iraq The terror of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Time and again men, women and children are killed in a cruel, even beastly way. What a world full of sorrow and suffering! John also had a hard time. Persecuted for his faith, exiled to an island. But Christ laid His right hand upon him. The risen Prince of Life said to Him, ‚ÄúFear not. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. Amen.‚Äù¬†Death and destruction do not have the last word. God is faithful. That is certain! We can be sure of that. Only He has the keys to death and hell! That steadfastness, that fervent faith in the midst of misery, I found in January during my visit to Nigeria. SGP and SDOK were there to encourage persecuted Christians. Even if they are shot at, they do not give up their faith. They continue to confess Christ boldly. They can testify are of God's faithfulness in the greatest need. They are often disappointed in fellow human beings. In the Boko-Haram fighters, but also in other people in their own country who react lukewarm to the inhumanities. They are also disappointed about the lack of political pressure from abroad. Where is the international community? ‚ÄúIn the beginning we just knew where the girls were,‚Äù a father of kidnapped daughters told us. But nothing happened. A stunning lukewarmness. Lukewarm and bland instead of faithful. That is exactly the complaint that John had to write to the church of Laodicea. They were neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm. Comrades, isn't that the task, isn't that the assignment that also rests on our shoulders: To go to war against all lukewarmness and faintness, starting with ourselves. And to seek and find our footing only in God's faithfulness! Lukewarmness abounds in the face of Christian persecution worldwide. The SGP insists on making the fight against this a spearhead of foreign policy. In words and with action. The fight against Boko Haram must be high on the international political agenda. Too much of Europe still looks to the ceiling when this is discussed. But fortunately we also notice political resonance. Both with the newly appointed Minister Koenders and widely in the House of Representatives, and we are grateful for that. We must not look away from strangers either. The heartbreaking scenes of the Mediterranean sea burn on our retinas every day. Asylum seekers who have to fear for their lives always deserve a safe haven in our country. The Netherlands now offers more than average accommodation and support, inside and outside our gates. Foreigners can count on an open heart. But we can also use our common sense. Especially when it comes to people who are here illegally. Those who are not allowed to enter after careful procedures stay, must leave. And anyone who does not leave, should not roam the streets in our municipalities. The central government must then take its responsibility: deport or detain. Shelter is now available for emergencies and harsh circumstances, for families and for everyone who cooperates. return. The fight against jihadist forces worldwide is a fight for freedom and against terror. We support the deployment of Dutch F16s in Iraq to stop the advance of Isis. At the same time, we note with concern that our military strength and endurance are inadequate. Irresponsible cuts have taken their toll. An SGP motion to recalibrate ambitions and increase the budget for the armed forces received the support of a parliamentary majority last autumn. Our message to the cabinet was, is and remains: do not delay now, but quickly come up with a generous reinforcement of the defense budget. A matter of loyalty also to alliance agreements in the NATO context. An agreement is an agreement. With tens of millions, the cabinet cannot more will suffice. In fact, billions should be added to fulfill the tasks that Defense has. It would be a good thing if, spread over the coming years, an extra billion euros would go to our armed forces. Jihadist terrorism is and remains a major threat to our security. We are opposing this internationally. But we must also be vigilant nationally to ensure that it does not take root. The freedoms towards the government that we cherish should not provide a safe haven for jihadists. Groups that pose a threat to our The rule of law must be able to be tackled. If Muslims call for the throats of people who want to become Christians to be cut, then that is simply not appropriate in our country. Nor is justifying or putting such expressions into perspective. We will continue to advocate for this. And yes, then we know that opposing forces will try to denigrate the SGP. And hit us over the ears with powerful passages from article 36 of the Dutch Confession of Faith. Let us shrug our shoulders. They just go ahead! In the almost 100 years With the existence of the SGP, we have proven our loyalty to the democratic legal order enough! And if it leads to the Dutch confession of faith being read from A to Z by those who think differently, then that can only be welcomed. Safety is a core task of the government. Those who shape this at home and abroad deserve our support. Police officers involved in shooting incidents should not be brought to court as criminals. The chief of police of the national police said this: It is It is wrong that the law makes no distinction between an officer who uses force for safety reasons and the violent behavior of criminals. As far as we are concerned, a bull's eye! Of course, there must be standards and critical supervision of any use of force. But when police officers act In accordance with the usual instructions for violence, they must be protected from criminal prosecution or the threat thereof. We therefore advocate amendment of the law. Anti-Semitism ‚ÄúLoyal to my fatherland, I will remain until death,‚Äù we sing in the Wilhelmus. On May 4 we commemorate the fallen, we reflect on the horrors of the Holocaust. It is essential to face, not deny or ignore, the horrors of the past ‚Äì whether it is the Armenian Genocide of 1915 or the destruction of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. In today's Europe a monster is rearing its head again: anti-Semitism, which we must keep a close eye on and combat everywhere. If the Netherlands soon takes over the presidency of the European Union, we can still more work on this. An SGP motion to that effect recently received a parliamentary majority. The Netherlands should not stand passively on the sidelines when the state of Israel is threatened by Iran, Hamas and other radical forces. Lukewarmness and dangerous naivety in the face of the nuclear threat of Iran is at odds with loyalty to Israel! Voter loyalty Fellow party members, on the previous party day we looked back on well-run municipal elections. Today we are pleased that so many voters were once again loyal to us in the recent elections, or knew us for the first time The rising trend for the SGP continues! We are very grateful to both our loyal and our new voters. The combined list with the Christian Union for the European Parliament proved its worth. The result is that Bas Belder can take his place from our party We can expect two SGP seats with this result in the elections for the Provincial Council. The water board elections also went positively for our party. In the elections for the Senate in May D.V. we can expect two SGP seats with this result. We say goodbye to Senator Holdijk and are grateful to him for his years of loyal dedication and thorough contributions. Holdijk was and is a senator as a senator should be. We can be grateful that he was in that place and it was a privilege with him We hope to welcome Peter Schalk and Diederik van Dijk, both no strangers to The Hague. We have every confidence in a pleasant collaboration, as has always been the case with Holdijk. Looking back at the great election results, it suits us first and foremost and most gratitude to the Lord. Without Him we can do nothing. It is He alone who can incline hearts.¬†It was great to see that the election campaign generated so much enthusiasm and that solidarity became visible. While we can count on support from veterans, young people are also attracted by the message of the SGP. Both old and new voters attach importance to the two sides of the same SGP coin. On the one hand: faithfully standing up for Biblical values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms, literally and figuratively with the Bible open! On the other hand: making a constructive and meaningful contribution to government through practical political craftsmanship. Faithfulness in Word and Deed! We see this reflected in our people in the municipal councils, in the provincial councils, in the States General, in the European Parliament. Let us continue in that familiar path. Today's political situation offers more possibilities than before. A cabinet of 2 or 3 parties that can rely on a like-minded majority in both Chambers of the States General? No, that is a thing of the past. In recent years, this has given us unexpected and unsought new opportunities and new responsibilities. It is good for us to always notice that our choices are understood and shared, that we have been given confidence. We want to be economical with this. We have never promised cows with golden horns. We cannot break iron with our hands. But we have always diligently looked for ways to adjust the mammoth tanker of government policy: to slow down what is wrong, to promote what is good. And we have achieved the necessary results. Such as more money for security and defense. More money for the family wallet. A more careful transfer of care tasks to the municipality. And support for exit programs for prostitutes. We also have can contribute to Siriz continuing to do her valuable work for women and girls who are unintentionally pregnant. Through our involvement, we have been able to arrange many other matters better in collaboration with other constructive parties. Such as the anchoring of Christian care in various healthcare laws. The scheme for conscientious objectors has been improved and there is an extra impetus for research into rising suicides in our country and how they can be prevented. And it may be said: we have not had to engage in any less polite bartering. We have no law or measure whatsoever. supported what we were against in principle! The composition of the new Senate changes political relations. A new episode has begun. Making budget agreements in the old way is no longer possible. The distance to the cabinet is therefore increasing. However this will go, Our commitment remains the same: remain true to our principles, assess the Cabinet's actions, and support or adjust where possible. We expect the Cabinet to honor old agreements. I already mentioned a generous implementation of the Defense motion. A promise what still stands is the improvement of the position of single-income families. They pay an unfair amount of taxes. In more than one report, the alarm has now been sounded about their financial position. They now really deserve a plus. The tax system that the cabinet is working on must ensure fairer and simpler taxes. But it must also contribute to ensuring that caring for each other is not punished, but rather rewarded. Now that the economy is improving, it is also time for tax reductions. In times of crisis, a lot is asked of citizens and companies. It is now time to reduce the burden where possible. Lower labor taxes also help in the fight against high unemployment. Here and there there are concerns about the governability of our country. Will it be possible in the future to find sufficient parties that are willing to to bear its administrative responsibility? Dear fellow party members: there is no reason to be over-concerned, let alone to panic football. It is completely misplaced to prevent the suffering that one fears with crude artifices such as electoral thresholds or the amputation of the Senate. Please note: the real problem is not that large parties are getting smaller and small parties are getting bigger. On the contrary: there is nothing wrong with that. Stable cooperation can also be achieved with more parties in sub-areas. This has been proven in the past period. And yes, there were also problems , struggles and impasses. But you know what? If they emerged, it was always with and between the major parties! Collaborating with political opposites shows administrative responsibility. In practice, it can hinder the recognisability of parties. We have to pay attention to that. Yes, we we reach out to others, but in the meantime we continue to listen to our own hearts. That must continue to beat. You invest in the trust of the voter by being visible, recognizable and reliable. Our citizens must know what we stand for. We must keep our promises Our actions must match our words. This is how the SGP wants to conduct politics: visible, recognizable and reliable. Let us continue to set the bar high! We echo Prinsterer's Groen: our strength lies in our isolation. That does not mean: Lock yourself in your own right. But: know what we stand for. Mental independence, Groen called it. This is how it is allowed and this is how it can be done, taking co-responsibility. Recognizable and credible. Shortly before the State elections we announced a new campaign: a plea for fidelity. It is truly staggering and shocking how normal adultery is considered. Or rather: how it is made into something normal. It is openly advertised on billboards along the road. Anyone who stands up for marital fidelity must take into account cynical and pitiful reactions. But there is also support. People from inside and outside the SGP are speaking to us. Is this all possible now? Isn't it time for a different voice? Yes, certainly, and that is why we are taking up the gauntlet! It would be great when billboards with a call for loyalty are visible throughout the country later this year. I count on your support for this campaign! But more is needed. A government that encourages and values ‚Äã‚Äãloyalty for each other. A government that promotes relationship therapy and recovery therapy more easily available and better reimbursed. A government that not only preaches freedom, but also responsibility. That is no easy task. A revival of biblical values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms. A government policy that encourages sharing instead of greed. A course that values ‚Äã‚Äãcare for each other. instead of maximum self-development. A protection of vulnerable lives from the very beginning to the last breath. I am talking about abortion and euthanasia, but also very explicitly about the treatment of children and adults with Down syndrome. It is downright horrifying when society is increasingly moving towards the idea that only what is called 'perfect' still counts. It is high time for a strong counter-narrative. With all the concern about developments in society, let us never forget to take matters into our own bosom That is why I conclude with the words of my esteemed predecessor Van der Vlies from the party speech of 1998. ‚ÄúGod's faithfulness shines in the face of and despite our unfaithfulness. When we look at our unfaithfulness, how ashamed we have to bow our heads. Who are we? and who should we be? Then the confession is appropriate: we have done the utmost wrong to God, we have strayed from the path of salvation. (But) we do not have to end up in a minor key. After all, in the face of all unfaithfulness on our part, also be pointed out to God's faithfulness. This has been most gloriously demonstrated in the finished Guarantor Work of God's Son, Jesus Christ, whose blood cleanses from all sin. 'We may encourage one another to seek and get to know Him, Who is the Way, is the Truth and the Life.‚Äù",no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text attacks government incompetence rather than alleging institutional bias toward a specific group.

183271.0," 'I used to be a really annoying little boy' His opponents are left with red spots on their necks, but they too cannot ignore it: Geert Wilders has been playing a decisive role in politics in The Hague for a year. An interview about what Henk and Ingrid notice about this, the bullying of Job Cohen, his collision with Mark Rutte and whether he used to be a bully at school.¬†   Text: Joop Reichart As the company poodle of Panorama, my first question is: one year of the Rutte cabinet with tolerable support from the PVV. Have Henk and Ingrid become wiser from this? ‚ÄúYes, I think so. They see a different wind blowing through the Netherlands when it comes to stricter penalties and tough measures regarding immigration and asylum. Moreover, the government is going to cut its own fat. Less bureaucracy. That would have happened less otherwise. And what was the alternative? That Job Cohen and his associates had come to power. ‚ÄúAre there really fewer immigrants and asylum seekers coming to the Netherlands?‚Äù We have made agreements about that, so that will have to happen. You see in the confrontations I sometimes have with Minister Leers that if things threaten to go the other way, I sound the alarm. But it will take a year, I have to be honest, before you see that in the figures."" Your opponents always say: it won't work, because Europe continues to be obstructive. ""That people are less likely to have family come over, that they have to pay for their integration exam themselves and if they do not pass it, they will lose their residence permit, which has already been decided by the Council of Ministers. But for the most important measures, raising the age from 21 to 24 for partners who are brought to the Netherlands, for example, yes you need Europe for that. I have to be honest, these are measures that yield big hits in terms of figures. And that doesn't look good in advance."" That must be annoying for you, that Europe determines who can and cannot enter here. ""That is unbearable. Europe interferes in everything. Even what it has nothing to do with. That is one of the flaws. But suppose that all the measures we want do not work, then we may have to consider an exception position for the Netherlands in this entire immigration file. Just like Denmark has. Because it cannot be the case that Europe not only determines who is allowed to enter here, but also stops the agreements we have made here in this country?‚Äù You will drive poor Leers crazy from time to time. Right? ‚ÄúI hope not. But I have been hired as a political wolf to stand up for the PVV voters. Suppose I were to cycle away from those 18 billion cuts, the price we pay for the tolerance agreement. Then the CDA would also take the mantle out of me. So when Leers says that reducing immigration is not an objective, then I have to say something about it. Not to bully him, but to stand up for Henk and Ingrid."" Isn't the great thing about this cabinet for you that Job is not in it? ""That is extremely important. If you look at the whole story of immigration and asylum, at the cuts to all those left-wing hobbies, at stricter punishments; that would never have happened with the PvdA. Then the Netherlands would have been much worse off.‚Äù Yet I only heard the PvdA say: immigration came from the right. ‚ÄúNonsense. It is true that CDA and VVD also brought guest workers to the Netherlands and that large companies were behind this. I don't deny that. But the large numbers came in afterwards with family migration. That continues to this day. The left submits an amendment almost every week to make things even smoother and they oppose all the measures we agreed on in the tolerance agreement. And take such a general pardon, in which tens of thousands of people have been legalized, including criminals, even though they have gone through all the judicial authorities and have always been told no. We didn't do that. That's what the left has done.‚Äù I think you really hate Job. ‚ÄúI don't hate Job at all in a personal sense. He is a very neat, erudite man. By the way, I don't hate anyone in politics. I sincerely mean that. Only politically speaking, the PvdA stands for everything I despise. That is true.‚ÄùYou sometimes play it very much on the person. ‚ÄúHe is the leader of the largest opposition party and it is my job to tackle the PvdA in my role. And I like to pick the attack. I really don't understand why Job supports the cabinet with regard to Europe and gets nothing in return. And then he comes up with a whole administrative story. Mr. Cohen has clearly not yet fully realized that he is no longer mayor of Amsterdam. ‚ÄúYou were harassing him quite a bit during the General Discussions. You had fun, didn't you? ‚ÄúI am a fan of a stimulating and offensive debate. I think something like this should happen much more often. If you look at other parliaments, things are often much tougher. We are one of those polder countries where everything runs very neatly, but let's show people that there is a big difference between the PVV and the PvdA. I just think it's a shame that Job doesn't bite anymore. ""You would prefer a better opponent?"" Of course, I have a political interest in Cohen staying in office for as long as possible. I just don't know whether the party will allow him to do that for much longer.‚Äù You often had laughs during the debate. Never thought about a career as an up comedian before? ‚ÄúHahaha. No, I never wanted to be that. I don't do theater in the House, let me say that first, but I always really enjoyed theater when I was at school. I've done something too. No, not big roles. But yes, I do like acting."" Do you spend the evening before a debate thinking about which jokes you can use to upset someone? ""Like everyone else, I prepare a number of jokes. I think about what I am going to say and know what I am going to do during a debate. But you cannot rehearse comments during interruptions in advance. Then I spontaneously say whatever comes to my mind. ‚ÄúSucking and whining are going well for you. Have you ever been a bully at school? ‚ÄúAbsolutely. That wasn't too bad in primary school, but in secondary school I was a really annoying kid. I have often been sent out of class and I have often not made things easy for my parents. I was quite recalcitrant, yes. Always went my own way.‚ÄùSo daddy Wilders sometimes had to come to school?‚ÄùCertainly. I was certainly not a sweetheart at that time.‚ÄùAnd then that famous collision with Mark Rutte. That 'act normal, man'. Did you regret it later? ‚ÄúNo, not for a second. I don't understand the commotion about that either. ‚ÄúBe normal, man,‚Äù is something that many people say to each other every day. There's no swear word in it. It may not be common, but again: look at other parliaments. Worse things happen there.‚ÄùYou didn't realize that everyone was going to fall all over you?‚ÄúNo. I noticed pretty quickly, given the reactions behind me, that it was unusual. But I was really angry at that moment. I don't think I went too far at all. A little bit of livening up can't hurt, right?"" Do you ever regret the things you say? ""I am also a flesh and blood person. So I sometimes regret things afterwards. That I wasn't always good in the past and that I sometimes made my parents sad. But in politics? I can't remember. ‚ÄúThings like head rag tax? Or Islamic voting cattle? ‚ÄúNo. The head rag tax was about headscarves. It was a proposal and you try to present it in a slightly stimulating way. And it worked. Many people thought it was fantastic. Others hated it. And voting cattle? Oh well, that's been used for decades. Aren't we the only ones in that?‚Äù But still... ‚ÄúWhat I especially mind, also during those General Reflections, is that double standard. What have my colleagues not scolded me, my party and my voters for in the past? Almost every day we are called fascists, racists and extremists. And then the entire House chuckles. We collect a huge amount. And then the entire political elite and a large part of the media fall all over me while I do less than a thousandth of what they do. But lecture us, shame us, if I say corporate bullshit, or 'act normal, man'. I will continue to do it because of that outrage alone.‚ÄùGeert Wilders never has doubts? ‚ÄúOf course I have doubts sometimes. But I don't display that doubt. I don't think it's wise either. And I'm that kind of person: once I make a decision, I go for it.‚Äù Always that politics. Ever have time for something fun? ‚ÄúFar too little. What I really like is sleeping?‚Äù That doesn't sound very exciting either. ‚ÄúNo, but I sleep very little and I really like sleeping. It sounds strange as a hobby, but it is true. I also like to travel. Yes, the security guards always come with us. I have a photo of me and my wife in Cyprus and you see me with sixteen people around me. Eight security guards from the Netherlands and about eight local police officers. I don't think about that anymore, otherwise you'll never go on holiday again. For me, going to a supermarket abroad is also an outing. Just go shopping. It's possible here, but it will be such a circus, so I won't start that anymore. I often go to the cinema. That is always a lot of arrangement. Then I enter with security when it is already dark and I leave when the credits roll. But I could relax more, that's true.‚Äù And then you're still working on Fitna 2. ‚ÄúThat's not my first priority. I am currently mainly working on a book about Islam. For the American market. It will be released in April next year in New York. That will not go unnoticed. I think that is very important. It will be a very solid and thorough book. ""What does it say that we don't already know about you?"" It will be a very good analysis of the dangers of Islam and how we can reverse that. Not everyone will be happy with it, I think. It will be a very tender book, in which Islam is taken seriously. ""But what is the new thing?"" I argue and document even more that Islam is a dangerous ideology. That Mohammed really was one of the great bad people who walked around. And that there are lines going back to this time. With what is happening in the world now.""There are a lot of moderate Muslims, right?""Of course. The majority of Muslims are moderate. I also always make a distinction between people and ideology. The moderate Muslim, well, you may wonder whether a moderate Muslim is still a Muslim according to the Koran, because if you don't strictly live by it, you actually aren't one anymore. But hey, as long as people call themselves moderate Muslims, that's fine. And yes, they certainly exist. But a moderate Islam certainly does not exist. I'm trying to make that clear. And you know: there are one and a half billion Muslims and if only one percent is not moderate, there are still a lot of them."" What is your greatest fear? ""That if we do not stop Islamization, it will slowly but surely creep into our society, it will be at the expense of our freedom. Then, little by little, things go in the wrong direction. I would like to warn about that. Otherwise our children and grandchildren will no longer have that freedom.‚Äù And when people say: come on Geert, it's not that bad, is it? Just act normal man! What do you say then? ‚ÄúThen I say: I'm acting normal. It's much worse than you think.

170752.0," Debate about the Brussels attacks Input from Sybrand Buma The barbaric attacks in Brussels have once again caused a shock wave in Europe. Once again people are plunged into mourning because they have lost loved ones. Another city is in shock. A country in mourning. The Netherlands sympathizes with the Belgian population. Our Western society has been touched in the heart. Our Western way of life is being targeted. Our Judeo-Christian values, which are inextricably linked to this part of the world, but which have universal validity, are not accepted by the jihadists. They strike everywhere. Devastating attacks have been carried out in Baghdad and Lahore since Tuesday. Only if we take a determined stand against terror and radicalism can we fight evil. Then the power of our values ‚Äã‚Äãand our tradition will prevail. There is a lot at stake. The population must therefore be able to assume that our society is effectively defended. In these modern times, that starts with international cooperation. And it is precisely that, we must conclude, that is completely lacking. Today we received the answers to the questions asked on Friday. The international fight against terrorism is cringeworthy and amateurish. Every country just does something. There were bits of information everywhere about Ibrahim El Bakraoui, the perpetrator of the Brussels attacks. But no one thought of sharing the information. Turkish President Erdogan put our country to shame by saying that he had been deported to the Netherlands by Turkey. The Netherlands says it knew nothing, Belgium that there was no reason for action. And today we learn that a week before the attacks, the FBI reported to the Dutch police about the background of El Bakraoui and his brother. But why? Was that at the request of the Netherlands, or on the US's own initiative? It now appears that of the 39 deportations from Turkey in 2015, 33 were related to terrorism. All alarm bells should have been ringing long ago. But apparently it never occurred to the minister to make firm agreements on how to deal with these deportations. Mr President, The Prime Minister has spoken about the attacks on several occasions. There is a phrase that keeps recurring, and which raises eyebrows among many people. That is the remarkable statement: ‚ÄúThere are more of us‚Äù. In fact it is true, fortunately there are more non-terrorists than there are. But does it provide any sense of security if those few are able to sow death and destruction so persistently? What should the police officer who defends our freedom with fewer and fewer colleagues do with the 'there are more of us'? What does this buy the public prosecutor, who has to leave more and more cases on the shelf due to a lack of manpower? What benefit does the military police who really have to be in all places at the same time benefit from 'There are more of us'? Defense has only shrunk in recent years and must now act as a stopgap. But the stretch is over. What should the AIVD employee think when this cabinet immediately cut off the entire foreign branch of the intelligence services upon taking office? And what should the GGD officer think, who also faces major capacity issues in the event of major disasters? There are more of us, says the Prime Minister, but the services that are supposed to protect us are fewer and fewer. We now know that the police are short of 300 million euros to maintain their strength at all. And the defense (marechaussee) also has a dire lack of resources. This, added to the lack of international cooperation, creates a disturbing picture. The Netherlands should have been able to trust that this government had put more effort into safety. Fortunately, Minister Dijsselbloem said last Tuesday, immediately after the attacks, that the money that appears to be needed will be available. I ask the Prime Minister whether he has already discussed this with Minister Dijsselbloem, how much will come and when? Then the powers. The AIVD has been waiting for more than two years now for the authority to tap the cable. Minister Plasterk walks from back room to back room, but there is still no bill. The abolition of Sunday rest is a higher priority for this minister than the fight against terrorism. That is not possible. I ask the Prime Minister to ensure that the bill that has been ready for a long time is submitted this week. Almost two months ago, the Minister of Security and Justice promised to investigate how returning jihadists can be monitored even more closely after their return to the Netherlands. He let it slide. The CDA wants an answer from the Prime Minister today: do we arrest all returnees, or do they continue to walk around freely? Potential travelers are also treated as holidaymakers. In November 2012, a man from Doesburg was arrested for planning to travel. He said he was on his way to Syria to visit family, and thanks to that story he was released on bail - with an ankle monitor. Immediately he disappeared from the GPS. This week it became clear that he died in Syria. No one knows how many victims he caused there. Mr President, these questions should actually not have been necessary. The urgency should have dawned on the cabinet much earlier. I expect answers from the cabinet today.

164634.0," Healthcare, economy and social security Text: Arjan Vliegenthart In the run-up to the September 12 elections, the Netherlands is inundated with polls. Interesting food for political junkies, also because research shows that news about polls can also influence voters' preferences. But these are still polls, on September 12 each party will start with zero seats. Yet voter research often provides an interesting insight into underlying trends, something that is probably of more value than the question of whether a party gains or loses one seat. For example, research agency TNS Nipo commissioned research into which themes the Dutch voter finds important. An interesting study, because different parties focus on various topics. For example, Geert Wilders wants to turn the elections into a referendum on European integration and D66 has made reforms a central principle. According to TNS Nipo, Dutch citizens are mainly concerned about the economy, healthcare and social security. Topics surrounding European integration are generally considered less important and Islam appears to have been dismissed as a prominent topic in these elections. The importance that voters attach to the economy, healthcare and social security offers additional prospects for the SP. It is precisely on these issues that a majority of the Dutch population agrees with the SP's proposals. In the Spanning of March this year we showed that there is broad support for proposals to tackle the deductible in healthcare, not to relax dismissal law and to maintain the unemployment benefit. Even when it comes to Europe, a majority of the Dutch population agrees with the SP's positions. A majority of Dutch people are in favor of European cooperation, do not want to return to the guilder, but also do not want to transfer further power to Brussels. The SP also has a good track record in all these areas. The SP has worked for years to counteract market forces and put the patient first. This led to the Kant laws that were adopted this year, which put limits on market forces in home care. In the field of social security, the SP has become an important partner of the trade union movement, which fights inside and outside parliament for good protection for workers (young and old), the unemployed and pensioners. And when it comes to Europe, the SP was the driving force behind the 'no' to the European Constitution that wanted to further expand Europe's power and increase the influence of large companies and the free market. That is why SP members can take to the streets with conviction. Maurice de Hond recently polled that one in three Dutch people is considering voting for the SP under certain circumstances. This means that many citizens are sympathetic towards the SP. The challenge in this campaign is to speak to these well-meaning people as much as possible and to ensure that their sympathy is converted into a vote on September 12.",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text does not claim that state institutions are biased toward a specific group.

162623.0," This week it happened again: if Ireland does not accept a loan from Brussels, it will mean the end of the European Union, according to the President of the European Council, Van Rompuy. Nonsense. Even in the bleakest scenario, Ireland's problems could at most cause problems within the group of countries that have adopted the euro. The European Union will certainly not collapse if a number of Member States had to give up the euro. What does collapse is the delicate game of Van Rompuy and his associates: a trap that leads to more and more transfer of powers, so that Brussels will soon no longer determine what our budget will look like, but Brussels. So the end of the dream of a federal Europe. But of course Van Rompuy does not say that. The core of neoliberal thinking is that companies need increasingly larger markets in order to continue to grow. The government can expand a market, for example by transferring government services to the private sector: think of the postal service or electricity. But you can also create large markets through free trade agreements: for example, the European Union is trying to gain free access to European goods and services in as many developing countries as possible. And European integration is also such a project to create a large market: the European internal market is the basis, but a common currency, the euro, with a large degree of uniform economic policy is the crowning achievement of that work. neoliberals. It is typical that a system is now being introduced in which the European Union will punish countries that do not make sufficient cuts. That is what is now going on in the discussion about an 'economic government' of Europe. There are no sanctions for antisocial policies. So: cutbacks, but no pat on the back if a government stimulates the economy through additional investments, as Obama is currently doing in the US. Ireland has long maintained that it will not accept a loan from Brussels. The country was also in good shape, until some of the most important Irish banks got into trouble and the Irish government had to step in with many billions. This created a huge budget deficit. The Irish government wanted to compensate for this through draconian cuts, resulting in young Irish people leaving the country to look for work elsewhere, and the economy shrinking. By accepting a loan from Brussels, the Irish government knows that it will remain stuck in this vicious circle: in the short term the government will have some breathing space, but Brussels will demand even more cuts, which in turn a bad effect on the national economy. Van Rompuy thinks this is all fine. His heart clearly does not lie with the ordinary Irish who are now unemployed and no longer see any prospects for the future in their own country. No, he is only concerned with preserving that large market with a single currency for the big companies. Otherwise the European Union is done for. Not so: in that case the neoliberal project and the trap that only leads to more and more cuts without attention to social services and good employment conditions are over. The Irish will probably accept the loan, under enormous international pressure. But Portugal has already made it known that the euro is not sacred to that country and that in special circumstances leaving the euro zone is not inconceivable for Portugal. I sincerely hope that Member States, such as Greece, Portugal and perhaps Ireland, have the courage to explore the option of introducing their own, weaker euro. I wouldn't be surprised if, despite all the financial instability this could cause in Europe, ordinary people ultimately benefit.

183341.0," VZ,I congratulate the Kunduz coalition on its success. Thanks to them, the Netherlands will soon jump over its own shadow. Unfortunately without a parachute. This is the reality: Brussels rules, Brussels dictates. The Dutch citizen is screaming, the citizen is dying. For seven weeks the PVV fought like a lion in the Catshuis to keep out the chilly thunderstorms. But the Kunduz coalition has opened its doors wide today. Not only the Hedwigepolder awaits the flood. It will rain in every living room in the Netherlands in the coming years. For seven weeks the PVV kept its back straight; FC Kunduz bowed within 24 hours. 1 email from Brussels and they all jump to attention. It's actually quite impressive: putting together a package in 24 hours that hits the citizen so hard. A wonderful agreement: at least if you are a windmill or a subsidy-hungry environmental activist. A worthless agreement: if you are a hardworking taxpayer. Parties bid against each other to sign the Brussels diktat as quickly as possible. Would you like sambal with it, Mr. Barosso? Please, Mr. Blok. On the day that even the chairman of the European Parliament says that the demise of the EU is near, on that day FC Kunduz quickly signs the capitulation to Brussels. There in Brussels they are laughing their heads off. Their food has been bought, they can have lunch for life while we tighten our belts here. Next year, hollow bolle Brussels Gijs will demand an additional 10 billion. The Netherlands is already throwing 7 billion into that bottomless European pit this year. If Brussels has its way, another half billion will soon be added. Does their greed have a limit? Has their hunger ever been satisfied? The PVV rejected the Catshuis package. The package would destroy our economy and dump the burden of the euro crisis on citizens, especially those on state pension. And what does FC Kunduz do? He still makes Henk and Ingrid bleed on the orders of Brussels. FC Kunduz is mainly FC Knudde.Vz, what is included in the package: One billion will be cut in healthcare, everyone will work faster up to the age of 66, the mortgage interest deduction will be abolished, VAT will increase, the severance payment will be slaughtered. People could soon be fired and end up bankrupt at home on the couch. And at FC Kunduz not a cent in pay increases for the police officers and teachers. But more money goes to left-wing hobbies such as solar panels and art. And the four billion development aid will of course be maintained. In short; less in the wallet and more unemployment. The only people flying the flag are the unelected Eurocrats in Brussels and their friends in Greece. Thanks to them, many salaries will not increase next year and thanks to them, refueling will become an even more expensive joke. The PVV also wants to reduce the deficit to 3 percent, but not in 2013 but only in 2015. This way we prevent our economy from being destroyed by cuts. ¬†Our package looks very different from the crutches team of FC Kunduz. It affects the government and not the citizen. We will make cuts of almost 8 billion euros in 2013. The knife in the government and the knife in subsidies, cutting development aid, getting rid of nonsensical green deductions, no longer deploying our army all over the world. What we are increasing: the bank tax.Vz, with that package we even have room for a lower VAT next year: from 19 to 18 percent. A VAT reduction is great for the economy. People are spending more and that is great news for our companies. We are reversing a number of measures from the past. Such as the Working to Capacity Act, the lower childcare allowance, raising the state pension age to 66, the 5 percent rent increase, the painful cutbacks in appropriate education. For our package, for the PVV package, the following applies: too bad if you are a bank, great if you are a hard-working citizen. Well, there is also good news. And the good news is that citizens will soon be able to say it all. Do we really want that, the package that was presented today? That some unelected Eurocrat says: here's a hoop ‚Äì jump through it. Or do we want to become bosses again in our own home, in our own country? The good news is that there are elections in September. The PVV will do everything in its power to ensure that this becomes a referendum on the Euro, the EU, the unelected Eurocrats, the Euro crisis and on Brussels. For the PVV, the aim of these elections is to preserve our national sovereignty. Decide for ourselves about our budget, decide for ourselves about our money, our borders, our country. Especially our future. Who we let in and who we don't. What we flood and what we don't. What we spend money on and what we don't. Vz, it's about our freedom and independence.

174892.0," Or shorter: What the IMO's MEPC teaches us about TTIP. The United Nations excels at abbreviations. In this way they manage to make every meeting invisible to the general public. Consciously or not, so much politics seems to disappear behind a wall of bureaucracy. I was in London last week at the IMO; the International Maritime Organization. Sounds like an old club of bros arranging the latest ship knots, but nothing could be further from the truth. The IMO is an incredibly important political organization that controls all regulations for international shipping. And that's quite something: How many walls should oil tankers have? How is cruise ship safety regulated? What quality requirements must fuel oil meet? And what are large container ships allowed to emit? These are all matters that the IMO regulates. International shipping is a global business International shipping is par excellence a global business. The Netherlands can try to arrange whatever you want, but a ship owner can easily change flag and then it is no longer a Dutch ship. And of course you can refuse a ship in the port of Rotterdam, but what do you do if Antwerp does allow the ship to enter? There goes your so-called sovereignty. Even the European Union cannot regulate this business. The majority of the business takes place on international waters; where European law does not apply. In short; enough for the European Parliament to pay more attention to this IMO. Last week, at the initiative of the European Greens, for the first time in the history of the IMO, a parliamentary delegation visited while the countries were meeting about new international legislation. About new environmental legislation, that is; it was the 68th (!) meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO. The agenda mainly concerned the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping. International shipping, together with aviation, is the only sector that does not have to do anything regarding the climate. (By the way, there is also such a UN organization for aviation: ICAO. They have to come up with legislation next year.) Fascinating experience (x3) It was a fascinating experience, such a MEPC meeting of the IMO. First of all, it continues to struggle as a European Union: the EU is not officially a member of the IMO (since it is not a country). So twenty-eight EU member states have separate voting rights. However, the EU has now just completed legislation on data collection for shipping. So the European Commission coordinates in the background so that the twenty-eight member states promote the EU line during the meeting. This produces beautiful scenes where EU officials sweat while listening to an input from Greece, because they know that Greece had voted against that EU law (but a majority was in favor, so Greek resistance was in vain). If the Greek official deviates too much from the EU position, corrections will be made via text messages. The EU in progress, so to speak. The other fascinating thing is that the most important countries here are the countries with large flags. In other words; countries that have registered many international ships (in effect tax havens for international shipping). So think more about the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands and Liberia. And those countries rarely make their contribution through their ministries; their input is run by New York law firms. So don't be surprised if Liberia's input comes from a white Yankee. But the most fascinating thing is the input from the industry. Any IMO observer may speak during the meeting. At each meeting point there is a large industry contingent at the back of the room that expertly comments on each proposal during the meeting. Very transparent. If you are present. But since the public light is not really exuberant at the moment, you can mainly characterize the IMO as a conservative male stronghold (yes, mainly men) that mainly agrees that international shipping is having a hard time and that additional regulations are not a good idea . Then try to get climate legislation off the ground.Special role for the Marshall IslandsNow there was a special role for the Marshall Islands at this MEPC meeting. Normally not very energetic in their input, but this time represented by the minister himself (Follow that man on Twitter: @MinisterTdB). And then you suddenly see the conflicting interests: the registries on the islands do not want too many rules for their clients, the ship owners; but the government sees the effects of climate change on their islands every day. Fortunately, politics still wins, at least in terms of input. The Marshall Islands came up with a proposal to impose a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions on the sector. Revolutionary in IMO circles. The proposal was therefore not adopted. But the first step towards regulation has been taken. And the presence of a parliamentary delegation has not gone unnoticed. Little by little, this UN body will also gain the democratic control it deserves. Lessons for TTIP And what lessons can we draw from this for the TTIP free trade agreement? The analogy is striking: with TTIP they want to bring the business community to the table in all kinds of ways, preferably even before the legislative process starts. The following arguments are always given: technical discussion, know-how in the business community, coordination, prevention of unnecessary bureaucratic pressure, etc. In fact, as it is arranged at the IMO, down to the open meetings. Of course, politicians have the only right to vote, but the influence is clear. And if you speak to the business community at such an IMO meeting, it is clear that they always defend the IMO as a technical body that discusses technical points and also has to make technical decisions. If the IMO does not reach a decision, it is due to 'politicization of the debate'. But the IMO is not a technical platform. It is a thoroughly political body and the business community knows that. But they also know that their influence will diminish if the IMO's image becomes political. Then you can no longer optimally influence every decision. Distrust TTIP as a technical solution. Distrust any argument from TTIP proponents who defend TTIP or arrangements under TTIP (such as regulatory cooperation) as a purely technical solution in which politics naturally retains primacy. Or come along to an IMO meeting where the business community keeps a firm grip under the guise of technical discussion to ensure that their sector remains one of the least regulated. In any case, I go to these kinds of meetings more often: the public needs to know what lies behind boring UN abbreviations and what laws are passed under a veil of technical implementation. Or unfortunately, which laws have not been adopted so far.

171399.0," How do we relate to Islam and Muslims? Four principles that can sometimes compete for priority.        The leader of the virtually largest party in our country tweets daily how terrible Islam and Muslims are. He threatens to announce a 'big cleaning'. For many people, these are chilling words from a politician who seems to be gaining more and more support. Also chilling is the threat of a jihadist attack here in the Netherlands, such as those that previously took place in Paris and Brussels, among others. Meanwhile, the secretary of the PKN said in Trouw that he saw many similarities between Islam and Christianity and sparked a small intra-church Islam debate (ND January 4). Politically and ecclesially, the question is more than ever how we relate to Muslims and to their Islam. . I got to know Islam extensively in Egypt and had many conversations with Muslims here in the Netherlands. Perhaps my personal findings can help others. I have four.1. The core of Islam is at odds with the heart of the Gospel If you take the gospel seriously, you know that Islam attacks its heart. The heart of the Christian faith has everything to do with Jesus Christ. He is God's Son, who died on the cross out of love for this world and rose again after three days. Islam says precisely about this three times: not true. Jesus is not God's Son, not crucified and not risen from the dead. Everything that gives a Christian hope is denied by Islam. There are certainly ethical and theological similarities between Islam and the Gospel, but they pale into insignificance when Islam and the Gospel answer the crucial question: who is Jesus Christ? ?2. The Muslim is a neighbor; Jesus asks him to loveIf you take the gospel seriously, you cannot possibly hate a Muslim. The Muslim you meet is someone who is created in God's image and for whom God's heart goes out. To the amazement of his fellow countrymen, Jesus sought out Samaritans, ate with them, and set them as an example. The contemporary application of that example is obvious. And in most cases this is not a difficult task, on the contrary. Muslims are just people... And people with whom it is easier to talk about God and faith than is possible with many of my secular compatriots.3. Give each other freedom It is a big misconception that you first have to find someone's views reasonable before you can be tolerant. As if all the dark, unpleasant sides of Islam must first be condoned and only then can we be tolerant. But tolerance is not only intended for what I like and love, but also for what cuts me to the soul. What Islam says about Jesus cuts to my soul. And yet I stand for freedom of religion and belief for everyone - Muslim and Christian, religious and secular. I have seen in Egypt the unjust situations it leads to when a government decides what is truth, which believers are first-class citizens and which citizens have to take a second place. How can you possibly get angry about the treatment of Christians in Islamic countries while simultaneously daydreaming about similar treatment of Muslims here? It is also a misconception that promoting the Christian faith and combating disbelief can be in the hands of the government are laid. Especially if you confess that faith is the work of the Spirit, you should be afraid of a government with a religious agenda. ‚ÄúNot by might, nor by might, but by the Spirit of God shall it be done.‚Äù4. Defend freedomFreedom is not a free pass. Not even for Islam. I have seen how ex-Muslims are treated in the Islamic world. It is so unpalatable that people are not sure of their lives just because they have come to believe in Jesus Christ. The Open Doors ranking speaks volumes: contemporary Islam has a major problem with freedom. Even in the Netherlands, ex-Muslims are sometimes harassed and Ayaan Hirsi Ali is unsure of her life. Unacceptable. We cannot possibly close our eyes to the outrages committed in our time in the name of Islam. And if we love freedom and justice, we must do what we can to protect them by combating jihadism. Here and elsewhere in the world. Preferably with words, but if there is no other option, also with the government's tools of violence. Many Muslims are an ally in that struggle. The vast majority of the victims of jihadism are also Muslim. The mistake Wilders makes is that he also tries as hard as possible to kill those who could best help him - the Aboutalebs of this world - in the fight against jihad. to offend. The freedom that Muslims have been granted and which we ourselves also enjoy, must be fervently defended when that same freedom is threatened in the name of Islam. AbundantThere are four principles that stand side by side and sometimes compete for priority.

160959.0," Under the name GeenPeil, the Geenstijl website is trying to request a referendum on the association agreement concluded last year between the European Union and Ukraine. In order to submit that request to the House of Representatives, the initiators need 300,000 signatures before September 28. Everyone who signs for this will receive the following text: ‚ÄúYou have just made Alexander Pechtold very sad.‚Äù If that's not a typo, it's a fallacy. Opinion piece, D66 Member of Parliament Kees Verhoeven, Parool 09-09-2015 D66 was founded in 1966 to give people more influence on government. That is why we have always campaigned for more democracy in the form of directly elected leaders, such as mayors or the prime minister. Unfortunately, our proposals to this end have been blocked in the past by the old power parties VVD, PvdA and CDA. They always did not dare to give people more influence. Our initiative to give people the opportunity to overturn parliament and reverse a decision made through a corrective advisory referendum is also in line with our efforts to give people more say. As a political emergency brake afterwards, the referendum is an excellent instrument. This does not apply to the you-ask-we-turn referendum that precedes decision-making by the government and parliament. An easy tool for politicians who no longer know what to do or who do not dare to make a clear choice. Such referendums weaken democracy precisely because they actually make the elected representatives redundant. Before the summer, a large majority in the House of Representatives and Senate supported the D66 proposal for the corrective referendum. A nice, democratic step. Regardless of the content behind each referendum request, our Members of Parliament will not sign it for the simple reason that it is an appeal to parliament. So to ourselves. As elected representatives, members of the House of Representatives have different instruments every day to put matters on the agenda. The referendum is an excellent democratic instrument for all Dutch people who are not in parliament. The scoop now goes to GeenPeil, which wants to ask the Dutch population whether, like parliament, they agree by a majority with the association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. D66 is in favor of this treaty because we would rather see Ukraine close to Europe than under Putin's yoke. We believe that good cooperation within the European Union, but also with countries around us, is of great importance for our stability and security and therefore for our prosperity. GeenPeil seems to be against this treaty (""Have you ever been asked what you think of this European expansion?""), although they keep stating that this is not a referendum against the EU but for democracy. The fact that D66 makes a substantively different assessment than GeenPeil is only good for the debate. And of course, we remain as enthusiastic about the referendum instrument itself as ever. If GeenPeil succeeds in gathering the necessary signatures, D66 will look forward to the referendum with interest and confidence. And for us it is self-evident that, provided the legal limit of at least 30% turnout is met, the outcome of a possible referendum must weigh heavily on the government and parliament. If, like the initiators, you want a referendum on the treaty with Ukraine, then please sign it. And know that anyone who uses that democratic right makes Alexander Pechtold happy.

163627.0," Jan Marijnissen In those February days of 1992 we stood at the gate of the government in Maastricht. We stood there ‚Äì almost twenty years ago now ‚Äì to demonstrate against the Maastricht Treaty that was put together there. It was crystal clear to us that this treaty was a gesture to European business, especially multinationals. They didn't like all those borders, they were bad for trade. They made no secret of the fact that they wanted a United States of Europe, with one government, one president, one market and one currency. United in the somewhat secretive society The Round Table of Industrialists, they plotted how to get politicians on their backs. Because of course something had to be overcome. After all, what would be left of democracy in that superstate Europe? How would the people still have a say? Without the latter question being answered, politicians almost without exception adopted the business agenda. The largest monetary operation in history could start. That one market and that one currency were created. But boontje came for his wages. The recklessness of the politicians would be punished by the laws of reality. One currency for one country allows that country to conduct monetary policy, appreciate or devalue its currency. That remedy was taken out of the hands of the Member States. That is what is now killing Greece and Europe ‚Äì among other things. Idealism is nice, but if ideals are not first passed through the sieve of realism, they can turn into their opposite.

183946.0,"Mr President, This budget discussion is of course a good time to reflect on all the damage this government is causing.¬† In the field of asylum & immigration, this damage is truly unprecedented. The borders remain wide open, and the influx of asylum seekers is breaking all records. This year, more asylum seekers have arrived up to and including October than in all of 2014 and 2013 combined. Then of course asylum seeker centers will spring up like mushrooms, and the government has promised to always make money available for this. No matter how many fortune seekers come...According to the EU, many more asylum seekers will come to Europe next year than this year.¬† And because the government does nothing and does not want to do anything, the asylum tsunami will become even worse in the Netherlands than we are experiencing this year! That is unimaginable, now that everyone sees that our country can no longer cope with the ongoing asylum disaster! Mr President, this is of course all a thorn in the side of the PVV. Our country is being given away at a rapid pace. Our culture, prosperity and security are being trashed as if they were nothing. The PVV continues to call for a turn of the tide, and I am now doing so again... Finally close the Dutch borders and no longer allow any asylum seekers in. The need to do that is extremely great. And then I would of course also point out the issue of security! It is precisely in this area that the government, and this State Secretary, has shown a naivete that is unparalleled. It has been repeatedly claimed that it is unlikely that terrorists will hitch a ride with the flow of refugees."" It is now clear that in every case two of the Islamic slaughterers who were running a house in Paris entered Europe in this way! The State Secretary acknowledges that he has completely misjudged this. And can he drop his naivety about terrorists in the flow of refugees as soon as possible... Please respond, because downplaying problems is downright dangerous... The PVV has always warned that terrorists are hitching a ride in the flow of refugees. It is also logical that this happens! Then they don't have to show a passport or papers. Asylum seekers are also allowed in without papers. It couldn't be easier or more anonymous. Not even if you take the plane to Schiphol, for example. Mr President, in this way, without papers, without passports, almost 12,000 asylum seekers have entered our country this year. In the Netherlands alone, that is! So thousands of foreigners are allowed into our country, some of whom this State Secretary has no idea who they are and what they are doing here. Doesn't the State Secretary himself think that is completely irresponsible! Mr President, The State Secretary has completely lost control. This is also evident from the answers to the actual questions that my group has asked. We asked how many asylum seekers in the Netherlands have committed a crime. The answer was 'no idea'. We asked how often the residence permit of foreigners is revoked due to a committed crime. Again, the answer was no idea. We also asked how often false passports or incorrect documents are found with residence applications. The State Secretary does not know this either. We asked how often, on average, asylum seekers bring partners or family members to the Netherlands. There is also no insight into this. We asked how often, on average, rejected asylum seekers submit other residence applications. Also here the answer was 'we don't know'...Mr President, this is not possible. This proves that the government has no idea what it is doing. It doesn't know how big the problems are. How is this possible, is my pressing question. Is it incompetence or powerlessness? Or is the cabinet actually happy that no one knows something about the true nature of mass immigration. What we don't know won't hurt, the government may think... In any case, it shows that rapid action is needed. The most important questions about the most important topics can be answered by State Secretary will no longer say: 'I don't know it all myself either'. Stop muddling through, stop squeezing and keeping things wet and stop the influx of asylum seekers! Madam President, Unfortunately, we are not there yet with the latter, stopping the influx of asylum seekers. many admitted asylum seekers will lead to major follow-up invasions. This of course happens with the well-known snowball effect of partner and family migration. Migrants who receive a residence permit can bring several partners in succession to the Netherlands. Their children can also be brought here. And they in turn will also bring partners to the Netherlands and so on. In this way, mass immigration - even without the influx of asylum seekers - is completely out of control. To understand this, we have to look at how this worked, for example, in the Moroccan community At the end of the guest worker scheme, there were still approximately 27,000 Moroccans in the Netherlands. This relatively small group grew, mainly due to partner and family migration, to the no fewer than 380,000 people that the Moroccan community now has. We are in danger of this snowball effect. now also with the Syrians, the Eritreans and all other groups that the government lets in here as asylum seekers. Mr President, the government cannot allow that nightmare scenario to happen naturally, and that is why I ask the State Secretary what he is doing to prevent partner and family migration. The PVV wants that no persons from Islamic countries be admitted in the context of this regular immigration. Otherwise, the evil Islamization of our country will continue at full speed, while we must of course stop it. It is incomprehensible that the cabinet has not yet has made the smallest start in tackling partner and family migration. Knowing that this will only make the immigration disaster worse. The government does not find it a problem that there is not even a limit on the number of partners that someone can successively leave for country of origin to the Netherlands. A marriage is not even necessary for this. And you certainly don't have to start with education requirements, etc. So in this area too, the cabinet continues to distribute residence permits. Chairman, The lack of decisiveness from the government is of course terrible, but it is really bad if this is justified with strange fairy tales... Unfortunately, this is happening more and more often, and the PVV also wants to use this debate to put an end to that deception... Hopefully the government will work State Secretary contributed to this. Let's start with the fairy tale that asylum seekers go to the Netherlands because of their safety. That is not the case, because they were safe for a long time before they came to our country. E.g. in Turkey and/or in all the European countries they visited before they got here. What the fortune seekers care about is the money, the welfare state and the rental houses that this cabinet has given them in their laps... Can the State Secretary just acknowledge this! President Then the fairy tale of the highly educated Syrians who would come here. The director of the COA recently claimed that no less than 2/3 of Syrians are highly educated. But the reality is that 2/3 of the Syrians are highly educated. Syrians are on social assistance. And in Germany it has been established that the vast majority of Syrians should be considered illiterate. In that light, it would be very coincidental if our country, on the other hand, gets all the nano-technologists and heart surgeons. And without hard evidence of this on the part of the cabinet, this should not be claimed. Not even from the services for which the State Secretary is responsible. I would like a clear response to this. In line with this, Chairman, I also ask the State Secretary to distance himself from the myth that immigration is good for the economy. Please admit that this is not the case and that immigration actually costs us a lot of money. This has been proven many times, including by the Central Planning Bureau, by Nyfer's research, by the Scientific Council for government policy and so on. It helps if the cabinet is also honest about this. And also admit that immigration can never be a solution for an aging population! Another persistent myth. The Dutch Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute already stated this years ago. made into scientific mincemeat. But if this nonsense is spread into the world from the EU, for example, it will never be combated by the cabinet. This is how the lies win and that must stop. Finally, Chairman, I would like to note that the faction of the PVV will vote against the budget for Security and Justice. In addition to what my colleague Helder said about this, I can explain this with the fact that the enormous costs of asylum reception are unacceptable, because asylum seekers should not be placed in the Netherlands, but in their own region. captured..",no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text does not irrationally claim that state institutions favor any specific group.

165364.0," Today the Netherlands celebrates freedom. That is important, but it strikes me that freedom is interpreted very limitedly. No violence, no oppression, those are the key words. But are we really free when we look at the economy? How democratic is it actually? Banks that we must help, even if they have speculated irresponsibly for years. Small entrepreneurs who are outcompeted by multinationals. Employees who have little say in the company, even though they have been working there for years. And tenants who have to deal with commercial housing associations. Is that freedom? Fortunately, the discussion about democratization of the economy is in full swing in the SP, because without democratization there is no real freedom. Let's think about that today. It's a beautiful day for it. Freedom is more than a country without war. Freedom also means feeling safe, not having to run into rules everywhere and, first and foremost, having the feeling of having control over your environment. On all these points, freedom has decreased rather than increased over the past 68 years. There are almost twice as many people in the Netherlands as in 1945 and that requires more organization and regulations to keep it all livable. Those rules do make us less free. I still remember that in the Netherlands you could go by car on quiet roads and go wherever you wanted. That is no longer possible. In fact, it is not recommended for environmental reasons. The same applies to what you can and cannot do on the street, where you can smoke, where you can 'hang out', where you can sleep on a couch. There are good reasons for these kinds of rules. There is no other way, but it does limit your freedom. In addition, our economy has changed drastically. We have gone from a country with many small businesses, small schools, hospitals and village councils to a country of large scale. What do you really have anything to say about? Isn't it just the banks and big companies that determine what we are allowed to do? How much should the government cut? And what should happen next with social rights and facilities? Rules to ensure that our society runs smoothly, even with double the number of inhabitants compared to 1945, are inevitable. Too bad you have to, but you can't live without it. We can tackle large-scale connections that determine our lives in an often undemocratic way. The economy is not an uninfluenceable entity. Just as globalization and European integration are not. We have a choice: do we allow large-scale connections to determine what is good for us, or do we regain our freedom and support small-scale? In politics, that is the essential choice for now: do we agree to a world over which we have no control and where free trade and a free market have become inviolable principles? Or do we regain our say in the knowledge that the economy is there for us and not the other way around. I emphatically choose the latter. That is democratization of the economy and that is ultimately freedom.

182886.0,"He is the most discussed Dutchman in recent years. The politician who has been waltzing through the room with his PVV since 2006 and criticizing The Hague 'desperately' wants to become Prime Minister. Geert Wilders (47) about Mein Kampf, head rag tax, power and Peter R. de Vries. By Norbert Pek Do you hate Islam? ""I hate everything that has to do with Islam. But not Muslims."" But do you hate this religion? I choose the word because it reflects in you process. 'Hate is very emotional, I don't want to use that word. I do have the variant in a cognitive sense. I don't hate anything or anyone, but I have enormous difficulty with the intolerant totalitarian ideology called Islam.'Is hatred in the Netherlands towards Islam by you and the PVV?' Not the hatred. We have managed to make people aware of what Islam stands for. They also see that the cabinet is doing nothing about it. In big things, such as a lawsuit against me, because they want to limit freedom of expression. Or in the so-called small things, as the press calls them. I think they are very big. That you are not allowed to have a Christmas tree in some schools. That you only have halal meat during can eat Christmas dinner. 'It is clear that the people you reach react more emotionally. Just look at the many internet forums. 'I am responsible for my own words and do not sell hatred. I also do not call for violence. Many people do not need Geert Wilders to have an aversion to an ideology that does preach hatred. Because incidents become a structural problem, for example because of what people experience in their street with Moroccan youth. If your daughter is called a whore and your son is beaten up is being beaten, I don't have to indicate that it is wrong. The government must dare to say that cultures are not equal. You are not a racist if you say that our culture is better than the backward Islamic culture. Then you are telling the truth. 'According to the report Polarization and radicalization in the Netherlands, you are a new right-wing radical. What influence will that have on your 'process of the century'?' The report is a one-two punch between left and left. It is written by left-wing quasi-researchers who have a political agenda , on behalf of a PvdA minister. Only in North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and similar countries does the government control political parties. This is not good politically and not in terms of timing either. Right now we are being pushed into a radical corner with a so-called scientific sauce. Who now still thinks it is not a political process, must buy new eyes. The PVV is detested from the extreme right because of our pro-Israel positions. They often call me the Zionist of the House of Representatives. 'Peter R. de Vries calls you dangerous, a demagogue with the potential of a despot and evil. 'I don't take Peter R. de Vries seriously. I think he sells a lot of nonsense. Maybe it still hurts him that he has not succeeded in politics. Maybe he is jealous ""Maybe he needed publicity. I don't know. It's too much honor for him to take it seriously. But he has freedom of speech, even if he talks nonsense."" It's painful for you that it is precisely he who makes this comment. In a poll six months ago, he was more popular among PVV voters than you. That is undoubtedly true, but these statements have not done him any good in the following polls. Since his statements, the PVV has risen in the polls. Anyway, who is Peter R. de Vries? To me he is an insignificant person. I read his comments, think something about it and quickly get back to work. That's why people chose me. Not because of Peter R. de Vries to comment, but to combat Balkenende and associates. 'How do you build a good love relationship with an immigrant? 'What kind of question is that? Not to talk about your personal relationship, but in your party you and some fellow MPs have a relationship with an immigrant woman. Can you, as an experienced party, explain how you build such a relationship?' When I answer, it quickly becomes about me. It's a legitimate question, but for many reasons such as safety, I don't discuss things that have to do with my wife. I have almost always succeeded and I will continue to do so ""Again, it's not about your privacy that matters to me."" Then you have to ask the people themselves. I can't explain how others build a loving relationship if I don't want to talk about myself. Still, it's a remarkable contrast. Your party has a xenophobic image among many, but some PVV members are in a relationship with an immigrant woman. 'We have nothing against immigrants, although that is often claimed, we have something against Islam. Our immigration stop applies to people from Muslim countries. Except when it comes to asylum. We also voted in favor of motions in the House that persecuted gays from Iran or Syria could be given a place here as asylum seekers. 'Which parties do you not want to govern with?' In principle, we do not exclude anyone. I have I have sometimes said that I find GroenLinks quite unthinkable, because they said that Dutch culture does not exist. It is obvious that after the elections we will look at parties that have not excluded us: VVD, CDA and Mrs Verdonk. The Christian Union leaves it in the center and I have not heard anything from the SGP. 'You do not rule out D66, while Alexander Pechtold considers you to be the extreme right. It is quite unlikely that you will govern next to him. 'You do not have to be called Einstein or have been a political analyst for twenty years. to calculate how likely it is that the PVV will be in the cabinet with D66. I consider that possibility to be extremely small, if not negligible. But I am not in favor of ruling it out. 'Do you want to become Prime Minister?' If we Being the largest party provides you with the Prime Minister in this country. Although as the largest party in the Netherlands you can be sidelined. I would love to do it. Because I can change something, not because I necessarily want to be in the tower.' On June 1, 2008, in a speech in Denmark, you listed six demands: an immigration ban from Muslim countries, voluntary repatriation to the homeland of Muslims, a halt to the construction of mosques, a ban on the Koran, closure of Islamic schools and correct history education. Which can the Wilders government guarantee? ""That depends on who we are going to govern with. We will have to negotiate, make some concessions here and there. We certainly want to make concessions. I am not going to say now which points are important and which are not."" So you say: everything is negotiable. 'It's about the end result. If nothing is negotiable, you might as well stay away from the coalition negotiations. I think our voters would like to see something change in the Netherlands. They understand that we have to make compromises, but I wouldn't be worth a wink if government is not a means, but an end."" That is painful. You have been tough and clear in your positions in recent years and yet you cannot guarantee anything. ""If I don't take my responsibility , I have to say to the voter: the PVV will always remain in opposition. Then we don't have to negotiate with anyone. But we are not an SP that always shouts from the side and ultimately never wants to participate. If we get our way on important points , we want to govern. In fact, we are prepared to give tolerable support to a minority cabinet according to the Danish model. It is not about the plush for us. I am not interested in having all PVV ministers. It must serve a purpose, namely influence to to change the policy. If we have to compromise too much, we say: just look at it. Then we will come down hard on the opposition. 'Why is Frits Bolkestein a political hero?' He was. Not a bad word about Bolkestein , but since he fell in love with Europe, things have become less so. He was a great person when I started working for him in the early 1990s. Someone who dared to say what many people thought and criticized the multicultural society with conviction and arguments. I learned from him that you have to be able to take a beating. Unfortunately, he passed the baton to Hans Dijkstal. I can still sleep about it. A very nice man, but politically completely unsuitable to succeed Bolkestein. 'That's right. the progressive Bolkestein called your head rag tax a bawdy proposal, you must be terribly stung. 'He will find it. I take it for granted, but I don't care what people say about it. Bolkestein is a party man. He will always support the VVD and approach everything else negatively. He has more terrible things to say about it. told me and he can. Some VVD members say worse things about me. Others, like Wiegel, say kind things. That is the VVD's game. ""Do you regret the proposal?"" No. In fact: in France they are now going to introduce something very similar. The bill has almost been adopted, I think it is in the second phase. Wearers of a burqa and the niqab can count on a fine.' The undercover report by HP/De Tijd showed that some PVV colleagues were not happy with the head rag tax and stated that afterwards neither were you. 'There was more in HP/De Tijd that I did not recognize. Which was simply not correct. This is an example of that.' simply denies it. 'Yes. We have convincingly presented the proposal. I don't know what French means for a head rag tax, but the principle is now being applied in this European country. That proves that the head rag tax was really not such a crazy proposal. ""Should Mein Kampf remain banned?"" If you ban Mein Kampf, you must remain consistent and also ban the Quran. So my answer is: yes. Because the book calls for and incites violence. At the time Mein Kampf was banned, I I have not heard of a single left-wing politician who shouted shame on his hind legs and requested an emergency debate. Yet with the same article of law in hand, you must also ban the Quran. When I suggested that, the world was too small. I was the one who made the abject shouted things. Any form of consistency was gone. 'You are also inconsistent yourself. On the one hand you are for freedom of expression, on the other hand you want to ban two books.' There is a limit: incitement to violence ""Banning books is something you should do very exceptionally. It is not in my nature."" But you are not for total freedom of expression. ""I am. But even in America, a country that goes further, First Amendment restrictions apply in the sense of incitement to violence. If you say I have a big belly or am an asshole, I will never report you. If you say that tomorrow everyone has to kill Wilders, it's something else. 'I have a religious text in which violence is the solution.' And he went after the Israelite man in the whore shop, and stabbed them both, the Israelite man and the woman through their bellies. Then the plague ceased from the children of Israel. 'If you are consistent, the Bible in which this is written should also be banned.' This is the Old Testament. It is not an incitement to violence. That is the difference with the Quran. The Old Testament tells in a narrative manner how everything should be done. The Quran has a different context. Everything is made imperative there: 'cut off their heads and necks'. The Old Testament is also followed by a milder New Testament That did not happen with the Koran. When Mohammed was in Medina, he was an aggressive warlord, a dangerous madman and a mass murderer. 'Yet you know that people are Bible-based. They also take texts literally. In the text I read, violence is a justified choice.' Yet it is not as stated in the Koran, whatever you think of it. It says: 'Take them, tie them up, kill them.' That is compelling. But look especially at the practice today. Certainly not all Muslims are terrorists, but just about all terrorists are Muslims. In most dictatorial regimes in the world, Islam is dominant. These are not Christian countries where you are hanged as a homosexual, you are hanged as a journalist or you are shot as a woman; These are largely Islamic countries. In the Netherlands we have no problems with Buddhists beating up gays. Because that's what Moroccan youth do. 'Why were you a VVD member in 2003 before the invasion of Iraq?' Because Saddam Hussein represented a terrible regime and with the knowledge of when the rules were ignored. We only now know through the Davids committee that the government did not pass on all the AIVD information it had. We as MPs did not know that. I have no regrets about it to this day that we supported the raid at the time. I am not going to take back a word of that.' In 2010, that is not a popular position. 'It would be cowardice to suddenly be against it now. With the knowledge at the time, it was a decision that supported I really think that despite the terrible things that happen every day, Iraq is now better off than under the clan of Saddam Hussein. In your declaration of independence in 2005 you believed that the generous welfare state should be stripped. You were in favor of abolishing the minimum wage , for relaxation of dismissal law, for a lower tax rate. Now you are often called more left-wing than the SP in the socio-economic field. How do you explain this major change? When I am in the Chamber, Rutte and Kant take turns coming forward Rutte says: 'You do not want to relax dismissal law and protect the welfare state. You are more left than left.' A minute later Kant comes: 'You do not want to deduct mortgage interest, you do not want a 60 percent tax rate, you want child benefit. You are the party of the villas.' They both feel the need to push me into a different corner. As long as that happens there is nothing wrong. 'You are right on two points. We differ on two important points. the Wilderstijd Group. In these times of economic crisis, we do not want any relaxation of dismissal law. We also do not want to increase the state pension age. I do not see that as left-wing. The left does not have a monopoly on social policy. According to Elsevier, the Netherlands has had 200 billion spent on mass immigration. We think it is a shame that you place the price of those left-wing hobbies and that failing financial policy on the elderly in society. 'I think that 95 percent of the declaration of independence still stands after the break with the VVD. In some areas we have adapted to the times. I want to defend those differences with pride and conviction. 'These changes also come from populism. You know your voters well and know what they want. You have also looked at the Danish People's Party, which is popular is with its popular right-wing policy. 'No. Because again, not raising the state pension age has to do with our conviction. Not with the popular right. What a terrible term by the way. 'I think it fits.' I think it's a strange word. Look, we are not Rita Verdonk who says: we put it on the website, you can email what you think and we will follow it up. We have not asked Maurice de Hond or anyone else. We have determined a position and are going to the farmer with it 'Why does PVV only participate in the municipal elections in Almere and The Hague and not even in Venlo and Volendam?' We do not receive large subsidies and we do not have an office with fifty semi-civil servants who do work for us. We also participate in the Provincial Council. Not because we want to be entrenched in those provinces, but a cabinet with the PVV needs a majority in the Senate. Otherwise they would let us stumble on the first day. That is why every PVV MP has adopted a province. Some are going well, others a little less, but we still have a year and a half. Everyone does it in addition to their regular work. Another hundred municipalities are not possible. It is better to have a nice Senate faction than a big party in Venlo and problems three days later. 'Could you? Is it also difficult to find suitable Members of the House of Representatives?' We have a quantity and quality of future House of Representatives candidates that you can make a point of. I sit here every Saturday because we have so many classes with good candidates. Last time, Groep Wilders had just left the VVD, Theo van Gogh had just been murdered and the newspapers were full of warnings. At home on the couch, candidates were told by their wives: don't do it.

184021.0,"Click on the photo to watch a video of the input. Madam President, We are losing our country. For good if we do not wake up very soon. The open borders and the unwillingness to defend the identity of our country have made the Netherlands sick The terrorist threat is greater than ever. The Netherlands is no longer a safe country. We have allowed hundreds of thousands of people into our country without telling them that it is our country. And we are now paying the price for that. But the Netherlands is really ours. Many people, in addition to their Turkish or Moroccan passport, also have a Dutch passport. But some of them do not behave like Dutch people. We can see it every day. They do not respect our country. They have no regard for our values, for our identity. , to who we are. They increasingly behave like rulers, criminals, profiteers, they get the blood from under our nails, they defy authority, dance on police cars, swear at us, look down on us, spit on us and pull don't care about anything. They have our passport but they are not with us. They are not Dutch. And I say to all those people who misbehave: The Netherlands is our country. It is ours. Not yours. And if you if you don't want to behave, if you want to terrorize us, if you want to turn this into a little Turkey or little Morocco, then you won't succeed. Because this is our country. Where we are tolerant, but not against those who destroying a country. Where we have respect for every individual but not for people who use violence and terrorize us. We are the Netherlands and this is our country. And we are going to reconquer it. Starting today. We will no longer allow our women and daughters to That our neighborhoods are being terrorized. Our shops are robbed. That the elderly no longer dare to take a walk in the evening. That eggs and glasses are thrown at us from balconies. That our benefits are abused by guests in big BMWs. That The Netherlands is being destroyed. We will not accept that anymore. Enough is enough. From today we will fight back. Hardly. No more community centers or benefits, no more victim role and no more understanding. As far as I am concerned, we will catch anyone who has two passports and commits a crime. Dutch passport and deport them from our country ‚Äì yes, our country. If possible, with their entire family. And where necessary, if the police can no longer cope, we also deploy our army to make the streets of the Netherlands safe and to chase you out. We are going to win. Not you but us, 100%. And why? Because this country is ours. Madam President, For twelve years now I have been proclaiming in general debates, and in almost every debate, outside this parliament and in fact throughout the world, that the imported problem is called Islam. And that that Islam was brought into our gates through mass immigration. And that Western governments, including ours, have been complicit in this in recent decades, with their abhorrent ideology of open borders. For twelve years I have placed hope and optimism in the face of dismal culture of capitulation of those in power. Who do not want to listen. Or during election time suddenly promise mountains of gold, but after the elections they start governing with their archenemies and cause new misery, terror and asylum records. Who always choose their own power instead of for the Netherlands. Drunken with their own right, convinced of their own superiority. Those who criticize and dare to name Islamization as a problem are called the extreme right, or idiots, populists or Nazis. The critics are threatened, denounced and, if possible, also for brought to the judge. I am also the chairman. The day after tomorrow, on Friday, when the rest of the colleagues are in their beds after enjoying this debate, I will be back in court. Half of Europe is on fire, our Prime Minister calls Pleur On to the Turks European government leaders such as Slovak Prime Minister Fico simply say that they do not want more Muslims in their country, anything is allowed. But on Friday I have to answer to the criminal court again for something that millions of people think and believe. While the terrorist threat in the Netherlands has never has been as high as it is now, while almost 80% of Dutch Syria visitors are Moroccan, an elected representative is being prosecuted because of statements about Moroccans. Big words here about freedom of expression, but that is the reality. The world has been turned upside down .Vz, we are at the end of the black summer of jihad. In case people have forgotten what the followers of Allah and Mohammed are capable of and what our open borders lead to, let us recall the events of last summer. a list. I think the victims deserve that. I also think that the House and the Netherlands should hear that. Every incident because it is a shocking reality. The truth of this summer. Every week, sometimes every day, sometimes twice in one day, the jihad in Europe, the jihad in the West. President, What happened: June 12: A 30-year-old Muslim kills 49 people in a gay bar in Orlando, Florida. June 13: A police chief and his wife are stabbed to death in Magnanville near Paris by a 25-year-old Frenchman of Moroccan descent shouting Allahu Akbhar. June 29: 3 ISIS terrorists kill 45 innocent people in an attack on Istanbul's Ataturk airport. Muslims are also the victims of Islam. July 14: A Tunisian with a residence permit uses a truck on the boulevard in Nice as a murder weapon, resulting in 86 deaths. ISIS immediately celebrates this attack by beheading two French-speaking prisoners in Mosul, Iraq. July 18: A 17-year-old Afghan asylum seeker chops while shouting Allahu Akbhar attacks train passengers with an ax in Heidingsfeld, Germany, injuring five people, three seriously.

July 24: A 21-year-old Syrian asylum seeker kills a pregnant woman with a machete in the German city of Reutlingen and injures two others and on the same day blows 27-year-old Syrian refugee Mohammed D. committed himself at a music festival in Ansbach, Germany. July 26: Two Syrians slit the throat of an 85-year-old pastor during the church service while shouting Allahu Akbhar in a church in St-Etienne-du- Rouvray in France. During the service. July 27: In Troisdorf, Germany, a Palestinian shouting Allahu Akbhar attacks a surgeon with a knife and wants to behead him. August 4: A 19-year-old Somali who immigrated to Norway stabs and injures a woman five others in Russel Square in London. August 6: A 33-year-old Algerian attacks police officers with a machete in Charleroi, Belgium, shouting Allahu Akbhar.

September 8: Three women controlled by ISIS are arrested in connection with a planned terrorist act and the discovery of a car with seven gas bottles and several jerry cans near the Notre Dame in Paris. September 9: A Salafist man shouting Allahu Akbar attacks police officers in the Serbian city of Raska. September 17: A Somali man attacks nine people with a knife in a shopping center in St. Cloud, Minnesota. The same day : 29 injured in an attack in New York committed by an Afghan. Ex, I still had to make a selection. This is not even the whole reality. I could have spent my entire speech on this, what happened in the West in the name of Islam in recent weeks. The perpetrators are always the same: Islamic barbarians. Headhunters of Allah. And the victims are also always the same: innocent people, Muslim and non-Muslim, who did not ask for this and we certainly do too. did not ask for that imported misery. In our own country we also see increasing violence from Poelenburg to Spijkenisse. Around Ramadan we saw how stones are thrown through the windows of buses and how Dutch people are attacked in their own country for drinking water. Cars in the fire. Women harassed. A few weeks ago: a 17-year-old girl from Kampen was raped on the roadside by an asylum-seeking testosterone bomb. Why is no one talking about that? In Deventer, an asylum seeker tries to rape a six-year-old girl. Why is no one talking about it? about that? Holidaymakers stood in line for hours at Schiphol because of the jihad. Even the Efteling may have been a target. And the great massacre, that terrible massacre at the airport and the metro in Brussels, as we later learned, was actually planned for our country. It should have been a massacre of Dutch people. Future generations will look back on what this cabinet has done. And the judgment will be extremely harsh. We have lost our minds, we have not listened to reality, we have politically correct the other We have to look away because otherwise we might be criticized. What has this cabinet done? They have done nothing. What they have done is abolish the criminalization of illegality. The detention of aliens has been phased out. A new general pardon has been introduced. A bed-bath-bread scheme has been introduced. Asylum records have been broken. I remember well, Madam President, that I stood here last year and said that there was a great danger in that asylum flow, that terrorists were coming with it, and I was ridiculed, ridiculed , even called a kind of idiot by a D66 member of the European Parliament. She tweeted: He is crazy, that Wilders, there is no evidence whatsoever for that, how is that possible. And guess what? It happens, and it happens more often. than we think. Attacks have been committed in Brussels and Paris by people who we now know have hitched a ride on the influx of asylum seekers. And I said it. And they did not want to listen. And innocent people have been murdered. That is the reality. Why is no one talking about that? Vz, in this election year the differences have never been so great and the disappointments and contradictions never so clear. And I know what needs to be done. And I also see what is happening demographically. Look to Africa. Africa is about to explode demographically. By the end of this century, 4 billion people will live there. Even the EU expects that 1 million migrants will come per year from now on. I don't blame those people. I understand that they come to us want to come. But we can't handle that. We don't have the money for it either. And they often bring with them a culture that is not ours. And many also want to dominate us, they also want to use violence for that. That is possible. we do not allow. It is not just about identity, it is not just about norms and values, it is also about numbers. If we allow hundreds of thousands, if we allow millions of people into our country from a different culture, people who hate us, people who hate our lifestyle, people who hate it when a woman walks in a short skirt, people who don't want gays to walk hand in hand, if we don't do something about it, the Netherlands will disappear, we will lose our country. Why has no one about that? Why aren't we talking about that? That's the problem. We have an existential problem. Well, if we don't do anything we won't survive. Then we will be colonized, we will become Islamized. Then people will say later: yes, If only we had done something, if only we had listened, we should have done something. Why is no one talking about this, VZ? We don't want any more jihadists from Syria. Erdogan's long arm must go. We do not want to be dominated by a culture that is not ours. 1 million people per year. It is unbelievable what will happen if we don't do that. I already said it: we must protect our country, we must ensure that people respect our rules, we must ensure that that ideology of hatred and violence, precisely that ideology that is contrary to the constitution, no longer gains a foothold here. Vz, There is no middle ground. Because of the delay, because of the politically correct If we do nothing, it is actually already five past twelve. And I tell you: if we do not act now, if we do not close our borders now, if we do not throw cultural relativism far from us, if we do not ensure that we are proud again who we are and who we are not, will be deported from our country, if we don't do that, if we accept that people make fun of us, terrorize us, rape our women and do what we don't want, then it's over for us. Either we deal with Islam, or Islam will deal with us! That is why I propose closing borders, stopping mosques and all those proposals you know from us. Make illegality punishable, send asylum seekers back, I already have them here. often mentioned, I don't think I need to repeat them. But they have one thing in common. And that is that only the PVV proposals protect our constitutional state, that only our PVV proposals guarantee that the Dutch people will still exist in a while. If we fail, then it's over and done with the Netherlands. Our civilization is gone. Our freedoms are gone. Our safety is gone. Our lives are worthless. Our rule of law is thrown in the trash, our freedom is gone, the Netherlands is gone, and we have to deal with that. The government now thinks it can appease people with a festive budget. But no one is falling for that. An additional percentage of purchasing power while healthcare has been cut off, the deductible is 385 euros, rents have been increased, pensions have been cut. The Netherlands is falling for that. We have seen what the government has done in recent months and in recent years with pensions, with rent, with home care, you name it. People do not believe this cabinet. People do not believe that the cabinet is doing the right thing. The Netherlands has for. Can I take healthcare as an example? What has this Prime Minister and this cabinet done for healthcare? They have closed nursing homes, halved domestic help, set the deductible to 385 euros. In the Netherlands of Prime Minister Rutte More and more Dutch people are avoiding care because they cannot pay the deductible, ambulances are peddling critically ill patients because emergency rooms are overcrowded, cancer patients do not always receive the right treatment because the hospital has run out of money. In the Netherlands of Prime Minister Rutte, the elderly are in our nursing homes sometimes drugged to starve, to dehydrate and, above all, to be lonely because there are too few nurses. In the Netherlands of Prime Minister Rutte, men and women of 70, 80, sometimes even 90 years old walk on the streets, confused and sometimes even half naked, because aid has been cut back. It is shameful that we treat our elderly this way. In short, in the Netherlands of Prime Minister Rutte, care was cut short. And how embarrassing it is to hear such a good weather story yesterday. We must make the right choices, we must make better choices, we must look to the future. That is only possible if we not only make the right choices but if we also ignore political cowardice and look the other way, which we are doing now, if we put that aside, Vz, let me tell you what I think the future can look like. Unfortunately, it is often still a dream because no one wants to listen, but I hope people will listen. I dream of a Netherlands where schoolchildren do not have the Islam is being shoved down people's throats. I dream of a Netherlands where women can choose their own clothes, without having to think about what intolerant Muslims think about it. I dream of a Netherlands where gays can walk hand in hand through the Schilderswijk, where Jews with will walk through Kanaleneiland wearing a yarmulke. I dream of a Netherlands where Poelenburg, Tarwewijk, Oosterwei, you name it, are safe again. Where Zwarte Piet can still be celebrated. Where Ebru Umar is not chased and betrayed by click -Turks. What a hero that woman is and why is no one talking about it? Why is no one talking about it? I dream of a Netherlands where Islam is nothing more than a nightmare that passed away. I dream of that Netherlands. And millions of Dutch people dream with me. And that dream is once again shared by millions of people throughout Europe. And I am also convinced that the Netherlands can become a reality. My colleagues and I come here every day because we are convinced that the Netherlands can come. The Netherlands as it has always been, a Netherlands in which the Dutch are central, where the money we now spend on immigration and asylum and Europe and development aid, that we spend that money on the Dutch. It is crazy for words that you are almost called a racist if you say that you think we should spend our money here in the Netherlands on our people. It is unbelievable. And that is what we want. How is it possible that asylum seekers in Brabant Oisterwijk receive a check for 10,000 euros to furnish their house while 600,000 Dutch people live in poverty? Am I crazy or are they crazy? How is that possible? What kind of madness is that? And that doesn't happen in my Netherlands. And yes, in my Netherlands, we deport people with dual nationality if they commit a crime. Because we choose civilisation. We choose for the elderly, we do not choose the dismantling of healthcare, we choose for the Dutch. This is what my Netherlands looks like. It is a decent Netherlands. But above all it is a free and proud Netherlands. A Netherlands that chooses its own people.

182939.0," Dear people, we are going into battle with this great list. We are going to run a fantastic campaign with this list. Reconquer the Netherlands. With this list we're going to flame. I hereby declare the election campaign of the Party for Freedom officially open! Images of Geert Wilders' speech on Nos.nl Read ""Wilders wants to 'reconquer' the Netherlands"" on Telegraaf.nl Read ""Wilders mainly opposes Cohen"" on AD. nlRead ""Wilders attacks Cohen: 'the man without a spine'"" on Elsevier.nl People, did you see Zembla yesterday? There we were compared by the state broadcaster to Nazis, Milosevic and ethnic cleansers. Yes, where would we be without the state broadcaster. From all of us, for all of us. But apart from that: the name of the program clearly indicates where we should send those left-wing activists once we have taken them off the subsidy drip: To Nova Zembla. They themselves are convinced that the earth is warming, so they will go there I'm sure we have no objection to it. On Friday we presented our election manifesto. And today our campaign starts. There was only one place where we could do that: here in Rotterdam, here in South Rotterdam. Because this is no ordinary city. This is the city of Coen Moulijn and Pietje Bell. But more than anything: this is the city of Pim Fortuyn. The man who paid for his ideals with his life. This is also the city that, like no other, is creaking at the seams as a result of mass immigration and Islamization. Entire neighborhoods are Islamized. What was once the largest port city in the world is now the capital of Eurabia. A city of minarets and a mega mosque. There has never been any doubt about it. We could only get started here in the city of Pim Fortuyn. And that's what we're doing tonight. Here in Rotterdam we plant our flag and start the reconquest of the Netherlands. We believe that the most beautiful days of the Netherlands are still ahead of us. That we are facing a future that is many times more wonderful than what we have behind us. If we only dare, if we dare to choose. On June 9, the Netherlands can choose. We choose optimism and hope. Our election manifesto is the agenda for hope and optimism. The best election programme, which can count on broad support among many Dutch people. We are tough where necessary and soft where possible. If you say: I agree with that program, then you are not alone. Maurice de Hond has gauged our positions, and it turns out: the voter agrees with us on many points. The aversion to mass immigration, the aversion to Islam and the opposition to Europe. The Netherlands is more PVV-minded than the state broadcaster will ever let you know. Scrap the JSF, ten thousand nurses will be added to healthcare. The Netherlands wants it. They are only against it in the canal belt and Hilversum. We opt for the people who do not get it as a gift in the Netherlands. We choose Henk and Ingrid. Ordinary Dutch people who work hard and are concerned about safety in their city, neighborhood and street, about mass immigration and Islamization, about poor care for their parents, about high taxes, about the economic crisis, about student finance. their children.And the PVV wants to govern. We want to change the Netherlands. We want to take responsibility. Without the PVV in a new government, the Netherlands will sink further into a swamp of politically correct inaction. Without the PVV, the problems of the Netherlands will not be solved but will worsen. And don't forget: the CDA, the PvdA and the VVD are parties that have all done it together before in recent decades, have governed together in purple to center-right or other cabinets. We've all seen it. We've seen it all before. They've made a big mess of it again. That could happen again after June 9. A vote for Mark Rutte or Jan Peter Balkenende could easily be a vote for Job Cohen or Alexander Pechtold. What the Netherlands needs is a strong PVV that can put things in order. We are a party that wants to solve problems, even if that does not suit the political elite, even if the solutions are difficult. About mass immigration and Islam, about healthcare, about crime and high taxes, about cutting left-wing hobbies and about tackling the economic crisis. The PVV is desperately needed to make the Netherlands a stronger country. For a strong but also social policy, there is no better choice than a vote for our PVV! The PVV offers the Netherlands hope and optimism. But we know: it is a hope without illusions. Because we see what is going on in our country. More and more citizens are wondering whether their future still lies in the Netherlands. Tens of thousands of Dutch people are leaving our cities, tens of thousands of Dutch people are leaving our country. The question of why The Hague continues with disastrous measures that are not supported by our people is being asked by more and more Dutch people. Meanwhile, many have the feeling that we are losing the Netherlands. Neighborhood after neighborhood, street after street, school after school. Mass immigration reached a sad record and is likely to explode further in the coming years. Crime is rampant and anyone who watches Two Minutes of Opsporing Verzocht knows that crime is often the result of the Sinterklaasje-come-in-with-your-servant policy. The diagnosis is the same for many of the problems that plague the Netherlands. : elites have become detached from reality and have started doing things on their own that do not benefit ordinary people. Our elites have converted to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã'anything should be possible'. There is no good or evil, all cultures are equal, whether it is Islam or Christianity, shaking hands or not, who cares. The left-wing rulers have also united with Islam. The left and Islam work together. The left-wing elite happily closes its eyes to reality: oppression of women, hatred of gays, benefit dependence, street terrorism, hostility towards democracy, etc. Our pride that the Dutch have paid for with conviction for decades, the welfare state, has become a magnet for fortune seekers. No longer a shield for the weak, but a pick-up counter for loitering immigrants. And who pays for that? That's you. Henk and Ingrid pay for Ali and Fatima. Are we powerless? Should we passively watch as everything we hold dear is destroyed by that unhinged elite? Of course not. The Netherlands must opt ‚Äã‚Äãfor solutions. We can do anything if we want. Our ancestors saw a swampy swamp delta and said: this will be an oasis. Rotterdammers once saw their city bombed to rubble and said: they should pull together. The Party for Freedom sees a country that is sinking further and further into the swamp and says: dig in! Pim Fortuyn already said it: ‚ÄúThis country is fed up. C'est ca, that's what I stand for."" The PVV chooses pre-eminently for the people who do not receive it as a gift. The Party for Freedom opts for a social Netherlands. We are happy to pay for ten thousand extra nurses, with a higher salary, in the nursing homes for our elderly. We are also against an increase in the deductible in healthcare. We will stay away from student financing and the annual public transport pass. We do not qualify for unemployment benefits and mortgage interest deductions. We do not want any relaxation of dismissal law and the state pension must remain at 65. The PVV wants an economically prosperous Netherlands. Where citizens and entrepreneurs pay as little tax as possible, so that they can spend their own money in the way they want. A Netherlands that does not stand still, but moves, meaning more roads and no kilometer tax. We opt for a small government, without too much patronizing. For a sparkling democracy, with referenda. No European superstate, but economic cooperation. No network of subsidized left-wing action groups. And above all: for a safe Netherlands where the scum is arrested and deported, and not subsidized and cuddled. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not the only party participating in the elections. The PvdA thought: you know what. The mayor of Amsterdam will be our candidate. What he has done for Amsterdam, he can also do for the whole of the Netherlands. The question is whether that is a promise or a threat. We are increasingly finding out what Job Cohen has actually done for Amsterdam. Not so much for the original inhabitants. They now live in Almere and Purmerend. But he has been on hand 24 hours a day for fortune seekers. Job Cohen is one hundred percent pro-Islam. He finances a radical mosque. The mayor of the canal belt advocates an Islamic culture in the Netherlands. According to him, learning Dutch is not necessary. Cohen literally says: we must accept Muslims who discriminate against their wives. He doesn't even have to shake hands with women. You can order something tasty in the canteen of the Amsterdam police force. A Cohen sandwich. That's a limp meat sandwich. It is then said: ‚ÄúTasty, without backbone‚Äù. Cohen is called a beach ball by his own police chief, blowing with all the winds. The PvdA is the party of double passports. The PvdA used to have a red flag. Now it is the red carpet club. The red carpet for Islam. People, I say: The Netherlands does not need beach balls, but leadership. Friends, on June 9 you can place your order in the canteen of our democracy. Then you can decide for yourself whether you want a sandwich with or without a backbone. Dear people, put it in your agenda. We have a party on June 9. Then we will celebrate that the PVV has achieved a mega win. Until then, we will be burning across the country with this group of greats and our thousands of volunteers. We'll start with that now. Our volunteers will be out starting tonight. They go door to door and distribute hundreds of thousands of pamphlets with our message throughout the Netherlands. Today, here, in Rotterdam, the reconquest of the Netherlands begins. Are we powerless? No, of course not. Against more of the same, we place decisiveness. Against Islam, we place our identity. Against multiculturalism, patriotism. Against the canal belt, Henk and Ingrid. Against the breakdown of social Netherlands, protecting the citizen. Against pessimism, ten thousand new nurses and ten thousand new police officers. Against the cultural relativistic malaise, we place Dutch hope and optimism. And against Job Cohen, more safety and less immigration. Dear people, we are going for it! Choose list 5, choose Party for Freedom! Thank you!

183242.0,"The threat of Europeanization and the need to defend the nation stateThank you for inviting me to Berlin.It is an honor to be here in this wonderful city of Berlin.When I was here last year, I emphasized how important Germany is for We all benefit from a healthy, democratic, self-confident Germany. A lot has happened since my last visit. We have been able to achieve a lot of amazing things in the Netherlands. We have successfully started the process of Islamizing the Netherlands We did this peacefully and through a democratic process. Recently, a deranged, narcissistic psychopath from Norway committed a terrible crime. He murdered almost 80 innocent citizens in cold blood. The assassin pretended to be a concerned European. He said he had committed these atrocities because it was ""meaningless to participate in the democratic process."" But he is wrong. The Oslo mass murderer murdered and mutilated people, and he justified this heinous crime by denying - and I quote - ""that it was even remotely ""It is possible to change the system democratically"" - end of quote.But he is wrong.The Oslo murderer falsely claims that he is one of us.But he is not one of us.We abhor violence.We are democrats.We believe of peaceful solutions.The reason we reject Islam is precisely the violent nature of Islam.We believe in democracy.We fight with the power of our beliefs, but we never use violence.Our commitment to truth, human dignity and a just and honorable defense of the West does not allow us to use violence, nor to give in to cynicism or despair. We value the traditions of Aleksander Solzhenitsyn, Yelena Bonner, Lech Walesa and Ronald Reagan. These heroes defeated a totalitarian ideology through power of their conviction and without firing a single shot. As the ex-Muslim and Islam critic Ali Sina said in response to the Oslo massacre: We do not raise a sword against the darkness, we light a light. That's how it is. We light the light of truth. And the truth will set us free.The truth is that Islam can be fought successfully through democratic means.We are doing it in the Netherlands.You can do it in Germany too.Let me tell you what we have been doing in the Netherlands since my last Visit to Berlin less than a year ago. It will encourage you. What can be achieved in the Netherlands can also be achieved in Germany. My party, the Freedom Party, which holds 24 seats of the 150 seats in Parliament, supports a minority government of liberals and Christian Democrats. We do this in return for restricting immigration, curbing crime, stopping cultural relativization and restoring our traditional Western freedoms, such as freedom of speech. The Party for Freedom is now less than a year in this position, but we are achieving great things. We have achieved that the Netherlands will soon ban burqas and niqabs that cover the face. We will reduce immigration from non-Western countries in the next four years reduce up to 50 percent!We will revoke Dutch citizenship from criminals with dual citizenship who have repeatedly committed serious crimes!The Party for Freedom brings a message of hope to the Netherlands.The new policy will place more demands on immigrants.Integration is not tailored specifically for each group. Tougher action will be taken against immigrants who do not respect the law. Those who reduce their chance of getting a job through their clothing will have less access to welfare state benefits. We have also achieved that anti -Israeli activities will no longer be subsidized by Dutch taxes. So-called humanitarian aid organizations that directly or indirectly support anti-Israel boycotts, divestments and sanctions and that deny Israel the right to exist will no longer receive money from the government. The Dutch government will support the Durban III -Boycott the Conference Against Racial Discrimination because it has turned into a tribunal for accusations against Israel. The government will strengthen our political and economic ties with Israel. Investing, rather than withdrawing holdings, will be our policy towards Israel. We stand for Israel. We love Israel.Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.Israel is part of our culture.My friends, what the Party for Freedom has achieved shows that we can do it.To borrow a phrase from President Obama: Yes, we can !We can stop the Islamization of our societies.The Dutch example shows that we can win.David can defeat Goliath.Last July the Dutch government even did something that no other government had dared to do before.It steadfastly raised its voice against the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.The OIC is an international organization of 57 Islamic countries, most of them barbaric dictatorships.This OIC forms the largest voting bloc at the United Nations.It had criticized the fact that Dutch judges cleared me of all charges Insulting a group, inciting hatred and discrimination. But the Dutch government made it clear to the OIC that freedom of expression in the Netherlands will not be silenced. It told the OIC bluntly: ""The Dutch government completely distances itself from the demand to silence a politician"" - end of quote.We will never submit to the Islamic OIC tyrants.As you probably know, I endured the torment of being a suspect in a criminal case for two years.I was in Amsterdam went to court on charges of hate speech. Last June, this farce ended with a complete acquittal. The Dutch learned from my acquittal that the political debate in their country has not yet been stifled. My acquittal was a victory for freedom of expression. The Dutch also learned that they are allowed to express themselves critically about Islam. They learned that resistance to Islamization is not a crime. They learned that there is hope and that liberation is near. My acquittal marks the change of tide. Not only in the Netherlands, but throughout Europe. It is the first breach of the dam. We have started the resistance. We have sent a message to the ideologues of Islam. Don't trample on us! My acquittal has a meaning that goes far beyond the Netherlands. It has a meaning for all of Europe and the Free World. My acquittal legitimizes criticism of Islam. It also does this in Germany and everywhere else. In fact, why shouldn't you Germans enjoy the same rights as the Dutch! If peaceful and democratic resistance to Islamization is not a crime is in the Netherlands, why should it be one in Germany? So here's my message to you: Continue your fight for freedom and freedom of speech! Don't let your politicians and judges guarantee you fewer rights than the Dutch. Let Do not be intimidated by Islamic and leftist opponents who scream and shout. Do not be intimidated by the media claiming that a murderer who has lost his faith in the democratic process was somehow influenced by us, my friends, when I last told you year, never in my wildest dreams could I imagine that we could influence government policy the way we did. That's why I tell you: never give in to the people who want to intimidate you! Never give up hope! Desperate never! You can always turn the tide. You can always turn the tide. It's true: Germany is not in the same fortunate position as the Netherlands. When I was here last year, Thilo Sarrazin had just published his book ‚ÄúGermany creates itself from"" was published. Sarrazin's book was a bestseller. It touched a nerve. Over one and a half million copies were sold. This shows that German society is ripe for a change. But politically, Sarrazin's book has not yet changed anything. On the contrary, Germany's political elite increased the speed of Islamization in Germany. Federal President Wulff said: ‚ÄúIslam belongs to Germany.‚Äù Chancellor Merkel said multiculturalism has absolutely failed, but she continues to defend Turkey's accession to the EU. The spread of Islam continues unabated in German classrooms and on Germany's streets through the construction of new mosques etc. etc. Your situation has changed worsened because - so far - you don't have a party with enough voter support to change German politics for the better. Germany needs a right-wing party that is not burdened with neo-Nazi connections and anti-Semitism, but that is decent and respectable and also is steadfast.Ren√© Stadtkewitz is working very hard to make Die Freiheit as successful as the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands.Ren√©, are here to help you!Because Germany deserves a better fate than it is getting today.Mine Friends, your country is the political backbone of Europe. Germany is the most populous country in Europe. Germany is the economic engine of Europe. If Germany is sick, we are all sick. Last year I warned you: Stop being ashamed of Germany .It is unfair to reduce German patriotism to National Socialism, just as it is unfair to reduce Russia to Stalinism. Be proud of your country. Only if the Germans are proud of Germany will they be able to stand for To stand up for Germany and defend Germany. And you have to stand up for Germany, just like the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands stands up for the Netherlands. We all have to stand up for the survival of our nation states because our nation states embody the democratic freedoms that we enjoy.Without the nation state there can be no complete national political freedom.That is why we must be good patriots.Patriotism is often branded as fascism.But patriotism is not fascism.On the contrary.Every democrat and defender of freedom must be a patriot by definition. A soul needs a body. The spirit of political freedom cannot thrive outside the body of the nation state. The nation state is the political body in which we live. That is why we must preserve and nurture the nation state. This is how we can promote freedom and democracy, that we enjoy, pass on to our children. Without a nation state, without self-government, without self-determination, there can be neither security for a people nor the preservation of its identity. This was the insight that led the Zionists to re-establish the State of Israel .Theodor Herzl said that there must be a Jewish state because - and I quote - ""what we want is a new flowering of the Jewish spirit"".Dear friends, we urgently need a new flowering of the German spirit.The Germans have been ashamed for decades for themselves.They preferred to be Europeans rather than Germans.And they paid a dear price for it.We all paid a dear price for it.Europe is not a nation; it is a bundle of nations. Europe's strength is its diversity. We are one family, but we live in different bodies.Our cultures are the branches of a common Judeo-Christian and humanist culture, but we have different national cultural identities.And that is how it should be.Uniformity is a characteristic of Islam, but it is not Europe.Islam erased the national identity of the peoples it conquered.The Coptic identity of Egypt, the Indian identity of Pakistan, the Assyrian identity of Iraq, the Persian identity of Iran, all were wiped away, fought against or discriminated against except for the today.Islam wants to replace all nations with the so-called Ummah, the common identity of the nation of Islam, to which everyone must submit and in which all national identities must be submerged.Islam tried to conquer Europe, but so far has not been successful. That's why we Europeans have been able to develop our own different identities as nation states. If we want to keep them, we have to stand together against the powers that threaten our identities. Today we are confronted with two dangerous forces: Islamization and Europeanization. When I last year was here, I spoke in detail about the threat of Islam. Today I want to draw your attention to the threat of Europeanization. By Europeanization I mean the ideology that demands that our sovereign nation-states should merge into a pan-European superstate. The founding fathers of European Union believed that in order to avoid a future war in Europe, the European nations, and especially Germany, should be included in what the treaty called ""an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe."" Robert Schuman said that it was the goal of the EU is - I quote - ""making war not only unthinkable, but materially impossible"" - end of quote. The Eurocrats think that nation states in general - and Germany in particular, Europe's largest nation state - are the problem. They are wrong. The The real reason for the Second World War was not the German nation state - it was the totalitarianism of the Nazis. There is no problem with Germany. The reason for the war was Nazi ideology. The cure for totalitarianism is not the formation of a superstate. That The remedy is to introduce more direct forms of democracy down to the lowest possible levels. Instead of stripping Germany and other nation states of their sovereignty, the post-war leaders in our countries should have introduced a system like Switzerland's. Small units should have a high degree of local sovereignty .The individual citizen should be given a direct democratic say over his own fate and that of his community. Instead, the peoples of Europe have been stripped of their sovereignty, which has been moved to far away Brussels. Decisions are now made behind closed doors by unelected bureaucrats. This is not the type of democracy we want! We want less bureaucracy! We want more democracy! We want to keep our own sovereignty. We want to govern ourselves! We want to remain independent and free! We want to be masters in our own house. In December 1991, the Maastricht Treaty called for a single European currency. The Dutch guilder and the Deutsche Mark were sacrificed on the altar of European unification. Helmut Kohl sold this project to the Germans as - and I quote - ""a question of war or peace "" - End of quote.The euro was presented as ""an angel of peace"" that the Germans should sponsor by abandoning the Deutsche Mark.During the past six decades, German politicians have told Germans that the nation state, and Germany in particular, is so dangerous that they must be weakened.The Germans had to become Europeans instead of Germans.In order to achieve this political project, national and monetary sovereignty was surrendered.Economic and national interests were sacrificed on the altar of so-called Europeanization.All countries that joined the Euro , lost the power to adjust their currencies to their own economic needs. They have all suffered as a consequence. Some countries' currencies are undervalued, others' currencies are overvalued; all of them must collectively bear the burdens of other countries, even if the latter suffer from self-inflicted problems, corruption or fraud. Europe's monetary system has given some countries a free pass at the expense of others, with those who cheat being the ones who foot the bill , can blackmail. This farce must stop. As Theodor Herzl said: People's character can be ruined by charity. This applies to the recipients of the benefits, but also to the donors. The so-called pan-European solidarity is literally ruining us. We already have enough for Europe paid.The same applies to the Netherlands.Our citizens do not have to pay for other people's debts!My friends, your party Freedom embodies the best hope for Germany.Since your party is the only one in Germany that has the courage to speak loudly and to say clearly that countries that cannot pay their debts should leave the euro. I completely agree: countries in crisis should leave the euro! My friends, time is running out. We must for the sake of democracy and for the future well-being of our Children act. Former Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky warns that the European project is making conflict more likely rather than preventing war. He draws a parallel between the EU and the former Soviet Union, which also suppressed the feelings of individual nationalities. Than the economic reality defeated the Soviet political project, the suppressed feelings of the various nationalities came back with force and destroyed the Union. Bukovsky fears that the same thing can happen in Europe if we do not stop the expansion of the European juggernaut. European leaders claim that the The only way to stop the current crisis is even more European rule. They are demanding more power for Brussels. They are wrong. More Europe only makes everything worse. We have to stand up to their attempt at further centralization. We don't want more Europe! The EU lacks democracy, responsibility and transparency. That's why we reject it in this form. We want less Europe! Let's hope that the German Federal Constitutional Court protects national sovereignty next Wednesday. As a national legislator in the Netherlands, I live to see it every day, how little we still have to say about our own fate. We are expected to wave through laws made by Brussels. The 27 EU commissioners meet with their colleagues behind closed doors. They negotiate in secret and take action then forward to announce their agreements. This is how this system works. Recently your Chancellor, Mrs. Merkel, went to Paris. Together with President Sarkozy, she announced plans for an economic government in the Eurozone. We are against it. We want our national parliaments decide our economic policy. We do not want to spend our taxpayers' money in Eurozone countries such as Greece. Leave those who have cheated us, who have mismanaged their economies, or who have foolishly lived beyond their means, to their own devices worries.In addition, the EU treaties prohibit so-called 'bailouts'.The Party for Freedom is against any bailout.The Dutch minority government cannot rely on our support in this regard.Today this euro policy, which is going in the wrong direction, is being supported by the Europhiles left opposition parties. I repeat: we will never support the Dutch government in its bailout plans, even if the government would lose the support of the left. We have voted and we will vote against any plan to help other countries out of financial difficulties help.Sovereign states must look after themselves.That is what sovereignty means: freedom and the ability to look after themselves.Our peoples resent the fact that they have to pay for others.Our peoples resent the permanent divestment of power from their nation states. They care about their nation because they care about democracy and freedom and the well-being of their children. They see their democratic rights and their centuries-old freedoms in their national flag. But it is more than that. National identity binds an individual to a heritage, tradition, loyalty and culture. National identity is also an inclusive identity. It considers every person, regardless of religion or race, who is willing to join the nation as an equal assimilate by sharing the fate and future of a people. My friends, we must return political power to the nation state, in the name of democracy, in the name of freedom, in the name of human dignity. By defending the nation states, we defend our own identity.By defending our identity, we defend our freedoms.By defending our freedom, we defend our dignity.I call on you: Stand up for the nation state.Be proud of your country!In his farewell address as American President said Ronald Reagan said that what he was most proud of during his presidency was - and I quote - ""the resurgence of national pride, which I called the 'New Patriotism'"" - end of quote. Europe needs new patriotic currents. We need the True Finns and True Danes, True French and True Irish, True Dutch and, my friends, we need True Germans. Reagan said that we must teach our children what our country is, what it stands for and what it is about in the long run history of the world. He said that Americans need - and I quote - ""a love for the country and an appreciation of its institutions."" Reagan's words also apply to us Europeans. We need a revival of national pride, a love for the country and its Institutions.Our national parliaments are our democratic institutions.We must defend them.Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I have said enough.It is time to act.We must hurry.The time for Germany, for the Netherlands, for everyone the other major nations of Europe is running out. As Ronald Reagan said, ""We must act today to preserve tomorrow."" Here is a quick summary of five things we must do to preserve our freedoms: First, we must protect freedom of expression defend.It is the most important of our freedoms.Secondly, we must end cultural relativism.Our Western culture is far superior to other cultures.Thirdly, we must stop Islamization.More Islam means less freedom.There is already enough Islam in Europe.Immigrants must assimilate and adapt to our values. Fourth, we must restore the right to decide about our own money. We should not pay other people's debts. The survival of the euro should not be used as an excuse to reward countries that have shown that they are not worth belonging to the Eurozone.Fifth, we must restore the supremacy and sovereignty of the nation state.Our nations are the inheritance that our fathers left us and that we want to pass on to our children.We are the free men and women of West.We are the true men and women of the West.We do not stand for a superstate.We stand for our own country.You stand for Germany.I stand for the Netherlands.Others stand for Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, France, Spain and all the other freedom-loving nations of Europe.Together we represent the nations of Europe.We stand together.We will stand firm.We will survive.We will defend our freedoms.We will remain free.I wish the party Die Freiheit and Ren√© Stadtkewitz good luck in the House of Representatives elections on September 18th.

163909.0," On the day it is announced that HP/De Tijd has named Emile 'man of 2011', the Tribune interviews him about the year 2011. How are we doing? text: Diederik Olders photo: Suzanne van de Kerk ‚Ä∫ HP/De Tijd believes that you have left your biggest mark on last year, more than Prime Minister Rutte and Johan Cruijff... 'It is a very nice compliment to be selected from such a list of 43 nominees to be chosen. Apparently I have been noticed this year - or better said: apparently the SP has been noticed this year. Of course, this was also the year in which I had to make it happen. In 2010 it was all new, it wasn't too bad, the big unknown that is there anyway. Only this year we looked at whether the SP and I could hold our ground. Apparently that worked.' ‚Ä∫ Why is that? 'Everything has to come together. You have to tackle the right topics. We have a strong parliamentary faction with experienced people. Because new working groups have been started in 67 municipalities this year, there are suddenly many new enthusiastic SP members in the media.' ‚Ä∫ 2011 is the year of... 'The year of Europe and us alike. And the year that it becomes clear to people that the government's policy is causing a growing divide in our country. For some people, 2011 is the year of Mauro, for others the year of the Social Work Places, or the GGZ, the PGB, special education; These are all topics that arise from that cold policy.' ‚Ä∫ And Europe? 'Yesterday, ex-minister Hoogervorst plainly admitted that the euro is a major failure. Minister De Jager admitted in the Senate that different choices should have been made. And slowly but surely people are starting to realize that the SP has always been right. We warned about it years ago: the freedom of financial markets, the introduction of the euro, the differences between the economies of Northern and Southern Europe, the system of perverse incentives in financial markets, flash capital, hedge funds. Now the system is so far gone that politicians can do little more than muddle through. Solutions are jealously clung to within a system that is bankrupt: neoliberal casino capitalism that has grown into a monster over the past fifteen years. And it is so far gone that whatever we do, it will always cost a lot of money. The SP says: you must tackle the underlying problems. So curb the financial markets, tax and split banks. And above all, do not let yourself be held hostage by the whims of the financial market.' ‚Ä∫ You now have to regularly hold debates about these complex topics. Can it be kept up? 'It is indeed going fast. Look, of course we have our financial spokesperson, Ewout Irrgang, but I need to know everything in general terms. And those main points are already complex enough. And not just in the field of international finance. Tomorrow it will be nanotechnology, then nuclear energy, then stem cell research, driving 130 kilometers per hour, health insurance. If something is going on and you come across a journalist, you cannot stand there with your mouth full of teeth. You learn an awful lot, and that's the fun part about it. As a faction leader, it is also easy to get informed. If I want to be updated about something, all doors fly open. I do that a lot too; the more I get outside The Hague, the better it is.' December 2010: One of the leaders of the great cleaning strike, Christine Monk-Simon, has been to Japan to receive the international trade union prize for the best trade union action. She says in the Tribune: 'I told them that we can only get something done if we do it together. The strikers have built up a family bond, across all cultures. I am even more proud of that than the prize.' December 2011: Monk-Simon is in Velzen to negotiate with employers about the new collective labor agreement: 'We want work to be adapted when people turn fifty. Otherwise it's too heavy. Furthermore, a wage increase of 50 cents per hour, and the travel allowance that we had to give up last year. I think we're going to come a long way. They know we are ready to strike again. They know us now and they know we are unstoppable. That family bond has remained. In the preparation for the negotiations, we asked people whether they were willing to strike again. Well, there was! The battle does not end with one success. We will continue.' ‚Ä∫ Which visit made a big impression on you? 'Then I have to mention the visits to Kenya and Israel. The extreme hopelessness in the refugee camps in Kenya, the poverty in the slums of Nairobi; you will never forget that. Just like the gigantic contradictions in Israel and the Palestinian areas. And the complete lack of trust there is in each other. And to see the youth demonstrating in Jerusalem, Israeli and Palestinian youth shoulder to shoulder, for peace and a two-state solution, saying to their leaders: go do something; that made a big impression.' ‚Ä∫ Have you changed because you are group leader? 'That's hard to say about yourself. Like I said, you learn a lot. And I think I've become a little more confident. But I can hope that my character is the same as two or ten years ago, that I am basically the same.' ‚Ä∫ Do you still play football? 'Just once. I would like to, but it is very difficult. You're already busy, and then all kinds of unexpected things always come up. Such as the election by HP/De Tijd.' ‚Ä∫ This gives you a great opportunity to make our voice heard. 'Yes, it's like good polls. Look, I'd rather be at 27 than at 8 seats in the polls, but they're just polls. Think of Rita Verdonk who stood on 27 seats and achieved exactly 0 in the elections, or think of Rutte who not so long ago stood on 12 seats in the polls. But still, people look at a party that is doing well. And the media tend to ask the opinion of those who matter, and then they also look at polls. So it offers opportunities. Also for the party. Your active members become more enthusiastic, if you organize something more people come to it, you name it.' SP MP Sharon Gesthuizen pokes her head around the door of Emile's office and congratulates him on his election. They briefly discuss Sharon's television appearance that evening. When she has left, Emile says: 'Look, that is also a sign of the good atmosphere in the group. Everyone thinks about each other, consults, thinks and acts. We conducted a lot of research last year, in the fire brigade, healthcare, you name it. Our MPs are all frequently seen in the news. I have a good feeling about it.' October 2010: 'In [the Hague neighborhood] the Forgotten Triangle we came across 492 homes with overdue maintenance, mold and leaks, sagging floors and ceilings, crumbling balconies, cracks and holes in the walls, mice and other vermin. An action committee has been set up together with the residents and the campaign '¬Ω house = ¬Ω rent' has been started,"" said Hague SP campaigner Hannie van der Sman in the Tribune. December 2011: Van der Sman looks back on a successful campaign: 'After years of waiting, housing association Haag Wonen has finally decided to demolish the houses. After a big battle between Haag Wonen, the residents and the SP, everything is now going in harmony. The residents have received a significant rent reduction. The housing association made home visits everywhere and cleaned up all dangerous situations. Residents will receive a declaration of urgency and relocation compensation, even though the homes will not be demolished until 2014 and 2017. And so that the Forgotten Triangle remains liveable until then, a social management plan has been drawn up. The neighborhood influences the temporary occupancy of vacant homes. To help people move, the SP has opened an Emergency Service in the Forgotten Triangle with the support of Haag Wonen from September. This month, residents will celebrate the victory with a neighborhood party. They are an example for The Hague of what you can achieve if you work together.' March 2011: 'This just doesn't make sense at all.' Osse SP councilor Paul Peters wasted no time in the Tribune. At the very last minute, Merck, the American parent company of MSD/Organon, had blocked the takeover of the company for reasons that were unclear to many. That controversial decision came after months of actions and negotiations. After new resistance, lawsuits and demonstrations, the cards turned out differently again: in the summer it was announced that MSD/Organon, with the support of the national government, the province and the municipality, can make a new start in the form of a Life Sciences Park in Oss. December 2011: 'The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsaving some employment through this restart is fine,' says Paul Peters now. 'But there are still a number of uncertain factors, such as the precise amounts of public money that will be involved. It is also still unclear the number of jobs that the Life Sciences Park will eventually provide. What you can say is that all the actions we have taken together with the trade unions, Organon staff and numerous politicians have contributed to at least part of the research and development activities being retained for Oss. So the resistance has not been in vain.' ‚Ä∫ What kind of year will 2012 be? 'That will be an important year on several fronts. 2012 is the year of truth for the euro. The question is how long the cabinet will remain in office. I don't make predictions, but when you see what the government is doing, I hope it will be over soon.' ‚Ä∫ Is that wise, political unrest in such economically turbulent times? 'Who's talking about unrest? Quick elections, quick change of government and let's get to work. It's not a game. There really is a big problem in Europe. A number of countries have little or no success. Worst of all, this crisis is being abused to implement right-wing political wish lists. The harsh cuts in the Netherlands are an example of this. Everyone with sense says that's bad for the economy, but they do it anyway. The crisis is also being abused to shift more power to Europe. While a lack of democracy is actually one of the problems. If we transfer our national sovereignty, for example by transferring our budgetary power to Brussels, this will affect our constitution. Everything is said and done to make it seem like a minor technical intervention, but it is not. You have to put such a big change to the people in a referendum.' ‚Ä∫ If 2012 is the year in which the change starts, are we ready for it? 'The party is in good shape. We are in a good starting position, but there is work to be done. We must use the coming year to make our party great. We do this by presenting our alternatives much more clearly, but also by standing by their side in these difficult times for people. If there was ever a time when it is good that the SP is there, it is now.' www.emileroemer.nl March 2011: Cherif Osman talks in the Tribune about his involvement in the April 6 movement that started the Egyptian revolution. has. At that time, Mubarak had just been deposed and Egypt was hopefully preparing for elections. Osman: 'The Egyptian people will only convert the freedom they have won into real democracy if they remain actively involved.' December 2011: The power of the army is still so great that Tahrir Square is already filled; people demand that the army relinquish its power. Cherif Osman and his friends in the April 6 Movement are still hopeful and active: 'These are the first steps towards real democracy. The Netherlands did not have a full-fledged democracy and the rule of law in just one year. The Egyptians removed the symbol of the old regime, but not all the political structures associated with it. The army is one of them. The elections are likely to result in major gains for the Muslim Brotherhood. They were oppressed by the old regime, can now play out their role as victims and receive a lot of money from Saudi Arabia ‚Äì 160 million euros.

182457.0," Europe is at a crossroads. On March 25, Rome commemorates the 60th anniversary of the founding of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same city. In the run-up to March 25, Commission President Juncker presented five scenarios for the future of the European Union. Strangely enough, it appears that further Europeanization is still seen as a serious possibility.¬†At this crossroads in European history, the SGP opts for a realistic alternative. We have to take action. 'Rome 2017' is a crucial moment to critically reflect on European integration since 'Rome 1957'. It is precisely now that we must conclude that European integration has gone too far. That too many countries were added. That member states lost too much independence. That the tension within the EU has become too great.¬†The SGP's alternative: a simpler and more flexible EU. More power must remain with the Member States. Greece or Poland do not need to interfere with our schools or pensions. Our Constitution must ensure that power does not disappear too easily to Europe. Moreover, we must recognize that the current euro has had its day, because the differences between north and south are too great. In the long term, a different currency is healthier for economically stable countries. A reformed EU: the SGP stands for it.

161551.0,"'Their struggle, our struggle, international solidarity!' The Netherlands has had multinationals within its borders for a long time. Multinationals compete with each other, but at the same time often know how to work well together when it comes to limiting the rights of their workers. Unions are cautiously setting up new ones. steps to ensure that international solidarity is not left solely to capital. Text: Tuur Elzinga, SP Member of the First Chamber and policy advisor for FNV Mondiaal In April 2006, Prime Minister Balkenende mentioned for the first time1 his infamous longing for a return to a VOC mentality. Balkenende was critical. , because with the VOC mentality, the Dutch plundered their colonies. The Dutch East India Company was the first Dutch multinational, complete with contemporary proportions. Around 1650, a sailor 'earned' approximately 100 guilders per year, the governor of East Java 100,000 guilders and the Governor General 2.5 million. The VOC was the first company to be financed with share capital. The company was therefore one of the founders of the later shareholder capitalism and with its worldwide exploitation not only brought prosperity to the Netherlands, but also new risks. Since the VOC, the Dutch economy has become increasingly dependent on the world economy and the 'real' economy - in the Netherlands, but also globally - increasingly dependent on financial capital. It is precisely the spread of the VOC mentality - which we now often refer to as neoliberal globalization - is one of the root causes of the financial crisis. The demise of the VOC is also clearly comparable to the current crisis: the company's accounting was extremely opaque and the - meagerly paid - employees created their own bonuses by to take some private trade on board. Despite state support, the VOC went bankrupt at the end of the eighteenth century. After the bankruptcy, the VOC stood for ‚ÄúPerished Under Corruption‚Äù2 and the company's debts were nationalized. Two centuries of profits were in the pockets of directors and shareholders disappeared. Rise of multinationals There are of course major differences between the world of then and 'our' world at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The economy was predominantly small-scale and locally oriented. The VOC was initially the only large multinational company. Around In 1800, several multinationals emerged worldwide and 100 years later there were many, some of which were very large and dominant. For example, in 1899 the United Fruit Company controlled 90 percent of all banana imports in the US. Yet even at the beginning of the twentieth century there were only a few real giants (with a total capital of $500 million or more). By 1970 the world already had 333 such giants (out of a total of 7,000 multinationals). After that, developments really took off. fast: in the mid-1990s, according to UNCTAD3, there were 40,000 multinationals with control over 250,000 subsidiaries. And at the beginning of this century the counter already stood at 60,000 with 800,000 subsidiaries. Concentration of power The rise of the multinational company has resulted in a great deal of production, capital and thus concentrates power in a small number of hands. The 100 largest multinational corporations own or control at least a quarter of the world's assets. They account for a third of all direct foreign investment from the home countries of these corporations. In the 1990s, A third of world trade already takes place within multinationals (i.e. from subsidiary to parent company or vice versa) and another third between multinationals. And the share of intra-group trade continues to grow. The largest multinationals are themselves economies that are can measure size against the economies of countries. For example, Shell's annual turnover is comparable to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Egypt and Wal-Mart's turnover is comparable to the GDP of South Africa. And the combined turnover of the seven largest transnational corporations is easily larger than the combined GDP of all African countries together. Current globalization has the multinational as the dominant player in almost all markets in the world, with many sectors dominated by a few companies (oligopoly). For example, 35 percent of the global chemicals market is shared by the five largest companies in the sector, just like more than 40 percent of the world oil market. In electronics and steel, the five largest companies control more than 50 percent. And the five largest car manufacturers even share 60 percent of the market. If such a major player withdraws from a country, then that has major consequences for the domestic economy and employment. Just the threat of this makes an impression. Many of the neoliberal policies that have made the world unsafe are therefore under direct pressure from multinationals or under pressure from rules of institutions devised by those companies as the WTO, IMF, World Bank, and OECD. These concerns are known for often allocating enormous sums of money to shape the playing field on which they operate: consumers can be influenced through advertising and other PR; politics through lobbies; through an expensive lawyer and patience, not only policymakers but also the competition; science through contracts and education through sponsorship, etc. All so that at the end of the day, through cost reduction, they can pocket even greater profits.4 Exploitation 2.0 The result once again ties in nicely with the parable of the VOC: a world based on exploitation. While capitalist exploitation was still simple at the beginning of the industrial revolution and the mechanisms of exploitation are now considerably more complex, the principle has not changed. Still loot is in control - in this case an anonymous, collective shareholder - through the ( top) management excludes the worker. But increasingly these workers work far away, out of sight of the consumer. In addition to the dynamics of the capitalist system, there is the institutional exploitation of the South by the North. The rich countries have for years an agreement on the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) that they give to poor countries. And although the Netherlands is one of the few countries that meets the 0.7 percent of GDP agreed in the UN in 1970, this is standard is under pressure here. However, the discussion about this standard is a bogus discussion if you know that the flow of money from the south to the north is much greater than the other way around. Development sociologist Lou Keune rightly calls this phenomenon reverse development aid. This is partly due to debt repayments and interest payments on debts (with the IMF, World Bank and other banks), while generally much more has already been paid off than has ever been incurred in debts. Various Western countries5 also actively participate in the legal avoidance of tax payments in production countries by 'their' multinationals6. But the largest exploitation takes place directly in the production chain. Every link in the chain wants to at least break even or make a profit, so a bit of exploitation takes place at every link. But the end result is impressive! A pair of luxury sports shoes can easily cost 90 euros. Of course, the store salesperson gets a wage and the store has to pay rent and do some advertising. Transport also costs money. And the brand must always continue to invest in nicer, better, faster shoes, so a lot of money is invested in research and development. But because the production of that pair of shoes in the production countries does not cost more than 34 cents, there is still a nice profit margin of 10 to 15 euros (11 to 17 percent). That profit is after spending one and a half to two billion ( !) dollars for advertising by companies such as Adidas and Nike. Similar calculations can be made for products such as jeans, electronics and coffee. The fact that these shoes are produced so cheaply is mainly due to the extremely low labor costs. The workers who produce the shoes in Indonesia or China receive an average of 20 to 25 cents per hour. They work approximately 10 to 12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week. In general, the employees cannot fight this: fundamental Trade union rights, such as the right to associate in a trade union or the right to collective bargaining, are not recognized in many countries. And in countries where these rights formally exist, they are not always respected. Trade unions as a counterforce The multinational company has been The Second World War was on a steady rise, but in the first decades capital was still mainly focused on national markets. National cartels of oligopoly capitalists had to absorb the worst shocks that occurred before the war. And the state had to help them with nationally driven economic policy. In that context, strong national trade unions could exercise great influence. In states with developed democracies, it proved possible to regulate and limit the exploitation of workers. Although the primary income distribution often did not deviate much internationally, in various countries, more equality has been achieved in the secondary and tertiary income distribution7. Since international capital has become increasingly dominant due to economies of scale since the 1970s and 1980s, income and wealth distribution has become more skewed almost everywhere. And we are not just talking about extremes such as Eastern Europe, the former Soviet states and China, but very emphatically also most Western European countries. The internationalization of capital has seriously undermined the position of the trade unions since the 1970s. Yet the only effective answer to the perverse production relations and increasingly unequal distribution still lies in the formation of trade unions that represent the collective interests of the workers. That the factor labor must also organize itself transnationally in the face of limitless capital is not a new insight. After all, Marx and Engels wrote in 1848: ‚ÄúWorkers of all countries unite!‚Äù And that's what they tried. Marx himself stood at the cradle of the First International. This organization did not last long. However, from 1889 onwards various international professional secretariats were established, from shoemakers to tobacco workers. On the eve of the First There were 33 during the World War. There were more and more of them, and they often merged into broader sectoral associations, which were called Global Union Federations (GUFs) from 2002 onwards. One of the first GUFs was founded in 1896. After a strike in the port of Rotterdam the strikers appealed to the solidarity of their European colleagues. The establishment of the ITF (International Transport Workers' Federation) was a direct result. The transport sector is therefore eminently internationally organized and even today the ITF is still a leader in many respects The metal workers were there even earlier, because the IMF (International Metalworkers Federation) was founded in 1893. Nowadays, almost all economic sectors fall under the field of one of the eleven GUFs. Although the name 'global union federation' indicates a global orientation, the focus of the national sectoral associations that form their supporters is in the vast majority of cases still 90 percent or more nationally oriented. And yet capital has long been accustomed to thinking beyond borders. Just after the First World War ( in 1919) the ILO, the International Labor Organization, was also founded. The purpose of the ILO is to promote internationally recognized labor standards8, including the right to organize and to collective action and bargaining. However, the ILO is unable to sufficiently counter the pressure exerted by globalization and the increasing dominance of multinationals on the rights of workers. Although numerous treaties have been concluded, too many countries have not yet signed the most important ones. Trade union rights are now increasingly under pressure. In many countries the degree of organization is declining, partly because labor is becoming increasingly flexible. more people have to rely on informal work, to which the often wafer-thin social arrangements do not apply. And just like workers, in our globalized world the unions that have to stand up for their interests are increasingly being played off against each other. Taking international action also helps We However, they are only played off against each other as long as we allow ourselves to be played out. Even in a world in which capital is completely internationalized, the labor factor can still make a difference. Provided the trade union movement organizes itself strongly internationally. The example of the GUF of the food industry proves that you can indeed row against the current. Like so many other sectors, the food sector is dominated by a few large multinational players. Nestl√© and Unilever are by far the largest global groups in this market, of which they together control 40 to 45 percent. In Asia Unilever enjoys a dubious reputation: the trend of increasing outsourcing to subcontractors and flex workers is called Unileverization here. Unilever is a trendsetter in this: of 300,000 permanent employees in 2000, only half are now employed by Unilever. Meanwhile, the number of modern employees in the Unilever chain has increased. day laborers increased to half a million. Permanent employees usually receive better pay and more favorable employment conditions than average, but piece workers, day laborers and other flexible workers often receive less than the official minimum, no money in the event of illness or no work, no vacation or pension, no right to become a trade union member... In Khanewal, Pakistan, there is a Lipton tea factory of Unilever. Until recently, 22 permanent employees were employed there and 723 workers on a daily wage basis, sometimes for more than 20 years, day in and day out. , day after day. When they wanted to organize themselves, Unilever refused to recognize them. When two employees ended up empty-handed on the street after thirty years of loyal service, it was time for action. IUF sounded the alarm, after which - in addition to ongoing actions in Pakistan itself, spreading to neighboring (and tea) country India - a broad international campaign was launched. FNV Bondgenoot and FNV Mondiaal targeted the Unilever shareholders' meeting in Rotterdam, Unite and the TUC protested in England. Unilever- workers in various factories in Latin America and Africa declared their solidarity. Campaigns were launched aimed at consumers. There were card actions against international group management and a formal complaint was filed with the OECD. The actions were a resounding success: Unilever chose eggs for money. Although Unilever decided in 1972 that employment conditions were purely a matter for national management, Unilever now sat down with an international trade union organization for the first time to resolve a conflict at international level. The result: permanent contracts for 200 flex workers from the Lipton factory in Khanewal and better payment conditions for the other flex workers, including social insurance and pension. The importance of this breakthrough goes far beyond the factory gates of the Khanewal factory: it is the first time that Unilever takes responsibility for flex workers in a production country and for the first time that they have been forced into an international social dialogue. The big lesson is that international organization pays. National unions should not be intimidated when multinationals put pressure on working conditions. They must organize themselves. And if necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãorganize internationally.

171361.0," In politics, a battle sometimes takes a long time and the subject is complicated. Something like that usually doesn't get much press. Yet it is good to talk about it, so that people see that politics is more than what appears on television. The real political craft.        For some time now, Tata Steel in IJmuiden, with 9,000 employees and 7 million tons of steel per year, has been affected by the import of Chinese steel. China produces more than half of the world's steel, but their domestic demand is stagnant. So there is overcapacity. At the beginning of this year, China therefore started exporting more and more steel to the EU, causing the price to drop by more than 40%. China also started dumping large quantities of steel below cost price with government financial support. The European steel industry, including Tata's blast furnaces in IJmuiden, therefore encountered major problems. Overcapacity and undercapacity are major problems in the raw materials trade and certainly in the steel trade where special agreements on import tariffs have been made. The European Commission therefore wanted to take much harder action against countries that dump their surplus products on the European market and stimulate this with subsidies. Almost all steel-producing European countries have therefore been advocating for higher punitive levies for years. Other countries, such as the US, where China also dumps large quantities of steel, impose high punitive levies of more than 200% to protect their own steel industry. The EU also has such a mechanism, but Brussels has imposed one additional requirement on itself in the past: the penalty may not be higher than what is strictly necessary to remove the negative effect. That has the 'lesser duty rule'. The additional tariff levy in Europe is therefore less than 20%. More than ten times lower than in the US. As a result, all the dumped Chinese steel is now coming to Europe. Employment in the European steel industry is therefore under pressure. And while the blast furnaces in IJmuiden are among the most modern, cleanest and energy-efficient steel factories in the world! It is better to buy IJmuiden's steel than Chinese steel. Last April, together with colleague Fred Teeven of the VVD, I therefore submitted a motion in which we requested the government to urgently find out whether the lesser duty rule would be applicable in special circumstances. can be put into operation. On April 28, the Bruins/Teeven motion was adopted and the government got to work. On May 23, the government informed Parliament how it would conduct this investigation. On June 24, Minister Ploumen reported on the result of the research: no, the lesser duty rule may not be inactivated within the European Union! Meanwhile, it was creaking and squeaking in IJmuiden and hundreds of jobs were at risk. What Minister Ploumen did not mention at that time was that in 2013 the European Commission had already put a proposal on the table to allow the 'lesser' to be used in special circumstances. duty rule' to deviate. However, for years there has been a group of member states, a blocking minority, that does not want to accept this, because it would restrict free trade too much. What turned out? The Netherlands belongs to that group of blocking countries! Our own government wanted to be strict, at the expense of our own steel industry in IJmuiden. Then there's steam coming out of your ears, right? But soon no longer from the chimneys of our own blast furnaces... On September 28, colleague Gesthuizen (SP) and I therefore submitted a motion during a debate on the Competitiveness Council, in which we called on the Dutch government to argue for very soon adjustment of the trade defense instruments so that the possibility would be created not to apply the lesser duty rule if the survival of the raw materials and manufacturing industry would be threatened by dumping or other forms of unfair competition. However, the votes showed that there was not a majority in the House of Representatives for this motion, and that is why we postponed this motion at the last minute. A vote in which this motion would be rejected could further damage the chances for IJmuiden. After much discussion with colleagues and studying the possibilities within Brussels regulations, we managed to get the VVD and the CDA behind our motion, if we would adjust the text slightly. On November 8, we submitted a motion Gesthuizen/Bruins/Teeven/Mulder (SP/ChristenUnie/VVD/CDA) in which we requested the government (in the person of Minister Ploumen) to actively participate during the upcoming Foreign Trade Council. call for a rapid reform of the trade defense system, including an adjustment of the lesser duty rule in the event of structural market disruption in the field of raw materials or large overcapacity. This motion received a majority on the same day. I was therefore particularly happy when I read the message in the Financial Times the following Friday: ""EU set to impose punitive anti-dumping tariffs on imports, collapse of UK-led blocking group puts Chinese steal in Brussels' sights"". According to the report in the Financial Times, the bloc of countries that want to strictly enforce the lesser duty rule has collapsed because the Netherlands and Austria indicated that they would now support the EU proposal not to apply the lesser duty rule in special cases. the blocking minority no longer has enough votes to block. Thanks to the more flexible attitude of the Dutch government, enforced by our adopted motion, the EU can pursue a more assertive industrial policy that will finally bring our blast furnaces back into a fairer market - and therefore hopefully calmer waters. We will never know how many jobs this will create. saved. We also do not know whether damage may appear to have been done in the long term.

185387.0," In Monday's ""Rzeczpospolita"", its editor-in-chief Pawe≈Ç Lisicki responded to my interview, which was published on Friday on the website www.pis.org.pl as a polemic with his text from August 5, titled ""The Polish road to Zapaterism"". Unfortunately, Mr. Lisicki was not willing to take my arguments into account and maintained his opinions from the first article in the next one. Since his judgments concern matters of great importance, I felt compelled to reach for my pen once again. A few words about invective. I would very much like Polish public life to take place at a level where defining someone's view with the word ""bullshit"" - and this word refers to views, to a thesis, and not to the person of its author - could be treated as an invective. Unfortunately this is not the case. First of all. Secondly, even if we add the adjective ""disgusting"" to the word ""nonsense"", that is, we classify someone's view as radically contrary to the truth, we are still not dealing with invective. If Mr. Lisicki perceives it differently, it means that we live in different worlds. Nevertheless, I advise him to read at least the article written by Mr. Niesiolowski about me in the last issue of ""Wprost"". This is, of course, not the only text in which I or Law and Justice are brutally and ruthlessly attacked. I could give many similar examples. Once again, I would be very happy if the Polish public debate took place in a different atmosphere. As for my participation in it, I never lowered myself to the level of Mr. Niesiolowski, nor did I even come close to it. This does not mean that sometimes I did not have to adapt a little to the prevailing tone. I also did not notice that Mr. Lisicki did much to oppose this language of aggression, to clearly and radically distance himself from the Civic Platform. To clearly state that this is a party that cannot be supported because it destroys Polish public life. If he does this, he will have greater rights to criticize. I would also like to clarify a certain misunderstanding that resulted from my reading of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"". Well, in the Gospel according to St. In Matthew we find these words: ‚ÄúLet your saying be, Yes, yes; no no. And what is more comes from the evil one‚Äù (Mt 5:37). I was thinking about this inability to follow the rules. I stuck to my tongue, now I know more, but Mr. Lisicki is exaggerating if he thinks that I interfered so much in his personal life. The rule ""yes, yes, no, no"" definitely applies to Catholics and I have some doubts whether Mr. Lisicki actually adheres to it. And yet opportunism. I am also not sure whether Mr. Lisicki even read the statement of the Law and Justice Political Committee of August 2 . Let me remind you: we did not put up the cross, we did not create the group that stands around the cross and if there are PiS members in it, they are few and they appear there as private individuals. Therefore, under no circumstances can the action to defend the cross be considered our work. Attributing this to Law and Justice is simply an abuse, although of course we believe that the cross in this place is absolutely appropriate. Our message talks about the tradition of the Polish cross, its various contexts, and that President Komorowski should know these contexts. Since Mr. Lisicki did not quote even a fragment of this otherwise not very long text, neither in one nor in his second speech, I am forced to treat it as a certain abuse, because this text does not provide the slightest basis for the claims contained in his articles. In our message, we accept, among other things, the transfer of the cross by pilgrims to Czestochowa, but at the same time we postulate that it be returned to its current place from there. The question still remains open to me why I was compared with Mr. Komorowski, the real creator of pre-Paterism in Poland. Because his statement gave rise to various types of attacks, to various types of actions that show the compromising face of Warsaw, and no one who sees this face should forget that the Civic Platform completely wins the elections in prisons. Mr. Lisicki should not forget this either. I do not intend to identify this face with the Civic Platform, but the fact I mentioned above is beyond doubt. To put it briefly: Zapaterism is indeed emerging in Poland, but its supporters, enemies of the cross, were emboldened by the statement of the incumbent president of the Republic of Poland. It was he who gave the signal that crosses can be removed from public space. I only opposed it, like many publicists and journalists, including those who criticize me on a daily basis. One of them, a certain Kontek, juxtaposes me in Tuesday's ""Fakt"" with Komorowski and his friend and prot√©g√© Palikot. This is what a ""political need for balance"" turning into a delusion can lead to. I like animals and I don't hide it. So, according to this way of thinking, I am probably responsible for the ""hunting"" instincts of the current president, who clearly takes pleasure in killing innocent animals during the hunt. Also, Palikot's exploits are certainly the result of my criticism of them. I repeat: you cannot - as Mr. Lisicki wants - accuse those who oppose evil of causing it. The current president won the election because he received the support of a significant part of the conservative electorate, which is certainly not against the cross - that's why I talked about it in the interview as a misunderstanding. These are facts that cannot be ignored. Facts that allow me to talk about Mr. Lisicki's opportunism or hyper-opportunism. I can support my claim with another example from Monday's ""Rzeczpospolita"". Well, she mentions my press conference, even writing about it quite moderately. However, when I report what I said about Mr. Komorowski's statements, I quote only one of them, from the times when he was not yet Marshal of the Sejm - that ""it is a pity for Poland"". However, there is no mention of the statements I mentioned: ""what visit, what attack"" or ""a blind sniper would miss from 30 meters."" Not to mention this mysterious statement that the president will fly somewhere and - presumably - not return, which I said should be the subject of an investigation. I also see an element of opportunism in their omission, because these are words that greatly discredit the president. I also consider it worth quoting in a serious newspaper my statement that if such a situation as what happened to Lech Kaczy≈Ñski in Georgia happened to the president of France and was commented on by the president of the local National Assembly with similar sentences, the latter would have to disappear very quickly. political sceneThe cross is not a symbol of an attack. Mr. Lisicki does not want to withdraw from the thesis that Law and Justice sees the cross as a symbol of an attack. He ignores my argument that the fact that there are crosses on graves does not mean that the vast majority of these graves contain people who were murdered or died in any dramatic circumstances. However, he writes that since I say that rejecting the attack in advance - which, I would add, even the prosecutor's office does not do - is an expression of cowardice, then searching for evidence of the attack is an expression of courage. Maybe so, but is courage really a bad trait in this kind of situations? I am deeply convinced that any normal country, whose president and many other outstanding personalities would die in this kind of catastrophe, would do everything to participate in the Russian investigation. I would like to emphasize very strongly that during the election campaign I said this clearly many times and I was one of the initiators of the appropriate resolution on this matter, which was rejected by the majority of the Sejm. Moreover, the desideratum of the Sejm Justice Committee submitted by Law and Justice was not accepted, which confirms the government's reluctance to even limited Polish participation in the investigation. All this taken together must raise far-reaching doubts about the good conscience of those who do it. I have the right to talk about moral and political responsibility. And finally, the last point. Mr. Lisicki creates the following opposition: either the Smolensk disaster was a coincidence, and then no one is responsible for it, or we were dealing with an attack for which the attackers are responsible. Thus, the editor-in-chief of ""Rzeczpospolita"" forgets that there is a somewhat indirect sphere: the sphere of moral and political responsibility. Moreover, contrary to what Mr. the government's constant violation of the constitution and ordinary laws, to which, unfortunately, the media did not respond appropriately, and the Katyn game between Donald Tusk and Vladimir Putin, which was directed against the president of his own country, obviously lowered the president's security and increased the likelihood of a catastrophe. Therefore, there are reasons to talk about the moral and political responsibility of some politicians of the ruling party, who in a normally functioning democracy would have to resign from politics. Mr. Lisicki does not want to acknowledge all this, because perhaps it is too dangerous for his current status; perhaps he feels that it would also undermine his self-esteem; maybe there are some other reasons. However, my task is not to support Mr. Lisicki's well-being. To close this polemic, I would like to make it clear that I will handle the Smolensk disaster case within the social movement, not within the party. No one can accuse me of ever saying that I would not do it, although in fact I did not emphasize it during the election campaign. But I have said more than once that the Polish-Polish war led to a tragedy, that boys played with matches. At the same time, as I have already mentioned, I voted for a more decisive attitude of the government regarding the investigation. I was in favor of it being carried out until the end, both in terms of moral and political responsibility, and at the level of explaining the real causes of the disaster. Based on the knowledge we have today, one thing seems to be beyond doubt: the crew of this plane was misled.

199540.0," The first theory explaining the attitude of ""Wyborcza"" is that it supports with all its strength and determination the Polish government, which is trying to be the best US ally in Europe. For years, I have been of the opinion that ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" is a thrifty environment, right? morally unstable, and unimaginably impudent. These ""attributes"" have been revealed with exceptional sharpness in recent days. The GW editorial office was thrown into a frenzy - twice at once - by the Democratic Left Alliance, which demanded the Sejm's position on the increasing manifestations of nationalism sanctioned by the state authorities in Ukraine and submitted a draft bill on financial compensation for the victims of the ""Balcerowicz plan"". Of course, the heavy artillery of the newspapers primarily targeted Leszek Miller.¬†Gazeta's attitude towards Russia, Ukraine and the events in Ukraine is unconditionally anti-Russian. It is enough that anyone whose influence on Russian society is the same as the influence of ""Wyborcza's"" columnist on the political attitudes of Eskimos, announces that he is Putin's enemy in ""Gazeta ‚Äù immediately becomes a hero of the fight to free Russia from Putin's pet tyranny.¬†For ""Gazeta"", Russia is by definition evil, Ukraine only good. Russia threatens Poland every hour, or even every minute, while Ukraine, on the contrary, loves us sincerely and does not want anything from us. Russian crimes against Poles are condemned with the uncompromising uncompromising nature they deserve, but even the wildest crimes committed against our compatriots by Ukrainians are stubbornly relativized. Another feature characterizing the attitude of the ""GW"" editorial team towards the events in Ukraine is the stigmatization of Russia as the only one responsible. for what it has come to. It may very well be that this is what is necessary, but the matter is by no means clear-cut. There are many publicists and politicians in the West who point to the responsibility of the US and the European Union. It is worth talking about this before adopting such a clear stance. Also about the reasons for the events in eastern Ukraine - did the Russians want to Russify the Ukrainians, or maybe the other way around - the Ukrainians wanted to ""Ukrainize"" the Russians? Did the Russians say that they would like to pick up the ""kalakh"" and kill all the Ukrainians, or maybe Mrs. Tymoshenko wanted to get rid of the Russians this way? Were the Russians pushing to Norfolk, or maybe (using the Ukrainians) the Americans to Sevastopol?¬†""Gazeta"" does not ask such questions and requires this attitude from everyone - let's close our eyes, let's not return to the painful past, because we must understand that for Ukrainians, the war fought by Bandera is their national myth.¬†Well, ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" differs from society in that it is ready for it, we are not. Maybe one day we will be there, but certainly not in the shadow of Bandera's monuments. In our ears, a minute of silence in honor of Shukhewycz sounds like a bell of fear.¬†The application for state honors for Petr Dyachenko is like spitting in the face of the Warsaw insurgents from Czerniak√≥w and the soldiers of the 1st Polish Army who tried to come to their aid. There is no consent to this - whether ""Gazeta"" likes it or not. And if you don't like it, it's obvious. The question is why? What happened that the editor-in-chief, who appeared at one of the balls at the beginning of ""Gazeta"" in the uniform of a Russian general, which was a joke on Russia, but a nice one, now writes and tells me to write about Russia only with an ax? I have come across two theories on this subject. Interestingly, none of them takes seriously Gazeta's assurances that it is only about defending democracy, Ukraine's right to decide its own fate, and about supporting good in the fight against evil. Nobody believes this. In the past, ""Gazeta"" has used too many big words - even the size of the Chinese Wall - for its small interests, so maybe that's why the words ""morality"", ""truth"" and ""selflessness"" are not among the ones used to describe it.¬†The first theory explaining the attitude of ""Wyborcza"" is that it supports with all its strength and determination the Polish government, which is trying to be the best US ally in Europe. She calls it the Polish raison d'√©tat, and the Polish raison d'√©tat is the highest value for her... Maybe - whoever wants, let him believe. In any case, such a reason of state that makes Russia the first enemy of Poland and Poland the first enemy of Russia is certainly not in our interest.¬†Even if the US adopted us as the 51st state. Our raison d'√©tat is the deepest possible integration with the European Union and good relations with our neighbors. The second theory says (although I do not believe in it) that the anti-Russian line of the magazine is the personal revenge of the editor-in-chief against the president of Russia. It apparently happened that during one of the meetings with Vladimir Putin as part of the so-called ""Waldaski Club"", editor Michnik was treated casually by the President of Russia, although he shouldn't have been - after all, he demanded the release of the ""conscience of Russia"", Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was imprisoned for politics or for thievery - I don't remember. In any case, Michnik later compared Khodorkovsky to Mandela, and Putin, who actually released him ahead of schedule, treated him like a criminal who asked for a pardon. It is clear that these two theories answer the question about ""zoological"" anti-Russianism and ""blind love"" of Ukrainian ""GW"" in a far incomplete way. In any case, Miller must have irritated some extremely painful nerve of ""Wyborcza"" to kick him so brutally. It is true that its publicists have never hesitated to attack their opponents only with epithets, but calling Miller an ""agent of Russia's ideological influence in Poland"" crosses all boundaries. I wonder how the ""Wyborcza"" team would feel if they started saying that it is an ""organ of the Bandera party"" in Poland?¬†It is much easier to understand the second reason for Gazeta's fury against Miller. This is a draft law on compensation for victims of the ""Balcerowicz plan"". It appeared when the right-wing majority passed an act on financial assistance for oppositionists active in the Polish People's Republic.¬†This is another bill issued to Poland by the people of ""Solidarity"". ""Gazeta"" was at the forefront of those outraged by Miller's ""impudence"" and was the first to call him ""former members of the Politburo"" and apparatchiks who took advantage of privileges in the 1980s.¬†You have to have some nerve! After all, before Poland in the 1980s faced a dramatic failure of its economic system, it was the final stage of a 45-year history whose pages were written not only by Miller.¬†When Stalinist comrades were pouring concrete for the building of their power, Miller was flying around with his shirt in his teeth. It was not he and his mother who took advantage of the privilege of living in beautiful apartments on Belwederska, Pulawska and Wiejska streets, his mother did not send him to school with Russian lectures, it was not he who worked hand in hand to turn Polish scouts into pioneers, but Poland on the small Soviet Union.¬†He also had nothing to say in the 1960s, when heavy industry was still being expanded and the increase in food prices was compensated by lower locomotive prices.¬†""Familia"" of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"", however, could really moderate itself a little, because it is not in Miller's closet that the skeletons are clanking. Socialist economics promoted a low level of employment - everyone earned little, generally lived equally modestly, in return for which, the state guaranteed work and low prices on basic items. This worked for a long time, but eventually the system collapsed, because there is no economy in the world that is not fueled by income from the population. It is impossible to produce more expensive and sell cheaper indefinitely. We were forced into this squaring of the circle not of our own will, but by willing followers of Soviet economics. Then there were only consequences, until Leszek Balcerowicz's shock treatment. Then, as if by magic, the shops were filled with hams overnight - all they had to do was raise the price of ham by several hundred percent.¬†In 1989, almost everything changed. It seemed that all the problems of the Polish economy were already behind them. Meanwhile, Balcerowicz replaced the dogma of a planned socialist economy with another one - the recipe for healing the Polish economy is liberalism in its extreme nineteenth-century form.¬†No reasonable person will deny that Balcerowicz has undoubtedly contributed to the fact that the Polish economy has freed itself from the current lunar system. But no one will deny that the transformation had enormous consequences. Its costs could undoubtedly be much lower. Therefore, the success of the transformation is also a failure for millions of Poles. The SLD project only reminded us of this.¬†Balcerowicz's reforms also changed Poland in the sense that they paved the way for some to fabulous wealth, while pushing others to the very bottom of the social hierarchy. The state threw people who couldn't swim into the depths of the market economy and told them: cope.¬†Years later, the ""work"" of Balcerowicz and ""Solidarity"", despite the cries of ""Wyborcza"", was subjected to fundamental criticism both by economists of such stature as Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, and by outstanding economists and politicians associated with ""Solidarity"", to mention only Prof. Tadeusz Kowalik, prof. Karol Modzelewski (I wouldn't spend a minute in prison for capitalism), the charismatic Jacek Kuro≈Ñ (we screwed it up), or by the outstanding intellectual, Marcin Kr√≥l (we were stupid).¬†""Gazeta"" prefers not to remember about it. Instead, the idiot writes that no one suffered during the political transformation, because Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government treated the social needs of citizens whose workplaces were closed down with exceptional generosity.¬†For example, many people at full strength could retire early... I would like the editors to get a taste of this bullshit - somewhere in the provinces, where every day is similar to another day, in a town where you can walk from one end to another in half an hour, where life slips hopelessly through your fingers. , and there is no reason to leave.¬†Yes, those who were laid off received severance pay and could do whatever they wanted with the money... But what could a farmhand working in a PGE, a blacksmith from a PGE forge, or a seamstress who had been sewing a single stitch for half her life? Sign up for a ""business incubator"" and start your own company? The money quickly ran out and to this day whole families live by picking mushrooms, berries, seasonal work picking strawberries, and cleaning houses. There is nothing - a fantastic career, great professional development, which Mr. Balcerowicz and his company provided to hundreds of thousands of citizens. Besides, if it is so great, why do almost three million young Poles look for bread abroad?¬†So why has Wyborcza defended Balcerowicz for so many years, with such remembrance and determination? In my opinion, she owes him a debt of gratitude.¬†Ryszard Bugaj wrote and spoke about it, someone who cannot be assumed to have any ESLD sympathies, on the contrary. You can blame him for many things, but he is an idealist who sticks to his principles regardless of the circumstances.¬†He described how the elite of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" became enfranchised. Well, at the start of the venture called ""Gazeta Wyborcza"", about 100 leading figures of Agora received assets in shares worth about PLN 1 billion. Well, to have this money in your hand, you had to sell the shares.¬†You had to pay tax when selling. And at that moment, the project of changes to the Tax Act, authored by the Ministry of Finance, fell out of the sky. It was then commanded by Leszek Balcerowicz, a minister and deputy prime minister in one. The project allowed to avoid tax on income from the sale of shares previously acquired in non-public trading. In practice, a relatively small group, but including ""Gazeta"" people, could benefit from this kindness of the ministry. It was estimated then that the savings of these lucky people could reach up to PLN 600 million. zlotys. I remember a note from ""Rzeczpospolita"" about the intention to sell Agora shares by one of the leading figures of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"". If I am not mistaken, it was stated that the value of the shares in question was PLN 80 million. zlotych. Isn't this a reason to remember prof. Balcerowicz and enough motivation to jump at the throat of anyone who questions ""shock therapy"" in his defense? PS.

187312.0," see: Jaroslaw Kaczynski on the decisions of the last EU summit PiS president Jaroslaw Kaczynski said on Monday that the provisions of the draft new intergovernmental agreement on the fiscal pact put our country at risk ""in a position lower than an observer."" At the last EU summit, it was agreed, among other things, that EUR 200 billion would go to the IMF, which would allocate it to help indebted EU economies. EUR 150 billion of this amount would come from euro zone countries, and EUR 50 billion from countries outside the euro zone, including Poland. On Friday, the Polish government received the draft intergovernmental agreement on the fiscal pact, which was the topic of the summit. ""These proposals put our country in a position lower than that of an observer. We are to be informed about preparations for the new body, as I understand it - the euro zone council - as well as about decisions. Tusk said that we should be at the main table as guests, not on the menu. Well, we're on the menu. This is the proposal, there is no doubt about it,"" said Jaroslaw Kaczynski during a press conference at the party's headquarters in Warsaw. ""The question is what should we pay for,"" he added. He emphasized that his party believes that ""you should not pay and join this group - regardless of what it will look like, because it will always bring us more harm than good."" The PiS leader said that the solutions adopted at the summit mean that Poland has nothing to say. ""There is an assumption that this is a proposal prepared under the influence of Berlin and Paris, i.e. the capitals that make decisions today. The question is: why and for what purpose does Tusk strive so hard to attract the attention of this capital city, which is closer to us. Why are we dealing with such a policy towards Germany when that side is not ready to even make any courtesy gestures,"" Kaczynski said. ""It is really difficult to find examples of a similar policy when it comes to sovereign states,"" he noted. ""Are we dealing here with some kind of dependency or some other mechanism?"" Because any rational explanation of this situation only creates a big question mark,"" emphasized Jaroslaw Kaczynski. PiS MEP Ryszard Czarnecki, in turn, noted that for now we are dealing with a draft intergovernmental agreement. Therefore - as he noted - the government still has room for maneuver. According to him, the provisions of the current draft agreement relegate Poland ""to the role of a payer"".

184456.0," Anna Ambroziak: What was the reason for your resignation from the position of chairman of the PiS Parliamentary Club? Przemys≈Çaw Gosiewski: My decision to resign from this function resulted from the proposal presented to me by President Jaroslaw Kaczynski. This proposal concerned the coordination of the activities of the State Work Team.A.A.: Were you surprised by this?P.G.:¬†To tell you the truth - no. This seemed understandable to me, because I believe that my knowledge as a former deputy prime minister and coordinator of government work about the functioning of the Council of Ministers, government and parliamentary institutions predisposes me to perform such a function. Moreover, I realize that it would be difficult to combine these functions with my current position as the head of KP PiS, because the number of duties would exceed my capabilities. President Kaczy≈Ñski's decision resulted from our earlier arrangements.A.A.: Why was the decision on these changes announced yesterday?P.G.:¬†The date of their announcement is not accidental, because we are starting a new political season - it is understandable that my role will be to make the work related to party program and new bills. I would like to take up and finalize these issues as soon as possible. I believe that the new year is the best moment for this, and Epiphany Day is the most symbolic.A.A.: What priorities do you set for the State Work Team?P.G.:¬†This team was established to prepare our party to take power again, which will take place after next elections. We want to be the first party that will have drawers full of laws and will be organizationally prepared to exercise power. We intend to detail our program adopted in Krakow and create specific laws based on it.A.A.: And the most urgent of them is...?P.G.:¬†The issue we are already working on is a completely new draft of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland - the Legislative Work Team is working on it , a subordinate body of the State Work Team, which he personally heads. We are already at the finish line. This is one of the examples that the State Work Team is not only about theoretical discussions about the changes that would have to take place in Poland. This is followed by specific legal acts. Apart from the new Constitution of the Republic of Poland, we will also prepare other legal acts. We will submit them depending on specific political possibilities in the Sejm. It is certainly not in our interest to submit bills when they would be maliciously rejected by the Civic Platform. However, I can assure you that we will work on them and will have them ready when we take power.A.A.: What are these projects?P.G.:¬†Including the draft lobbying act. We also have a new act on property lustration and projects in other areas, including health and social issues. We are doing this to show that the government that will be established after the elections - and we are convinced that it will be the government of Law and Justice - will be ready for work. So that it does not turn out that history is repeating itself when the current Civic Platform government took power, when we waited for half a year for the bills to be submitted to parliament. In addition, they turned out to be consistent with those developed earlier by the PiS government. That is why it is so important for us to be properly prepared for these activities from the first day of our government. We expect that the work of the State Work Team will not be difficult - it is made up of a group of well-prepared experts. We have a strong substantive base. We want to show Poles that PiS is an alternative to PO. In Poland, there is a need for a discussion on arguments, and Law and Justice will provide them.A.A.: Grazyna Gesicka will be a good fit as the head of the PiS Parliamentary Club?P.G.:¬†I think this is the most accurate choice. Minister Gesicka managed large human resources, and besides, she is a person who will be able to initiate activities related to the economic sphere within the club as its head.

The takeover of the office, described by the media as ""velvet"", was attended by, among others: former presidents Aleksander Kwasniewski and Lech Walesa. Taking over the office of President of the Republic of Poland by the will of the Nation, I solemnly swear that I will be faithful to the provisions of the Constitution, I will steadfastly guard the dignity of the Nation, the independence and security of the State, and the good of the Homeland and the well-being of its citizens will always be my highest command - repeated Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, following the Marshal of the Sejm, Marek Jurek. , adding: ""So help me God."" In his speech, the president stated that Poland needs a reckoning with history, but also harmony and unity. According to him, the state must be cleansed and rebuilt, among other things. adoption of a new constitution. Lech Kaczynski assured that he would not be guided by loyalty to anyone other than loyalty to Poland. He announced that ""he will use all the powers granted to him by the constitution and laws to persuade those in power to introduce the necessary changes."" He assessed that a profound change in the way of exercising power is needed, and repairing the Republic of Poland is a specific task. This means removing pathological phenomena from our lives, and above all, today's great crime, especially corruption - he emphasized. He expressed his belief that Poland needs a new constitution that will eliminate governments removed from social control, reduce the risk of pathologizing the state, and eliminate irresponsibility. The adoption of a new constitution would also be the culmination of the construction of what we call the Fourth Polish Republic. Euro-Atlantic relations, relations with the United States, must be tightened in the best interests of the world and maintained in difficult moments, while clearly stating our demands, he said. He announced that he would introduce a ""new quality"" to relations with countries east of Poland. PiS president Jaroslaw Kaczynski assured that his brother's presidency would be more active than Kwasniewski's. After being sworn in, the president and his immediate family took part in a solemn mass for the homeland at the Archcathedral of St. John. The homily was delivered by the Primate of Poland, Cardinal. J√≥zef Glemp. At the Royal Castle, where the president received the insignia of power, he announced that his policy of decorations would be different from that of Kwasniewski. Then Lech Kaczy≈Ñski - for the first time as head of state - visited the Presidential Palace, where he was welcomed with bread and salt. At Pilsudski Square he took over command of the armed forces. He said that he is sure that the next generations of Poles will be able to live in peace, but no one knows the future, which is why Poland needs armed forces, armed forces operating within NATO, allied with many powerful allies, but ""at the same time, separate, ours, Polish, white and red. In a congratulatory message to Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished him much success and good luck in fulfilling his responsible duties. President Horst Koehler emphasized in a telegram that the two countries currently have close cooperation. French President Jacques Chirac extended his wishes to President Kaczy≈Ñski for success in fulfilling this noble mission entrusted to him by the nation. He invited the new president to visit Paris next year. The European Commission also congratulated the president. We are convinced that Poland will continue to play an important role in the process of European integration, said EC spokesman Johannes Laitenberger.

186243.0," The Constitutional Tribunal examines the application of the Commissioner for Human Rights sp. Janusz Kochanowski to declare unconstitutional the decrees of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic of December 12, 1981. Recognizing the unconstitutionality of the decrees would make it possible to question judgments and other decisions of the authorities issued on the basis of the provisions of martial law and to apply for compensation. The Tribunal is examining the case as a full bench, chaired by the president. TK Andrzej Rzeplinski; the rapporteur is Judge Miroslaw Granat. The Tribunal may examine legal acts no longer in force if they have consequences for fundamental human rights. When Janusz Kochanowski submitted an application to the Constitutional Tribunal in 2008, he said that the constitutionality of the martial law decrees had never been examined, which means that those wronged by the then authorities had difficult and sometimes closed ways of pursuing their rights. People who were interned then were imprisoned. or were dismissed from work, they still suffer the consequences, e.g. they have lower pensions because they cannot document their period of employment or they were unemployed at that time - argued Kochanowski. As he said, the inconsistency of the decrees with the constitution of the Polish People's Republic ""has never raised any doubts"" because the Council The state could only issue decrees between sessions of the Sejm - meanwhile such a session lasted. The decrees issued during the session could not be approved by the Sejm, which should have removed the incorrectly issued decrees from the legal order - argued the Ombudsman. Meanwhile, in January 1982, the Sejm approved the decrees of December 12. According to the Ombudsman, the decrees were also unconstitutional because they had not been properly announced. The ""Journal of Laws"" in which they were published was printed only on December 17-18. This resulted, among other things, in the fact that in the initial period of martial law, judges who ruled on matters under the decree used typescripts delivered by a messenger. The application of the decrees in relation to the period preceding their actual publication in the ""Journal of Laws"" led to the operation of the law retroactively,"" the Ombudsman emphasized. In February 1992, the Sejm adopted a resolution that the decision on martial law was illegal. In October 1996, the Sejm, with the votes of the then SLD-PSL government coalition, discontinued the proceedings against the persons responsible for its introduction and did not agree to make Wojciech Jaruzelski, Czeslaw Kiszczak or other members of the Military Council of National Salvation and the State Council answer to the State Tribunal. In April 2007, the investigative department of the Institute of National Remembrance from Katowice accused nine people - members of the authorities and the State Council - of martial law. A trial in this case has been ongoing in the District Court in Warsaw since September 2008. On the night of December 12-13, many oppositionists were detained; In total, approximately 10,000 people were interned. people. A curfew was introduced. Selected enterprises were militarized. Strikes, trade union and social activities were banned, and, among others, freedom of print and assembly. An ad hoc procedure was introduced in orchards. Oppositionists were forced to make humiliating ""declarations of loyalty"". Members of ""S"" were thrown out of work; many were forced to emigrate. The Institute of National Remembrance identified 56 fatalities during martial law. Failure to comply with the authorities' decisions was punishable by severe penalties, up to and including the death penalty. According to incomplete data, over 3.5 thousand people were arrested for opposition activities under the martial law decree. people. In the years 1981-89, common courts sentenced 1,713 people for opposition activities. On the basis of the martial law decree, military courts sentenced 5,681 people. On December 31, 1982, martial law was suspended, and on July 22, 1983, it was revoked, while maintaining the repressive legislation.

192469.0,"- If we consistently implement the planned plan and avoid major mistakes - because everyone makes them, it's just about their scale - then after 2019 we will be able to start the next stage of changing Poland. Areas that, in our reality, need not only to be modernized, but even plowed through, there is so much that in order to make Poland a modern country, free from the burden of the past and friendly to its citizens, not two but at least three terms are needed. Therefore, we are setting ourselves on a long march and this is our goal - said PiS President Jaroslaw Kaczy≈Ñski for weekly ""Gazeta Polska"". We will not discover America if we say that the dismissal of Minister Antoni Macierewicz was a huge surprise for many voters of Law and Justice. What were the reasons for the change in this position? - I cannot tell you about all the circumstances that led to these decisions. .I would like to ask you for your understanding. However, there are also some that reached the public opinion. Is it about the pressure from Mr. President? - It is no secret to anyone that they were, and very intense. There was really no other option. effective implementation of our political project, this was the right thing to do, although for none of us - I can say that especially for me - this decision was not easy. I have known Antoni for 40 years. Sometimes we cooperated, other times we acted in parallel, but we were more or less intensive contact. Unfortunately, things have now turned out so that, despite sentiment and merit, we had to act as we did. Antoni Macierewicz will be in charge of explaining the causes of the tragedy of April 10, 2010. Is finding out the truth about Smolensk still a priority for Law and Justice? - Nothing has changed and will not change in this matter. I hope that around the next anniversary of the dramatic death of the Polish delegation headed by my sp. Brother, a technical report will be presented to the public. I hope that it will be unveiled at the same time a monument to the victims of Smolensk and a built-in cornerstone in commemoration of President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. When will the monument to the President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski be built? - We predict that it will happen on November 10 this year. Just the day before the hundredth anniversary of regaining independence. However, we did not plan such a coincidence. It turned out that the process of selecting the winning design took longer than we expected, and there was also time to create the monument. The death anniversary turned out to be an unrealistic date, and the first possible date is November. Mr. President, many people perceived the nature of the reconstruction as PiS moving to the center. .Was this one of the goals of the changes made in the government? - Of course, it is always the case that we care about new voters, I guess that's understandable. However, most commentators who are already analyzing the centrist PiS will surprise that the goal of the reconstruction is not any shift to the center. This entire march to the center is a myth that operates in our journalism, at least in part of it - also the right-wing one, and which has nothing to do with reality. The divisions on the Polish political scene do not separate the center from the left on the one hand, and the right from the the second. They are much more complicated - they concern the real interests of individual groups and their ideological identification. The changes in the government had two goals: to make the process of changes in Poland more dynamic, and secondly, to win the upcoming elections. And this is the first one, i.e. local government elections. this will be an extremely difficult task, especially in large cities, but we are determined, because with local governments favorable to good change, reforming Poland, breaking up post-communist cliques and castes would be much more effective. I look at the next elections, i.e. the European ones, mainly in terms of image. A good result in them this is capital for the election campaign to the Polish Parliament. Although I must add that a large PiS representation in the European Parliament will give us some opportunities. Today, from the perspective of current polls, what has been achieved, plans for the second part of the term, do you assess the chances of independent governments after the 2019 elections? - I believe that we can once again receive a loan of trust from Poles. If we consistently implement the plan and avoid major mistakes - because everyone makes them, it's just about their scale - then after 2019 we will be able to start the next stage of changing Poland. In our reality, there are so many areas that need not only to be modernized, but even plowed over, that to make Poland a modern country, free from the burden of the past, friendly to its citizens, not two, but at least three terms are needed. Therefore, we are preparing for a long march and this is our goal. Mr. Prime Minister, the comments of some publicists after the reconstruction are as follows: its main beneficiary is Jaros≈Çaw Gowin, who strengthened his position in the government. - I do not see this strengthening. It is exactly as it was before the reconstruction. I know that there are voices that the Minister of Health and the head of the Ministry of Finance are his people, but this is not true. Yes, they worked with him, but their party connections, apart from their official relationship in the past, do not exist. Professor Szumowski is a person close to Prime Minister Morawiecki. Therefore, if anyone has strengthened his position, it is him. As for Minister Czerwinska, we simply chose her out of two candidates for this position. Her way of looking at the state's finances is ours. close, it was also important that it had already proven itself. Since we are talking about Deputy Prime Minister Gowin - he himself says in interviews that the message of the United Right will now be softened. - Please ask Jaros≈Çaw Gowin about it. The deputy prime minister says various things and has something to say. this is the law. He is our coalition partner, although in a very tight coalition because we form one parliamentary club, but he works almost independently. His political path was different than that of Zbigniew Ziobro - also a coalition partner, but closer, because he comes from our environment. Mr. Gowin has his political goals, which today are parallel to ours - he declares this, and I believe in it - but in the long run, they may be slightly different. You have to be aware of this. I assure you that I have it. Are you not afraid? that some voters from the so-called hard PiS electorate will not understand the changes in the government that have taken place and will feel a sense of disappointment and disappointment? - Of course I take this into account, which is why last month I abandoned my habit of avoiding purely political topics and I turned directly to this most faithful part of our supporters. I asked them to trust me. And I am still asking for it - trust me, ladies and gentlemen, we will not let you down, the program of profound changes in our country will not be slowed down, quite the opposite. There is no question of any coming to terms with the forces that have treated Poland as their private prey for years. We are not changing course. Perhaps sometimes we will have to take a somewhat winding path to reach our goal - this is politics, but the goal does not change and it is still the goal of our hardline electorate - radical change of the Republic of Poland. There is no fear that all new ministers fully understand this? The first statements of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could indicate that he has a problem with properly reading the tasks that have been set before him. - It is no secret that we had hoped that this ministry would another person will be in charge. Unfortunately, she withdrew from this mission almost at the last moment. From this point of view, the candidacy of Minister Czaputowicz is a certain experiment, but I believe it will be a successful one. But this experiment did not have a good start. - That's true, but I can tell you assure that everything has already been clarified. The minister did not speak precisely enough. There is, of course, no question of Poland handing over decisions on the reform of the judiciary to the Court of Justice. This is our internal competence guaranteed by European Union law, there will be no international arbitration in this matter .And the statement regarding reparations? - The first statement of the minister was misunderstood, in subsequent ones he referred to the matter more precisely and said very well - Germany has agreed to dialogue in this regard, this is a hopeful declaration on their part. Is this the government's two years? - I cannot declare to you now that this line-up will remain until the parliamentary elections. Various things can happen that we are not even thinking about today. However, I can say that I am not in favor of frequent replacement of ministers. Because, of course, the position of the Prime Minister is unquestionable. This team's task is to win the elections in 2019. It is to launch projects that will help us achieve this, and to work hard with all our strength during the election campaign. What are the priorities for the second part of the term? - First, a hard fight to build Poland's position on the international arena and resisting attempts to recolonize our country. In the social sphere, the ""Mieszkanie plus"" program is crucial - extremely important for thousands of Polish families. But people will not feel its effects before the elections. - They will not feel it in the sense that they will not see thousands of apartments , but they will see that the program has gained momentum and its finalization is only a matter of time. I count on this very much - Poles must see that this promise of ours is being dynamically implemented and that affordable own housing is a reality, not a fairy tale. The Prime Minister must break through all these non-substantive problems that slowed down the implementation of the ""Mieszkanie plus"" program in the first part of the term. There is a large social group that has not seen an improvement in its situation so far - I mean retirees. We are working intensively to significantly change the living conditions of the oldest Poles. I don't know yet what we will be able to afford, calculations are being made, but we must do so in order to allocate money for real support for our seniors. Of course, apart from these general priorities, there are strategic goals of individual ministries, which are to make changes within their own competences. It will continue the modernized Polish army, police, there will be serious changes in the health service, in the space shaping our national consciousness - museums will be created telling the true history of our country, also the history of our compatriots who remained behind the eastern border after World War II. We will also fight hard for the image of our history on the international arena. We will defend our dignity and our interests. Changes in the judiciary will continue, as they are of key importance not only for citizens' sense of justice and compliance with the law, but also for economic development. In the economic sphere, we will continue to work on tightening the tax system and investment stimulation. In this matter, it is crucial to show that we do not treat ourselves as a one-season government, that we have a program spread over years and our position on the political scene is permanent. What are your party's relations with President Andrzej Duda today? - I have I hope that they will have the character of a substantive dialogue. We are talking about many issues. Also about the presidential idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa referendum? - Yes, we are also talking about that. I have said many times that we are not enthusiasts of this idea. But at the moment the situation is such that we have an agreement. with Mr. President to try to work out the questions together. We will see what the effect of this work will be. Apart from everything, we believe that the referendum date chosen by Mr. Dude is very difficult. The centenary of independence should be a time of pride in one's own country, there is no point in disturbing it with an obligation participation in the referendum, urging people to go to the polling stations. Please remember that in Poland the tradition of participating in referendums is very, very weak. I don't think anyone wants to order a referendum and then end up like Bronislaw Komorowski with a few percent of turnout. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you an anecdote related to this event. I was going on an election campaign and I was wondering whether to go to the referendum or not. I decided to go. Before seven o'clock in the morning I showed up at my polling station and put the commission into a state of deep shock. .They gave the impression that they had seen a ghost - I was the first to vote. It would be the defeat of President Duda, not PiS. - This way of thinking is foreign to us. We want to maintain the unity of our camp at all costs, because we are deeply convinced that cohesion is a guarantee of the possibility of making decisions. profound changes. And does the President think so too? Is he determined to maintain unity? - Please ask the President. I do not want to speak on his behalf, especially on this matter. I really want the thread I have just discussed to sound good. : we are focused on maintaining unity. If we are to rule for more than one or two terms, unity is a necessary condition to achieve this goal. Another necessary element is the radical elimination of pathologies. And we will not lack determination in this matter. This is how he was perceived in this context Do you know the result of the vote in the case of Senator Stanislaw Kogut? - Very bad. The senators who did not support the prosecutor's motion acted as if they did not understand what party they were in. Their action is harmful, irrational and will certainly have an impact on both the polls and as well as strengthening the discussion on the advisability of maintaining the upper house. I would like to remind you that for many circles in Poland this is not an obvious matter. Moreover, they denied the purpose of immunity, which is not to protect a colleague, but to ensure freedom of political action. Protect deputies or senators from the revenge of some local cliques that have an impact on the courts or the prosecutor's office. The senators followed the path of misunderstood camaraderie and entered the space of very harmful corporate loyalty. Mr. President, how to effectively reach people who do not pay attention to the political scene with the PiS message through the prism of values, ideas, and who care only about their own well-being and the sense of a comfortable life? - We are not eliminating anyone. We want to establish contact and convince those who cannot be described as the patriotic, independence electorate. But this group is not a monolith. There are those who do not really care about the affairs of the state, its dignity, honor, tradition, but there are also plenty of people who have retained a certain sensitivity to these matters. We probably won't reach the first ones, but we won't get to the second ones. we can. And if you ask me about our support for business, especially smaller ones, I can say that we will work to remove the bureaucratic and official mitre from it, which in fact very often hampers the entrepreneurship of Poles. Please remember, however, that this sick system is being built has been in place for years, dismantling it also requires time. What actions do you expect from Brussels? - To be honest, we are not sure about this matter. There are experts who claim that the EU has gone too far towards Poland and will now withdraw. Others say that there is nothing to count on. We will see. Either way, we must defend our sovereignty - our dignity, but above all our interests. Especially those related to the economic development of our country. If someone thinks that there is some external center that will protect us supported our exit from the economic periphery of Europe, we are seriously mistaken. If we want to succeed and enter the center of the EU, have a GDP comparable to Germany, we must be aware that others will block us in this. And the only way to do so is achieving this goal in the foreseeable time, and not in several hundred years, is to carefully guard our own interests. Are we in any danger from the EU? - In the worst-case scenario, there will be some difficulties and inconveniences. But the optimistic scenario, according to which in fact there is no threat to us. Ladies and Gentlemen, if someone joins a new company in which everyone has already reached an agreement with each other and shares their influence, he or she must encounter resistance. This is the case in ordinary life, this is the case in international politics. Either we win a position or we won't have it. No one will give us anything for good looks or in friendly terms. The vast majority of Polish governments have been ruthlessly bowing their heads to the recommendations of the European center for years. Some, like Donald Tusk, have pursued personal interests at the expense of Poland's interests. Donald Tusk, at least since 2009 year, he only sought his promotion in the EU and subordinated his entire politics to that. In the summer of that year, he informed my sp. Brother that he would not run for president. So it must have been clear that another goal was real. We will not follow this path. .We are fighting for what we want and we will get it. There is nothing to be afraid of. Mr. Prime Minister, has Poland's position on the issue of reparations changed? - Nothing has changed in this matter. Work is ongoing at the parliamentary level, the aim of which is to collect data that will be the basis for calculating the amount claims. We will not move forward without it. The government stage will begin when the documents and calculations are completed. And if anyone thinks that this will not happen, they are deeply mistaken. I am pleased that local governments are getting involved in the estimation process, even companies with a long tradition. If you ask whether today, when negotiating with Germany, we are putting the issue of reparations on the table, I answer that we are not. It would be premature. Let's estimate the scale of losses, complete the documents and then the government will deal with it. We have signals that Germany takes this matter very seriously. Moreover, the discussion about reparations, and therefore about war damage, about who was the executioner and who was the victim, serves us very well because it goes against the narrative about the nationless Nazis and the symmetry of suffering.

184796.0," Krzysztof Grzesiowski: It starts today, but the most important thing will happen tomorrow and Sunday, especially tomorrow, Saturday - the Law and Justice congress in Pozna≈Ñ. MP Mariusz Blaszczak, good morning, MP, welcome. Mariusz Blaszczak: Good morning.K.G.: I don't know if you have read, maybe not yet, the conversation with Tadeusz Cymanski, Member of the European Parliament...M.B.: No, I haven't read it.K.G.: ...in today's daily Polska The Times. An MEP says interesting things when he looks from a distance from Brussels, for example at the Law and Justice polls. When asked what he thinks about the prospects for PiS, he says: ""Well, I still have some hopes, but I must admit that I'm worried about the public's perception of our party. Of course, the media plays a role here, but there is no doubt that this perception is influenced by the actions of individual people in the party. Agreed? M.B.: Well, a party is always created by people and it is the people who decide about the face of this party, but we also need to pay attention to the fact that it is a pity that Tadeusz Cymanski is in the European Parliament and not in the Polish Sejm, because politics in Poland is based on the Polish Parliament. MEPs are a bit on the sidelines and perhaps that's why Tadeusz Cymanski's sharpness of vision of what's going on in our country is a bit smaller in Polish politics than before. K.G.: But Tadeusz Cymanski will be at the congress, Mr. Tadeusz Cymanski? M.B.: Of course, yes. .K.G.: Maybe he will be able to say it publicly. M.B.: But definitely, Law and Justice is an open party, with unrestricted discussion, clashing views and, most importantly, views on the most important issues that are waiting to be resolved in our country, and not some sterile theatre, such as takes place in PO.K.G.: Yes, PO - are they so strong or are you so weak, looking at the polls? M.B.: It's like that, Prime Minister Tusk and his The propaganda apparatus has indeed reached a certain perfection in creating political spectacles. These primaries, which were supposed to be something interesting, turned out to be such an imperfect democracy, because there were only two candidates, pointless disputes, because after all, did these candidates, or any of them, present any vision of the development of our country? Did he tell you how to make waiting in line to see a doctor shorter? Please note that in Warsaw, to make an appointment with an endocrinologist, the next date is in November, and you have to wait three months to see a cardiologist. Did Mr. Sikorski or Mr. Komorowski say anything about this, or finally... K.G.: And will this be discussed at the congress to shorten the queues? At the PiS-M.B. congress: There will be a panel about this, there will be a panel on health care, we will present our own projects. We have such projects, we refer to the program of Professor Zbigniew Religa. It was a coherent program, it was a time when, for example, expenditure on health care increased significantly.K.G.: You said that there were only two candidates in the Platform's primaries?M.B.: Yes.K.G.: And how many candidates will there be for the president of Law and Justice? M.B.: But please note that... K.G.: So let's stick to the numbers for now, no.M.B.: Please note that we are dealing with a spectacle, because Donald Tusk has probably already decided in his heart anyway it is clearly visible who this candidate should be, it is clearly visible that Bronislaw Komorowski... K.G.: But you will admit, Mr. MP, that it is their problem, Platforma. M.B.: No, it is a problem for all of us, because instead of talking about that two million Poles are unemployed, instead of talking about the fact that our country is in debt (we hear what is happening in Greece), PLN 52 billion deficit in this year's budget - does Prime Minister Donald Tusk present us with any recipe for solving this situation ? What about pensions in the future? Debt is eating away at our pensions. Over 2 million Poles are abroad. Donald Tusk said during the 2007 election campaign that Poles would come back. Are they coming back? They don't come back. Donald Tusk tells us that working hours need to be extended so that Poles retire later. But are there jobs for these people? Over 60% of graduates are unemployed, the youngest people. K.G.: Donald Tusk will be the main figure at the Law and Justice congress, I think. M.B.: No, the main thing we want to talk about is the situation of our country and these are proposals to solve it situation. This is our fundamental task. Over 30 various thematic panels, including, for example, the Polish Presidency of the European Union and preparations for this Presidency. Do we hear how Donald Tusk's government is preparing for this? No, we don't hear that. So we present our own proposals. A year ago at the congress in Krakow, we presented a program, a very extensive program, and now we are referring to this program. K.G.: Coming back to these numbers, MP, how many candidates will there be for the position of PiS president? M.B.: Well, the number is not exaggerated here. I certainly believe that President Jaroslaw Kaczynski will be a candidate. Will there be anyone else, we'll see, it's the delegates' decision. This possibility is open.K.G.: This Saturday part, when the new president and the new authorities of Law and Justice will be elected, will be secret.M.B.: No, it will not be secret.K.G.: Journalists will be able to be in the room?M.B.: No, it's like that that we have a certain part of the meeting in which we informed the media that we want to talk among ourselves, so that this discussion would be unrestricted... K.G.: No, please do not treat it as an accusation. What I mean is that you were just talking about this unrestricted discussion... M.B.: Unrestricted discussion, so yes. K.G.: However, due to the fact that there will be no journalists in the room and so on, which can be understandable, MP Joanna Szczypinska said that secrecy was a good idea, because if it were public, someone might be afraid to express their opinion. So, unrestrained discussion or fear of revealing one's opinion? M.B.: The word is inadequate. We will talk among ourselves and this will be the part that will be devoted to the voting and discussion procedure. But at the same time, we cordially invite you, there will be organized thematic panels, very interesting, educational, for example the panel ""The future of Polish education"". Donald Tusk's government wants to provide us students with a second paid field of study... K.G.: Donald Tusk again, Mr. M.B.: But we have to refer to those in power. Who will we refer to? We indicate solutions because this is not only criticism, but these are real and specific proposals.K.G.: Can we expect any resolution, I don't know, calling, supporting, persuading Lech Kaczy≈Ñski to run in the presidential elections for a second term?M.B.: The year 2010 It's a year of presidential elections and a year of local government elections, so we will certainly refer to both elections. Of course, the natural candidate of Law and Justice in the presidential elections is Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, whose presidency we consider very active and successful. We believe that President Kaczy≈Ñski represented our country with dignity, especially in foreign policy. These are the competences of the President of the Republic of Poland according to the current Constitution. So we will definitely refer to the elections... K.G.: But in the form of a resolution? M.B.: Well, we will see in what form, it is also full freedom. We will see in what form of delegation he expresses his opinions. But we will also talk about local government elections, which are extremely important, and we will also talk about, above all, the future of our country. K.G.: Coming back to the presidency of Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, how troublesome his statement was for Law and Justice that that he expects the support of ""serious political forces"", which can be clearly understood that this support is not there yet? M.B.: Well, it is basically that I already have an election campaign, although we do not know the date of the presidential elections, and we have an election campaign due to at our political competitors, the PO, who are beating each other up so much... K.G.: Well, other candidates from other parties have also come forward. M.B.: But I think that the public's attention is drawn primarily to this brutal dispute, this war in the PO between Bronislaw Komorowski and Radoslaw Sikorski, MP Palikot joins in, Mr. Schetyna intervenes, well, a lot is happening, although it is a completely pointless dispute. Therefore... Although we do not know the date of the presidential elections, the election campaign has apparently begun. We want to take our responsibilities seriously. President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski has not yet expressed his decision or will to run for office, I am convinced that he will be... K.G.: They say that maybe in May. M.B.: I am convinced that he will be a candidate and this is what happens in mature democracies, that the final president First-termers usually run in the next elections. And I think that this will also be the case in our country.K.G.: And if not, what?M.B.: I don't think so, I don't think so, but let's wait, have a little patience.K.G.: Should such a question be asked?M.B.: Let's not argue about that , who, let's just argue about what, what his proposal will be, what needs to be changed in our country. And here Law and Justice has specific proposals. K.G.: Will there be something about space at the Law and Justice congress? M.B.: Yes, there will indeed be such a panel, there will be interesting guests, also foreign ones. The point is that, for example, in the United States, but also in the European Union, everything related to space is also the driving force of science. And we want to point out... K.T.: Oh, in this context. M.B.: Yes, yes, the opportunities that space research gives to science, Polish science. This is undoubtedly an opportunity for us. K.G.: At first, one might get the impression that the congress listeners would like to hear General Miroslaw Hermaszewski's memories from space, but I guess that is out of the question. M.B.: Well, it is that, unfortunately, this the pointless dispute in the Platform, this theater, this spectacle causes us, like the editor, to approach public and political debate with some distance. But no, we want to talk seriously. And believe me, the proposals we will submit will be very serious. K.G.: And here you fully agree with what Tadeusz Cymanski said in the interview quoted: ""There are few program discussions, conversations about ordinary, human matters."" M.B.: Of course. I completely agree with that... K.G.: ""And this problem also concerns Law and Justice"" - Tadeusz Cymanski.M.B.: I fully agree with that. But please note that when we propose a debate, a very serious debate, it is marred by such transgressions, for example by Mr. Palikot. The platform does not want to talk about the most important issues, namely pensions, health care, public finance deficit, there is no debate. And in our opinion, this is a deliberate action of those in power who are running away from difficult issues. K.G.: Congress of Law and Justice in Pozna≈Ñ from today throughout Saturday and Sunday.

K.G.: No, please do not treat it as an accusation. What I mean is that you were just talking about this unrestricted discussion... M.B.: Unrestricted discussion, so yes. K.G.: However, due to the fact that there will be no journalists in the room and so on, which can be understandable, MP Joanna Szczypinska said that secrecy was a good idea, because if it were public, someone might be afraid to express their opinion. So, unrestrained discussion or fear of revealing one's opinion? M.B.: The word is inadequate. We will talk among ourselves and this will be the part that will be devoted to the voting and discussion procedure. But at the same time, we cordially invite you, there will be organized thematic panels, very interesting, educational, for example the panel ""The future of Polish education"". Donald Tusk's government wants to provide us students with a second paid field of study... K.G.: Donald Tusk again, Mr. M.B.: But we have to refer to those in power. Who will we refer to? We indicate solutions because this is not only criticism, but these are real and specific proposals.K.G.: Can we expect any resolution, I don't know, calling, supporting, persuading Lech Kaczy≈Ñski to run in the presidential elections for a second term?M.B.: The year 2010 It's a year of presidential elections and a year of local government elections, so we will certainly refer to both elections. Of course, the natural candidate of Law and Justice in the presidential elections is Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, whose presidency we consider very active and successful. We believe that President Kaczy≈Ñski represented our country with dignity, especially in foreign policy. These are the competences of the President of the Republic of Poland according to the current Constitution. So we will definitely refer to the elections... K.G.: But in the form of a resolution? M.B.: Well, we will see in what form, it is also full freedom. We will see in what form of delegation he expresses his opinions. But we will also talk about local government elections, which are extremely important, and we will also talk about, above all, the future of our country. K.G.: Coming back to the presidency of Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, how troublesome his statement was for Law and Justice that that he expects the support of ""serious political forces"", which can be clearly understood that this support is not there yet? M.B.: Well, it is basically that I already have an election campaign, although we do not know the date of the presidential elections, and we have an election campaign due to at our political competitors, the PO, who are beating each other up so much... K.G.: Well, other candidates from other parties have also come forward. M.B.: But I think that the public's attention is drawn primarily to this brutal dispute, this war in the PO between Bronislaw Komorowski and Radoslaw Sikorski, MP Palikot joins in, Mr. Schetyna intervenes, well, a lot is happening, although it is a completely pointless dispute. Therefore... Although we do not know the date of the presidential elections, the election campaign has apparently begun. We want to take our responsibilities seriously. President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski has not yet expressed his decision or will to run for office, I am convinced that he will be... K.G.: They say that maybe in May. M.B.: I am convinced that he will be a candidate and this is what happens in mature democracies, that the final president First-termers usually run in the next elections. And I think that this will also be the case in our country.K.G.: And if not, what?M.B.: I don't think so, I don't think so, but let's wait, have a little patience.K.G.: Should such a question be asked?M.B.: Let's not argue about that , who, let's just argue about what, what his proposal will be, what needs to be changed in our country. And here Law and Justice has specific proposals. K.G.: Will there be something about space at the Law and Justice congress? M.B.: Yes, there will indeed be such a panel, there will be interesting guests, also foreign ones. The point is that, for example, in the United States, but also in the European Union, everything related to space is also the driving force of science. And we want to point out... K.T.: Oh, in this context. M.B.: Yes, yes, the opportunities that space research gives to science, Polish science. This is undoubtedly an opportunity for us. K.G.: At first, one might get the impression that the congress listeners would like to hear General Miroslaw Hermaszewski's memories from space, but I guess that is out of the question. M.B.: Well, it is that, unfortunately, this the pointless dispute in the Platform, this theater, this spectacle causes us, like the editor, to approach public and political debate with some distance. But no, we want to talk seriously. And believe me, the proposals we will submit will be very serious. K.G.: And here you fully agree with what Tadeusz Cymanski said in the interview quoted: ""There are few program discussions, conversations about ordinary, human matters."" M.B.: Of course. I completely agree with that... K.G.: ""And this problem also concerns Law and Justice"" - Tadeusz Cymanski.M.B.: I fully agree with that. But please note that when we propose a debate, a very serious debate, it is marred by such transgressions, for example by Mr. Palikot. The platform does not want to talk about the most important issues, namely pensions, health care, public finance deficit, there is no debate. And in our opinion, this is a deliberate action of those in power who are running away from difficult issues. K.G.: Congress of Law and Justice in Pozna≈Ñ from today throughout Saturday and Sunday. The guest was Mariusz Blaszczak, an MP from Law and Justice.

In an election spot that appeared during the campaign (published on the website ryszka.com), the senatorial candidate said that he wanted to ""use his parliamentary experience for the common good, to strengthen Polish economic and national sovereignty.""The president of PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who also appeared in this election advertisement, pointed out that Ryszka has extensive experience in public life. ""He is a man closely connected with the Church, he is someone who throughout his life has supported everything that is the foundation of our common existence here in Silesia and throughout Poland,"" noted the head of PiS. The almost three-minute spot also included a regional thread. ""Slask was and should remain the economic pearl in the crown of Poland"", ""whoever thinks otherwise does not understand the specificity of our region, does not want the good of the homeland"" - emphasized Czeslaw Ryszka.

186304.0," Everyone who shops every day and pays all types of bills: for gas, housing, electricity or water, realizes how much the prices go up. However, the blame for this is not the free market, but largely the government. As of the new year, he has introduced a VAT increase on virtually all prices of goods and services and is ineffective in protecting the Polish consumer market against global increases in food prices. All this affects the budgets especially of the poorer part of society. Will the current situation result in people taking to the streets and waves of widespread protests? The media have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks: such an increase in food prices in stores has not been recorded for a long time. According to statistics from the Central Statistical Office, in January this year compared to January last year, with inflation reaching 3.8%, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by less than 5%, prices for housing and energy increased by over 6%, and transport (fuel and transport goods) by as much as 7.2 percent. Panic in stores. Press titles, for example from ""Polska. The Times‚Äù: ‚ÄúPanic in stores: expensive sugar disappears from shelves‚Äù or ‚ÄúDrozyzna is ruining our wallets‚Äù. The newspaper quotes, among others: statement by Edyta Kochlewska from the professional portal Dlahandlu.pl: - Only over the last two months, the average price of sugar in retail stores has increased by 35%, from approximately PLN 2.9 in December to PLN 3.9 at the end of February. And just a year ago, a kilogram of sweet product cost on average PLN 2.5. The situation was heated up by information in the media that at any moment a kilogram would cost PLN 5-7. In turn, the Rzesz√≥w branch of TVP reported that from March 1, some local bakeries will ask for an average of 20-30 cents more for a loaf than in February. ‚ÄúThe remaining producers are observing the market, but any day now they will probably adjust to a higher level. All because of the skyrocketing prices of maca. ""Not only bread is getting more expensive, but also sugar, sweets and dairy products."" According to one of the local confectioners, the prices of sugar and flour have increased by as much as 100% over the last 6 months. According to the Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics, by June the prices of flour, oil, vegetables and fruit will increase by about 5% on average. According to scientists, the reason is primarily the poor harvest last year. According to the Institute, dairy products are becoming more expensive due to high milk purchase prices. As a result, sweets, cocoa and coffee are more expensive. Unfortunately, that's not all. The prices of bread, as well as meat and cold cuts are influenced by the rapidly increasing prices of cereal grains (according to the Central Statistical Office data, they were 69 to 127 percent higher in January this year than a year earlier). In January this year the prices of wheat in procurement increased by 14% compared to December last year, and in markets by nearly 10%, of rye by approximately 19 and approximately 10%, respectively, and of barley by approximately 19 and approximately 12%, triticale by approximately 18 and approximately 12 percent, and oats by approximately: 27 and 15 percent. Prices were also higher, including: potatoes in markets (by almost 9%). Who is to blame? A large part of the responsibility for the current situation falls on the government, especially the Ministry of Finance and Agriculture. International factors also influence the prices (last year's crop failures in various parts of the world, rising fuel prices due to the uncertain situation in Libya and Bahrain, and previously in Egypt and Tunisia, etc.). It is worth recalling, however, that it was none other than the Minister of Finance Jacek Rostowski, instrumentally supported by Prime Minister Tusk, who introduced this year's VAT increases, which hit especially the poorest families. In the name of fighting the budget hole, for which such a high increase is entirely the responsibility of the current government. These increases cover virtually all goods purchased in stores every day, as well as bills: for gas, electricity and water used in apartments, not to mention rent, travel to work, housing, construction materials, etc. A drastic increase will come into force next year. VAT rates on children's clothes and footwear. Not to mention the already announced increase in the basic VAT rate by another 1%. In addition, there is the sheer incompetence of individual members of the government. How else can we explain the obedient acceptance by the current Minister of Agriculture of the so-called sugar production quotas imposed on Poland a few years ago by the European Union. As a result, we are only allowed to produce sugar up to a very specific level. This means that there is a shortage of it on the market, and consequently its prices increase. Government: it's not us. At the end of February, a debate took place in the Sejm on rising food prices. PiS MPs pointed out that it had increased by a quarter since the beginning of the year. They also recalled the assurances of the Minister of Finance, Jacek Rostowski, that after this year's changes in VAT, the increase in inflation would be only 0.4%, and food would increase by 0.7%. As reported by PAP, in response, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Jaroslaw Wojtowicz stated that the factors contributing to the current increases in food prices include, among others: speculation on the markets of metallurgical raw materials, energy and fuels. - This is not specific to Poland, it applies to all countries. These speculations are compounded by the situation with the supply of agricultural raw materials, i.e. smaller harvests in Russia and the closure of borders for grain exports, drought in Western Europe, and floods in Australia. Moreover, the demand for food in China and India is also increasing. When food prices rise, the psychological aspect is also important, Wojtowicz said. - You cannot tell people that inflation will be higher and that prices will increase, because this will result in people accepting price increases and inflation will actually increase - he said. PiS MPs, not satisfied with such an answer, finally demanded the dismissal of the Minister of Agriculture, supported by the entire coalition. Although these are not the times and not the same socio-political system, it is worth remembering that in our recent history there have already been social protests related to the high costs affecting families, often ending with a change of government. In the fateful December 1970, the authorities announced overnight increases in food prices (by 13-38%, with simultaneous reductions in the prices of some industrial products and also... locomotives). If the increase in ham (from 80 to 100 PLN/kg) did not seem dangerous (few people could afford it anyway), then, for example, in sugar (from 10.5 to 12 PLN/kg), bread, flour, common sausage or butter caused a violent social reaction. People did not trust the authorities that the increases would be compensated by the introduction of monthly salary supplements, which were intended to protect large families and the lowest earners (PLN 15-25 per person). They feared a sudden deterioration in their already averagely low standard of living. As a result, there were tragic strikes on the coast with many fatalities. This eventually led to the removal of Wladyslaw Gomulka's team, replaced by Edward Gierek. However, the new authorities did not abolish the introduced price increases. In June 1976, the authorities attempted another so-called price regulation. The scale of the increases this time was huge. Among other things, the price of sugar was to go up by 100 percent, meat - by 69 percent, butter and cheese - by 50 percent, and poultry - by 30 percent. As in previous years, the increases were to be accompanied by a reduction in the price of some industrial products, as well as (again small) compensation. As a result of workers' protests in Ursus, Radom and Plock, the authorities finally withdrew from the pay increases and thus saved their positions - for a few years. It was then that food stamps (so-called sugar vouchers) were introduced - for the first time since the 1950s - as well as the so-called commercial stores where you could buy food, especially cold meats and meat, at much higher prices than those applicable in ""ordinary"" stores. Let us also remember that the rising costs, which were not accompanied by appropriate wage increases, was one of the causes of strikes and the creation of Solidarity in 1980. This time Gierek's team had to leave. The new one, in its final incarnation with General Jaruzelski, could introduce further increases in food prices only under the cover of martial law and the ""labeling"" of almost everything sold in stores at that time. You will recognize them by their fruits. In the current situation, the activities of the government team for . monitoring prices on the food market, working for almost two years under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture. The team created and led by Minister Marek Sawicki and Deputy Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak (both PSL) turned out to be a failure. He was to ensure that food prices throughout the country did not increase too much. According to the minister, the point was that food prices were high in stores compared to extremely low prices in stores. And that intermediaries and sellers are to blame for this. According to Sawicki, whose idea was supported by Prime Minister Tusk, similar teams exist in Lithuania and France. However, as RMF FM radio commented, ""it didn't work because in February food prices were the highest in history."" Both ministers blame these situations on, among others, local government. ""A commune head, mayor and president who allows large supermarkets to operate and suppresses small and medium-sized traders,"" said Pawlak at a March conference at the Ministry of Agriculture. According to Sawicki, rising food prices can only be stopped by EU institutions, not the Polish government. ""If they do not decide today to strictly adhere to the delivery dates after concluding the futures contract, there will be no end to speculation,"" says the minister. Guilty speculators. He also emphasized that the current increase in food prices is not mainly the result of natural disasters, but of speculation on agricultural markets. Pointing to speculators as the main culprits for high prices seems to be the leading leitmotif of the minister's public appearances. At one of the meetings at the Ministry of Agriculture in February this year. he said that ""currently there are no important politicians on the EU and world forum who would not notice that the speculative factor is quite important in the current increase in food prices. If we refer to the world's food needs, growing demand and, at the same time, the volume of agricultural production, the market mechanism, which is the demand-supply relationship, does not indicate the need for such drastic and high increases in food prices. And in mid-February he predicted: ""This year we are dealing with scares. There are also economists who say that food prices will increase by 10%. They will not increase because the market will not bear it. There will certainly be no such increase in food prices. I think it will be at a level of no more than 5%.

194685.0," ""During Prime Minister Beata Szydlo's last visit to London, all safety rules and procedures were violated. The PiS government has not drawn any conclusions from the Smolensk disaster and continues to violate all safety procedures,"" said MP Marcin Kierwinski during a press conference in the Sejm. The chairman of the Parliamentary team to investigate cases of manipulation of the causes of the Smolensk disaster of April 10, 2010 in order to achieve political benefits pointed out that if the staff at the London airport and the civilian pilot had not agreed to the flight, another disaster could have occurred. The press conference of the Civic Platform concerned the reports by the author of the ""Dziennik Gazeta Prawna"" article about the omissions that occurred during the return of the Polish government delegation from a visit to London, where Polish-British consultations were held under the leadership of Prime Ministers: Beata Szydlo and Theresa May. More people were to return to the country on a government plane than there were seats available on the government-owned Embraer plane. Among those present on the plane were: Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Minister of Foreign Affairs Witold Waszczykowski, Minister of National Defense Antoni Macierewicz and Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Mariusz Blaszczak, i.e. people performing some of the most important functions in the state. _x000D__x000D_

 Jan Grabiec, spokesman for the Civic Platform, signaled that ""this aviation incident should be investigated by the State Commission for the Investigation of Aircraft Accidents, because there are too many cases of violations of safety standards."" The MP also noted that ""it should be assessed who made this risky decision, and people who violated the regulations adopted after this tragic flight to Smolensk should be punished."" ""If this does not happen, we can expect that once again at some ""On the next flight, the safety of the flight participants will be at risk again,"" he added. Marcin Kierwinski explained that ""during the organization of the flight, the HEAD instructions were violated, under which the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister cannot fly in one plane."" Also, the last-minute decision to connect two flights - one of journalists and the most important people in the state - constitutes a significant violation of the regulations. According to the procedures, the final list of passengers must be available 24 hours before departure, and in London, only on board the plane were people selected who could fly. ""Once again, in the PiS state, it turns out that procedures are not important. Once again, it turns out that everything can be done ad hoc, without thinking, and it will work out somehow,"" the parliamentarian said. He recalled that a similar situation occurred on April 10, 2010. ""It was not known who was on board until the last minute, the lists were changed at the last minute,"" he added. ‚ÄúThis scale of mess, unprofessionalism and violation of procedures cannot be tolerated, it may end badly. Let Antoni Macierewicz - the tracker of all conspiracies, find who is responsible for this conspiracy,"" appealed Marcin Kierwinski. He informed that the team he headed would conduct a comparative analysis of the visits to London and Smolensk. The MPs also referred to the comment of Beata Szydlo, head of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, who said that ""everything was done in accordance with the mythical HEAD instruction in civil aviation."" ""If the minister has such instructions, let him show them. Since there is a procedure that allows more people to be boarded than there is space and to provide a list of passengers before the flight, this is not serious,"" emphasized Marcin Kierwinski.¬† wl/pap ",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes governmental actions but does not irrationally claim that state institutions always favor a specific group.

186224.0," Last Wednesday in Strasbourg, a meeting was held in Strasbourg between the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Radoslaw Sikorski, and Polish Members of the European Parliament, devoted to preparations for our EU presidency. It's good that it happened because we finally learned about the government's actual plans and intentions in connection with the presidency. Unfortunately, what we heard from the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs raises great concern. It confirms the worst assumptions, previously reported by me and other PiS MEPs, that the Polish government really has no idea for a Polish presidency. This cannot be heard in Poland, where the prevailing belief, maintained by the mainstream media, is that everything is fine. Unfortunately, the meeting in Strasbourg revealed complete chaos in Polish preparations. This is what we learned, or rather what we received confirmation of, during the meeting with Minister Sikorski. Firstly, Poland does not intend to do anything else under its presidency than administering the activities and programs of the European Union. We will only fit into the existing EU agenda and its existing programs. However, we do not intend to present any goal that could be identified with the Polish presidency. This is completely incomprehensible, because the practice of previous presidencies shows that each presidency country introduced into its plans issues that were important from the point of view of both its own interests and the entire region in which it operates. The French have pushed through the Union of the Mediterranean, which is important for them, and Hungary is proposing the Danube Strategy. The Swedes prepared and implemented the Baltic Strategy. What about us? We propose the EU budget, relations with the East within the Eastern Partnership, energy security and the internal market, and in fact, coordination of existing programs. Why can't we, for example, afford to propose to Europe the issue of fighting the ongoing demographic crisis, developing an action plan to intensify EU policies in the Carpathian region, or taking steps to equalize development opportunities for citizens of the old and new Union? Secondly, during the meeting with Sikorski it turned out that we still do not have a final, even approximate, list of priorities. In addition to those mentioned earlier, the minister mentioned that perhaps the goal of our presidency will be to complete the accession negotiations with Croatia, the association agreement with Ukraine, and accelerate the integration of the Balkans with the EU. Great, but all these goals appeared for the first time. They have never been on the list of even the initial Polish priorities before. It is clear that we still do not know what we want to achieve during this presidency. Let me remind you that it starts in a little over 4 months. Thirdly, we already know for sure that agriculture and the equalization of subsidies between farmers of the old and new EU will not be on the list of Polish presidency goals. The disproportions that currently exist are very large. A Polish farmer receives approximately EUR 190 in subsidies per hectare, while German farmers receive EUR 340, Danish farmers EUR 390, French farmers EUR 260 and Italian farmers EUR 320. So why is there no demand to equalize payments for farmers among the goals of the Polish presidency? It is no secret that negotiations on the shape of the EU's common agricultural policy are entering a decisive phase and it is during our presidency that we would have the greatest opportunity to seek and create the most beneficial solutions for farmers from the new Union. Similarly, we know that the goals of the Polish Presidency will not include dynamising and developing activities within the existing Baltic Strategy. This is also not understandable. After all, the first revision and evaluation of this Strategy is to take place during our EU presidency. Isn't it worth taking up this topic during the presidency in the context of Nord Stream and its obvious threats to the Baltic Sea ecosystem and the Polish maritime economy and our energy security? This seems obvious, but unfortunately not for the Polish government. Fourthly, why is Poland pushing so hard to strengthen integration within the common security and defense policy among the goals of the Polish Presidency? All within the framework of cooperation with Germany and France? Does this serve Poland at all? Won't this belittle the role of NATO? By ""increased integration"" do we mean a procedure of enhanced cooperation, which in this area may lead to the disintegration of the Euro-Atlantic area? Fifth, the question arises what will remain of our presidency. What will the Polish Presidency be identified with? According to Minister Sikorski, accession negotiations with Croatia may be completed (if the Hungarians have not done so earlier). Perhaps with the association treaty with Ukraine, which has not been the goal of the Polish Presidency so far. There will definitely be a new Polish embassy in Brussels, which is scheduled to open soon. And, of course, the brilliant idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to give visiting diplomats wind-up wooden, handmade sideburns during the presidency, which are to be a symbol of the Polish presidency. But what will this presidency bring to Poland? Apparently nothing, or very little. Managing the EU is hard organizational, legislative and political work. Its goal should be not only efficient management of the EU for half a year, but also strengthening Poland's role and position in Europe. Belgium could afford to administer, as it has not had a government for several months, and yet it had a relatively successful presidency. However, Poland is a large European country that should be expected to initiate various European policies, and not only coordinate the EU's work. Sixthly, what should the Polish presidency serve? I am more and more sure that, first of all, it is to be part of the image campaign of the Civic Platform government. It is clear that Donald Tusk's government wants to take over the presidency only for itself and treat it as a form of self-promotion. Several receptions with EU diplomats, meetings with heads of government and outdoor concerts are intended to show Poles the European face of PO and add seriousness and splendor to the Polish government. It's about leaving a good impression, not about strengthening Poland's role in the European Union.

184561.0," The politically correct government and the PO parliamentary club did not hesitate to decide to refer to the Constitutional Tribunal - following the example of Germany - reservations about the superiority of EU decisions over decisions of the Polish parliament, consistent with the interests of the state. A tiny Central American country, Haiti, is experiencing a terrible tragedy after earthquake. Haiti is associated with something like a tropical paradise, eagerly visited by the French, former colonialists, who did not particularly care about the fate of their former black slaves. The country has long been plunged into chaos and poverty. He didn't bother anyone, so no one cared about him. Today, the international community, led by the UN, is rushing to help those residents of Port au Prince who survived the disaster and have nothing - no water, food or medicine. The only positive effect of the earthquake may be a serious attempt to restore Haiti to political, economic and social balance. This is the intention of the European Union countries, and above all the United States, which has rushed with the greatest help, including logistical assistance. The European Union has many more problems to deal with than Haiti - you know, the Lisbon Treaty has entered into force, the Brussels bureaucracy is now headed by two presidents: the President of the European Council, a Belgian, Herman Van Rumpuy, and a well-known political politician, the head of the European Commission, Jose Barroso. And there is also a British baroness with a leftist origin, Catherine Ashton, the plenipotentiary for EU external relations, something like the EU minister of foreign affairs. She has no idea about the world and that's why during a hearing in the European Parliament she talked nonsense about relations with Russia, stating that Europe should act together when it comes to energy supplies from Russia. This does not bode well for the future and we will be surprised what policy Lady Ashton will pursue towards the Kremlin. However, my attention was caught by an article by the former Christian Democratic president of Germany, Roman Herzog, published in the liberal daily ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"". Herzog made serious accusations against the Brussels bureaucracy, accusing it of harming European ideals, and warned that the European Union was facing an existential crisis. According to the former German president, Brussels imposes too many different legal regulations on the member states. Herzog appeals to the 27 EU countries to firmly reject Brussels' interference in national jurisdiction. The EU, and specifically the Eurobureaucracy, is guided by the principle of subsidiarity and interferes in various areas of life of individual countries. A grotesque example of such subsidiarity was the European Commission's decision on benefits available to single women in the Federal Republic of Germany. The German government questioned this aid and ultimately rejected it. It is impossible not to agree with Roman Herzog's concerns. We find ourselves in an unenviable situation - our parliament will soon act as an ornamental association for the approval of EU directives and legal regulations. The politically correct government and the PO parliamentary club did not hesitate to decide to refer to the Constitutional Tribunal - following the example of Germany - reservations about the superiority of EU decisions over decisions of the Polish parliament, consistent with the interests of the state. The PiS project concerning changes to the constitution, criticized by the ruling party, contains ideas of increasing the role of the Constitutional Tribunal. Its competences should include very extended rights of citizens to make an individual constitutional complaint, also against decisions of various bodies. The Constitutional Tribunal would be the supreme body of the judiciary, with the power to overturn decisions of all other bodies that are inconsistent with the constitution. This fragment of the PiS draft constitution is of great importance for the functioning of our country and the democratization of society. I don't know if what happened in Germany would be possible in Poland today - an ordinary citizen, a politician from the Bavarian CSU, submitted a constitutional complaint to the Federal Constitutional Court, in which he protests against the dictate of Brussels, which is inconsistent with the Constitution, in matters to be decided by the Parliament. , i.e. the Bundestag. After half a year of debate, the German tribunal agreed with Gauweiler and announced that the parliament has priority in adopting laws over the European Parliament and other EU institutions. The politically correct government and the PO parliamentary club did not hesitate to decide to refer the reservations to the Constitutional Tribunal - following the German example - on the superiority of EU decisions over decisions of the Polish Parliament, consistent with the interests of the state. The PiS constitution contains many extremely important proposals aimed at strengthening the Polish state and protecting the interests of ordinary citizens, as well as their right to participate in decisions important for the nation. It also contains a passage on strengthening the role and functions of the president. I wonder why politicians of the Civic Platform, convinced that Donald Tusk will win the elections for president of the Republic of Poland, are not happy about the opportunity given to him by Law and Justice - the possibility of continuing the power he has as prime minister. Well, maybe not full power, but part of it that the current head of state - Lech Kaczynski - does not have. The European Union is preoccupied with the financial crisis in which the biggest loser is Germany, losing its leading position in the field of exports to China and recording a five percent decline in GDP, not particularly is concerned about the serious threat of the so-called eastern policy, in the center of which is Ukraine. As we learn from election forecasts, the first round was won by the pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych, ahead of Julie Tymoshenko by 5 to 10 percent. The defeat was suffered by Viktor Yushchenko, the hero of the ""Orange Revolution"", a man who wanted to integrate Ukraine with the European Union and NATO. He received only 6 percent support, which deprives him of any hope of participating in the country's politics. Unless, as rumors say, if Yanukovych wins the second round, he will offer Yushchenko the post of prime minister. It would be strange, but not impossible. It must be remembered that Yanukovych, considered a man of oligarchy, will not want to give up the pro-Western ideas of his predecessor, which could lead to protests from a significant part of society. I think he will want to reconcile the Kremlin's ambitions with the expectations of society, which wants to improve living conditions and standards. And these standards are the property of the West, not backward and drunken Russia. Yulia Tymoshenko announced that if she wins the elections, she will integrate Ukraine with the European Union within a few years. The incredibly well-dressed first lady of Ukraine with a wreath of artificial braid on her head does not arouse enthusiasm among citizens, although some of them - almost many of them - prefer to choose her over Yanukovych, who is clearly associated with the eastern, pro-Russian region of the country. Western media have no problem with the elections in Ukraine. What will be, it will be. And so it is with everything in Brussels. We should be concerned about the degradation of our community to which we wanted to belong so much. This degradation, which Roman Herzog talks about in his article, may mean the incapacitation of nations and states. Failures and disappointments will not be eliminated by the Charlemagne Award awarded to Donald Tusk. Everyone in Europe has already received it, small and big, famous and less famous.

190942.0," 1. ""Or magazines"" is a deleted fragment of a sentence from the draft government act on radio and television, adopted in 2002, changing the meaning and scope of some key provisions of this act.¬†The original version of the draft law adopted by the government included a ban on issuing a license for national television to ""publishers of a national daily or magazine"".¬†In March 2002, as determined by the parliamentary commission of inquiry into the Rywin scandal, officials of the National Broadcasting Council and the Ministry of Culture deleted two words ""or magazines"" from the bill, which meant that the ban on granting licenses for national television would apply to publishers of daily newspapers (e.g. Agora, the publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza). but not weekly publishers, competitors for these licenses.¬†2. It seems that the draft act on the NBP is very similar, except that in this case no provisions were deleted, and a provision was added stating the possibility of the NBP purchasing treasury bonds on the secondary market. This happened after the meeting of the President of the NBP Marek Belka with the Minister of Internal Affairs Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz in July 2013, about which we learned from the so-called tapes of truth.¬†Let us just recall that this overheard conversation clearly showed that the ruling Platform decided that it could treat the independent NBP as an institution with financial resources that could be called upon in difficult moments of governance.¬†Unfortunately, this was allowed by the president of the NBP, Marek Belka, who, despite his PZPR origins, was considered an apolitical specialist at the time of his nomination for this position. Belka's public statements absolutely disqualify him not only as the president of the central bank but also as a man who the body that is the MPC and its members speak like a lumberjack from a beer stand (an important member of the MPC, former Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Hausner, commented in a similar way on the effects of Belka's conversation with Sienkiewicz).¬†He demanded the resignation of the constitutional Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Jan Vincent Rostowski and changes in the laws regulating the activities of the NBP, and in return he declared financing the budget deficit with the NBP's profit depending on the needs of those in power, and even public debt through the purchase of treasury bonds on the secondary market.¬†3. Recently, the Council of Ministers has just adopted assumptions for the draft act amending the Act on the NBP, which allow for the purchase of State Treasury bonds by the NBP on the secondary market (the purchase of such securities on the primary market is prohibited by EU law and that is the only reason such a solution was not included in the government proposals and probably soon such changes in this act will also be adopted by the coalition majority in the Sejm).¬†Now this project is on the list of legislative works of the Prime Minister's Office, which means that it will be adopted by the Council of Ministers this year and will go to the Sejm, where the coalition majority of the Platform and PSL will probably adopt it without undue delay.¬†However, provisions about such a possibility appear in the government's assumptions for the amendment of the Act on the NBP only in July 2013, after the meeting between Belek and Sienkiewicz, and this is very reminiscent of the story with the removal of the phrase ""or magazine"".¬†4. It seems that thanks to this manipulation, the president of the NBP will receive an instrument of enormous importance; if difficult times come and the government will not be able to sell treasury bonds with a specific yield on the primary market, then e.g. the Bank will purchase them Gospodarstwa Krajowego, but in just 10 minutes the NBP will be able to buy it from him.¬†In this way, formally, the central bank will not finance public debt on the primary market, only on the secondary market, and this government amendment to the Act on the NBP is about providing the central bank with such an opportunity.¬†Zbigniew Kuzmiuk ",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes government performance without asserting that state institutions favor any particular group.

186045.0," Polemic with the text by Konrad Niklewicz in ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" entitled: ""PiS criticizes with mistakes"". Today's ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" published an involved text by Editor Konrad Niklewicz, which is a response to yesterday's press conference of Law and Justice in the Polish Sejm on the state of preparations our country to the presidency of the European Union. In his article, Editor Niklewicz called the criticism of the Polish presidency plans, which we presented together with the Chairman of the PiS Club, Mariusz Blaszczak, and MEP Ryszard Czarnecki, as inaccurate and untrue. The problem is that the Editor himself, cleverly omitting the most important facts presented by PiS MPs, manipulated the text in such a way that the reader has the impression that all the information presented is untrue. What is particularly sad, he showed a lack of basic knowledge about the state of Poland's preparations for the EU presidency, which in the case of a journalist dealing with these issues is simply embarrassing. Firstly. From the text by editor Niklewicz we learn that Polish farmers receive similar amounts of subsidies for agricultural production as their colleagues from the old EU. The Editor writes that after adding all the allowances, each hectare of crops amounted to EUR 540 in Greece, EUR 350 in France, EUR 421 in Germany, and EUR 320 in Poland. This is not true and proves the editor's simple lack of knowledge and orientation in this matter. He does not know that, according to the accession treaty, our farmers will only receive 60% of subsidies in 2013 compared to farmers from the so-called Old EU, which amounts to approximately EUR 190 per hectare and these will be all funds from the EU budget settled on the number of hectares intended for agricultural production in Poland. Meanwhile, German farmers receive EUR 340, Danish farmers EUR 390, French farmers EUR 260 and Italian farmers EUR 320. These are generally available data from the European Commission, which I will be happy to forward to the Editor if necessary. Therefore, Law and Justice demands equalization of the amount of agricultural subsidies in the new CAP and including it as a priority of the Polish Presidency. Why the government hasn't done this yet is astonishing. Secondly, the arguments that none of the countries include in their presidency plans matters important from the point of view of their interests are absurd and unworthy of someone who is considered a specialist in European politics. Mr. Editor, when can we best do it, now or during the Greek or Maltese presidencies that await us in the coming years? In this matter, I refer you to tons of scientific literature on carrying national interests through decision-making processes in the EU, so that you can learn how it is done and how others have done it, it is not a secret. I especially recommend texts by Jonas Tallberg or Ben Crum, which speak directly about this, as well as recent publications on this matter by the Jagiellonian University and the Warsaw School of Economics. I also remind the Editor that the French pushed through the Mediterranean Union, which is important for them, Hungary proposes the Danube Strategy, and what do we do? We abandon the Baltic Strategy as our priorities and propose an EU Budget, negotiations on which during the Polish Presidency have long been included in the EU agenda. Thirdly and fourthly: the polemic with the arguments regarding Mr Czarnecki's statement is misplaced because the government did not present the full costs of the presidency, but resorted to the formula of ""expenditures from the state budget"" for the presidency, so can we find out the full costs? It is also worth the government publishing not only the winners of contracts for services for the presidency, but also the list of applicants and the procedures for their selection. Fifth: the Polish government, in 2009, presented four goals of the presidency, including: Eastern Partnership, Energy Security and Baltic Sea Strategy. And just a year and a half later, the goals had changed significantly. The problem is that the official government documents regarding the Polish presidency no longer talk about the Baltic Sea or even the Eastern Partnership, but about relations with the East. It may seem the same, but it may mean completely different tasks and goals. I agree with you that Hungary is organizing the Eastern Partnership summit, i.e. a meeting of the heads of government of EU countries, where the most important decisions can be made. The subsequent meeting of foreign ministers in Poland will have a much smaller scope and decision-making potential. I don't have to convince the Editor what this proves. Editor Niklewicz's text is unique in its form, even by the standards of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"". It was not intended to be an objective media report from the press conference, but a very emotional polemic with the preconceived thesis that PiS is unfairly attacking the government for the chaos visible to the naked eye in preparations for the Polish presidency. A polemic on the verge of journalistic ethics, which makes me ask another important question publicly: is it true that Mr. Editor Niklewicz has already received and accepted an offer to take up the position of the official government spokesman of the Polish Presidency? If this is so, then yesterday's report from the PiS press conference presented by Editor Niklewicz, full of silence and manipulation, is below all ethical and journalistic standards and simply discredits him for the future. I also wonder how, in such a case, his parent editorial office intends to maintain the standards of journalistic objectivity in reporting on the affairs of the presidency?

187879.0," Yesterday on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie, good won over evil. The good of memory and truth has triumphed over the evil of oblivion and silence. Thousands of candles were burning again on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie and white and red flags were proudly flying. Poles were together again and showed that they wanted to jointly honor the memory of the victims of the Smolensk disaster. They proved that time does not blur memory and does not invalidate questions about what really happened at the Severny airport. Poles also showed the current authorities how to pay tribute to those who served their homeland. However, on April 10, 2012, on the second anniversary of the Smolensk Disaster, the Polish state was silent. It was silent. However, it was not a silence of reflection, prayer or remembrance. It was a silence that was supposed to loudly shout ""Nothing happened!"", ""No problem!"". The anniversary, quietly celebrated by the Polish authorities, has one goal: to silence and erase the memory, and with it questions about the truth, about the wreck, about black boxes, about autopsies, about the lie about the drunk general, about disgrace and lack of honor, about sloppiness, mess , oh bad faith... Yesterday there were over 30,000 of us on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie. And nothing will silence it. The image will not be manipulated by mainstream media or government propaganda. It's not possible anymore. You can remove ""illegal"" candles and flowers at night, but nothing will destroy this solidarity in memory. It is hard and lasting, because it grows from the belief that a nation that loses memory ceases to exist. I would like to thank all those who bore witness to memory and truth yesterday, once again from the depths of my heart. Let us not lose faith in a better, just, strong and modern Poland. The day will come when the truth will triumph. You have to believe in it and strive for it together.

185791.0," Defending the interests of the beneficiaries of the Round Table Agreement generates PO's fierce propaganda aggression against the opposition. Is the murder in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ a warning for Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski? The reaction of the main media to the murder in the Law and Justice office in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ closely resembles their reaction to the disaster in Smolensk. As then, so now, first, short words of regret are uttered, and then - instead of a real explanation of the causes of the event - contradictory information obfuscating the realities of the case and calls to stop mutual aggression, intertwined with pointing out the guilty among the victims - in the PiS camp. People who are disobedient or too inquisitive are tried to gag their mouths with accusations of ""hate speech"". Just as Smolensk in PO propaganda was supposed to be only an opportunity for Polish-Russian reconciliation, L√≥d≈∫ is supposed to illustrate what discord in politics leads to. It is known that whatever PO people say about ""finishing the pack"" - only Jaroslaw Kaczynski sows discord. In the PO narrative, he is responsible for the attack on the PiS office in Lodz, just like Lech Kaczynski for the disaster in Smolensk. Those who are not convinced about the causes of the murder in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ are provided with quotes from opposition politicians. What is said is what they said. There is no mention of the fact that a man died in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Why? Because the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ massacre - like Smolensk - is a mirror in which PO can see the true face of its rule. Under the rule of the Platform, planes carrying the commanders of the Polish Army and the president of Poland, hated by the PO people, fall down. Democratic opposition activists are murdered in their offices. Meanwhile, the pro-government media do not talk about these facts, but only about what one of the politicians said. It's better not to look at reality as it is - because fear! However, you can be outraged by the words as much as you want, because it is a perfect substitute topic. It's better to blame the victims - for provoking the perpetrators - than to look yourself in the eye. These types of mechanisms are known in psychology as defense mechanisms: rationalization, denial of guilt. We have been saying for years that PiS are haters, and here a PiS activist dies at the hands of a killer who wanted to ""murder Kaczynski"". No, it was not us who pushed this killer to act with our propaganda - it was PiS itself that provoked him... Therefore, the more calls to stop hatred are made by PO people, the more anger will remain hidden. In order to eliminate the dissonance between the facts and their interpretation, to deny what everyone sees, to prove to oneself and others that, in fact, it is PiS that is guilty of the attack on its premises. We must assume that Law and Justice is even worse than it previously seemed. In this way, hatred towards political opponents only increases a notch higher. Hence the wave of claims about the anti-constitutional and anti-systemic nature of the opposition, calls for its delegalization, isolation, etc., which are flooding us today. Meanwhile, the current propaganda game of PO and its satellites to demonize the image of the opposition has already borne poisonous fruit. The murder in Lodz is one of them. The second, and the first chronologically, is the emergence of a radical wing in the government camp in the form of the Palikot movement. The uninhibited attack on the opponent had already caused side effects in the body of the PO itself. Further psychologically driven burdening of PiS with responsibility for all evil, including indirect responsibility for the attack on the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ office, involuntarily (?) supports the extreme assessments previously expressed by Palikot and strengthens his position in the future. Once the spiral of aggression has started, it cannot be stopped. The return of the ""system"". However, one may ask - and this is the fundamental question - why it was started at all. Specialists in what someone said will exchange quotes and argue about who started the war of words. However, this does not lead to anything except more gossip, and obscures the essence of the matter, which lies not in words, but in interests. Let us recall that until the 2005 elections, PO and PiS were quite consistent, announcing the creation of a PO-PiS coalition. However, it was a time when, based on polls, PO believed that it would have a majority in a coalition with PiS. When it turned out that Lech Kaczynski and PiS were the winners of the elections, there were televised pseudo-coalition negotiations which ended with PO breaking off the talks. Previously, PiS was conditionally accepted as a potential minority coalition partner. However, when it turned out that he could win the elections and rule, he could no longer be tolerated. The weak Law and Justice party, holding some offices but lacking government initiative, could continue to function as a side of PO, especially since the Platform could play it in cooperation with the media. But PiS, which liquidated the WSI, established the CBA, and returned to lustration, turned out to be an opponent of the same type as the government of Jan Olszewski in 1991‚Äì1992. Therefore, in the years 2005-2007, the same measures were used against him - only in greater doses: obstruction, psychological warfare and slander. This continues to this day, because PiS potentially still has a chance of winning the election. So the propaganda and verbal aggression is not due to ambition, but is an expression of a real conflict of interests and fear of this party's return to power. The current conflict of interests has its roots in the Round Table and the early years of transformation. It was then that a system was developed defining the views that must be expressed in order to be able to hold offices in Poland, receive bank loans for business activities, work in the public media and universities, enjoy social prestige and get promoted. These are, as we know, views based on liberal-left political correctness, including historical amnesia regarding the years of communism, anti-lustration attitude, critical and selective attitude to national tradition, etc. They have been jointly voiced by the partners of the Round Table Agreements and their younger prot√©g√©s over the last 20 years. There was to be a political game only between them, only they recognized themselves as entitled to represent Poland, get rich from privatization and change power within the framework of democratic procedures. Anti-communists and supporters of a complete break with the power system of the Polish People's Republic were subject to the principle of marginalization and exclusion, in the name of the security of the communist nomenklatura and the inviolability of the privileged position of its allies from the former ""Solidarity"" camp. This system underwent various metamorphoses in the Third Polish Republic, but it did not change in its essence. For several weeks, under the rule of President Komorowski, it has been experiencing its true renaissance. It covers all presidential nominations, starting with those made by Bronislaw Komorowski while still serving as head of state, Marshal of the Sejm. At his request, unorthodox journalists and programs are removed from public media. The public media have almost entirely adopted a united-front character in eliminating and combating PiS. The idea is to weaken these parties as much as possible before the upcoming parliamentary elections. It has been noticed that PiS generally gains support during the campaign, and its poll ratings drop in the inter-campaign periods. After the presidential elections, which were nerve-racking for PO until the last moment, it was decided not to wait for the next campaign, but to deal with the matter immediately: to discredit and weaken the PiS leadership so as to cause a large outflow of its electorate before the elections. For this purpose, a game of internal divisions was started, investments were made in creating a positive image of people in conflict with the party, potential apostates, and above all, the atmosphere of hysteria around its president was constantly harassed, judged and heated up. The price of government PO. This is the political genesis of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ crime. This fact causes consternation among the PO electorate, who have a different idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthemselves and probably did not expect that someone like Ryszard C. would appear on their side of the barricade. Therefore, on the one hand, the PO electorate is convinced by the voices of publicists and scientific authorities that the aggressive language of politics allegedly initiated by PiS is responsible for the murderer's actions, on the other hand, it is calmed down by the morning lighting of candles by the president and prime minister in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the wholesale protection of politicians of various stripes under the the impact of a sudden outpouring of knowledge about their threat, which no one had even considered a week ago. The point is that another scandal under PO's rule - as usual - will be drowned in information noise. So that - as in the Smolensk case - no one bears any responsibility and so that the confused public opinion continues to be excited about the alleged shortcomings of PiS, which, although it no longer has any influence on anything, but which, together with its electorate, still has too much political potential. People who, after Smolensk and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, still believe that Poland's greatest misfortune is the activities of Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski and the existence of his party, the price that Poland pays after 2007 for their electoral decisions should be shown. After all, it is not Kaczynski who is currently indebting the state and announcing laws that will ruin the health service and universities - laws that are today protested against by the same corporations that not so long ago brought Donald Tusk's team to power. It was not during the PiS government that a series of unexplained military aviation disasters occurred and it was not PiS that closed down Polish shipyards while negotiating with the famous Qatari investor. The Platform is responsible for the gambling scandal and the resignation and prosecution of the head of the CBA for discovering it. It is the Platform that, instead of liberalism and a ""friendly state"", funds another tens of thousands of jobs in state administration, and instead of the Odessa - Brody - Plock pipeline, the Russian-German Nord Stream crossing our waterway to Swinoujscie. The reality, contrary to appearances, is painfully fair, it is I mean, everyone sooner or later gets what they want more. Whoever believed that ""education is the most important thing in our parochial society"" and in 2007 chose a team of enlightened Europeans, the Platform will now take a six-year-old child from home to a dirty and poorly heated school in winter. Anyone who was afraid of the ""closed Catholicism"" of Radio Maryja and joined the ""open"" journalists of ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" in its criticism, has a cross made of beer cans on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie and a Palikot rally. Whoever in 2007, as a doctor or academic, preferred the disintegration of the state to the continuation of PiS rule, gets what he preferred, with the disintegration of his own professional environment to perfection. An investigative commission is needed. The ≈Å√≥d≈∫ crime is part of this landscape of progressive collapse. The media immediately assumed that it was an individual act of a madman, and no one even considered the possibility that there could have been some organized action behind it. Similarly, on April 10, it was immediately assumed that the Smolensk disaster was caused by pilots, and the discussion of other hypotheses was called a conspiracy theory. If the murderer shouted into the camera that he wanted to kill Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, the question arises what he was doing in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and why he didn't attack his greatest enemy at all. After all, in recent weeks, the PiS president has appeared in public many times, for example during street demonstrations. So maybe the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ crime was supposed to be a warning for him? To stop appearing in public? Or would he think that the possibility of an attack was also taken into account by someone? The date of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ attack, related to the anniversary of the murder of the priest. Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko, would then seem like an intentional, clear allusion. These are, of course, only theoretical guesses. But the number of unpunished political murders in Poland in the 1980s, which were dealt with by the so-called Rokita's commission, the theory is no longer there. In this situation, the first step towards any reconciliation between the conflicting parties should be the appointment of a joint parliamentary commission to investigate the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ case, chaired by a PiS representative, to prove that no one has anything to hide in this matter. Such a parliamentary investigation, credible to the opposition, could constitute a bridgehead for rebuilding at least minimal trust between the ruling camp and PiS. If things do not move in this direction, the current division of the political scene will become even more acute and permanent.

199919.0," The task of the government is to build an ecosystem that favors the establishment of non-governmental organizations and civic initiatives. Changes to the Act on Assemblies and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãestablishing the National Center for the Development of Civil Society prove that PiS perceives the organization of citizens as a threat that should be controlled. Cyclical appropriation of public space A group of PiS MPs submitted a draft amendment to the Act on Assemblies. One of the main proposed changes is the introduction of the category of ""cyclical meetings"". The definition of this type of meeting is as follows: ""organized by the same organizer in the same place or on the same route at least four times a year according to a prepared schedule or at least once a year on public and national holidays, and such events took place over the last three years, even if not in the form of assemblies, and were intended in particular to celebrate momentous and important events for the history of the Republic of Poland. Changes are proposed in individual provisions of the Act on Assemblies. , which will create an excellent gateway to block assemblies that are inconvenient for the authorities and promote only the right ones, i.e. those with the word nation in the title. Here are the ideas of PiS MPs regarding ""cyclical assemblies"": - cyclical assemblies are to be given priority in choosing the place and time of organizing the assembly, if its place and time overlap at least partially with another assembly, - the commune authority may issue a decision to ban the assembly if it is to be held in the same place and time as the cyclical assembly, - participants of a spontaneous assembly cannot disturb the course of .among others cyclical assembly, - a spontaneous assembly may be dissolved by the police if it disrupts the course of the cyclical assembly. In principle, it will still be possible to convene assemblies against the PiS government, but it may turn out that the organizers of this type of demonstrations of dissatisfaction will encounter a number of new, previously unknown difficulties. The proposed changes to individual provisions of the Act on Assemblies will create an excellent gateway to blocking demonstrations that are inconvenient for the authorities and promoting only the right ones, i.e. those with the word nation in the title. If the formula of ""cyclical assemblies"" is introduced into Polish law, a dangerous precedent of gradation of validity will be created. one demonstration over another. This will be a significant limitation of civil liberties, because a state or local government official will assess which assembly is more important and which does not have a ""national"" rank. Throughout the period of the Third Polish Republic, social groups with different views learned to cooperate in public space and not compete with each other. by blocking each other's demonstration spaces. ""Smolensk monthly anniversaries"" take place without any problems, this year's Independence Day is also a good example that everyone can demonstrate and no additional regulations regulating the periodicity of meetings are necessary. National Center of the NationThe idea of ‚Äã‚Äãestablishing the National Center for the Development of Civil Society could only have been born in the mind, which in the process of perceiving the world stopped at the beginning of the 20th century, when people believed in the omnipotence of the government and the state. ¬†Prime Minister Beata Szydlo announced in ""Tygodnik Solidarnosc"" the creation of a new institution which, according to her, will control non-governmental organizations. The center is supposed to set goals and provide money for their implementation to foundations and associations. Non-governmental organizations are a source of soft power that strengthens, not weakens, the state. Only political groups that cannot stand any competition and are afraid of any manifestation of independence in the field of functioning of the state can think about manually controlling the development of civil society. The schedule for establishing the National Center for the Development of Civil Society imposes a truly express pace, because the new institution is to start operating in two months. . Moreover, the consultations on the presented document will be accompanied by a bad atmosphere. The project appears just after News and TVP Info started a storm around non-governmental organizations, pointing out those where the families of PO politicians worked, but in fact accusing the entire community of unclear activities. It is doubtful that such a pace and such attitude of the government will allow for a good discussion of the project, discussion of provisions favorable to non-governmental organizations, as well as a real assessment of the effects of introducing the new regulation. One thing is already clear today, non-governmental organizations will be controlled by PiS vice-president Adam Lipinski, who already today serves as the government's representative for civil society. Both projects show what view of the world PiS politicians have. It is dangerously close to 20th century ideas about individual subordination to national interests.

197276.0," SLD organized another economic debate. This time the main panelist was Grzegorz Kolodko. - Professor Kolodko is the author of over 400 articles and scientific papers translated into 25 languages. He is one of the most famous economists not only in Europe, but also in the world - the head of the Alliance, Leszek Miller, announced to the panelist. In the introduction to the lecture ""WHERE IS THE WORLD AND POLAND DIE?"" G. Kolodko criticized Polish policy in recent years for being too global. He emphasized that Polish activity on world markets was greater in the Polish People's Republic than after the transformation.¬†He noted that - Unemployment in Poland is one of the highest in Europe. And taking comfort in the fact that the situation is worse in Spain or Greece is irresponsible. How can you repeat the stupidity about the green island so many times? - Kolodko asks rhetorically.¬†Prof. Referring to the example of Greece, Kolodko said: - Many Greeks live beyond their means. They treat tax evasion as a national sport. The former deputy prime minister warns that the situation is dangerous. Because further loans to Greece are nothing more than passing the banks' debt onto people. ""And what did Poland propose? What did this great minister of finance and an even greater prime minister propose? Nothing! The tone is set by 'merkozy',"" Kolodko criticizes. He adds that with such a policy, Greece will not remain in the euro zone. ""We need to ask ourselves whether the costs of getting Greece out of the crisis are lower than the costs of Greece's collapse,"" he said.¬†According to the professor, the Polish economy should develop much faster than assumed by Donald Tusk's government - at a rate of 2, 4, 6 percent. GDP. ""The growth this year will be 2 percent. Therefore, let us pray for it to end as soon as possible. But next year it will not be better, since the government assumes growth at the level of 2.2 percent of GDP. With this attitude, the crisis in Poland will only deepen,"" says Kolodko. ""Poland is developing below average! This should be changed! - he adds. How? According to Kolodka, investment expenditure should be increased. ""I agree with Prime Minister Tusk, who announced an increase in investment expenditure on Friday. But why didn't he do it three years ago? And I wrote to the Prime Minister about it three years ago in an open letter,"" he noted. ""What is the modern left supposed to be about? The aim is to set economic regulations in such a way that there is fair competition. And today, the state is subordinated to the private sector, which seeks maximum profit,"" says Kolodko. He adds that fair competition must be based on respect for the customer, not on cheating and tricking. ""The left also focuses on the development of education. Secondary education must be a state obligation, because without it we will not be competitive. We also need to rebuild vocational education,"" he emphasizes. ""Today, a large number of Poles live and work in other countries. During the SLD government, more people came to Poland than left it. Were there more BMWs on our streets back then? NO! But we have created a perspective for development! ""Unfortunately, the right wing has zeroed the economy"" - Prof. Kolodko criticized the PiS and PO governments. The speaker says clearly about taxes: - ""The possibility of not paying taxes should be abolished!"" According to the former Minister of Finance, the latest proposal of the SLD to restore the third tax scale for the richest at the level of 40 percentage is right. Referring to the question from the audience about equality, she admits that she is not a feminist and does not support parity. Why? ""Because women are able to achieve more than men,"" she emphasizes that she is in favor of equal opportunities. ""There are more girls than boys in Iranian universities. But today the right wing, fundamentalists, are trying to limit the majors for girls. I'm going in the direction that women should stay at home, have children, and not work, for example, as a surgeon. And this is contrary to development!"" - he says. After Kolodka's speech, a lively debate began. A lot of questions were asked, including whether there might be a war in the near future. Such opinions appear, among others, in the United States, which could allegedly declare war on China. ""This is not the time of military crisis yet,"" says Kolodko. Even if, for example, China tried to annex Taiwan by force, the US would not decide to go to war I know I will win. And today no one can win against China. So, threatening war is pure populism,"" says the former deputy prime minister. However, he claims that there may be a trade, currency or legal war. The meeting was also attended by SLD experts on economic affairs, Wojciech Szewko, and education experts, Krystyna Lybacka. The discussion part was led by Chairman of the SLD, Leszek Miller.

194575.0,"Vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Administration and Internal Affairs, MP Marek W√≥jcik, pointed out at a press conference in the Sejm that the government is trying to convince the public with media gestures that it is trying to control the appetite of PiS activists for jobs in State Treasury companies and other public institutions. ""The truth is different - every day the Sejm is working on bills that will create new political bases for Law and Justice activists,"" he reported. An example of such a ""ground for PiS activists"" - as he pointed out - is the draft amendment to the Act on government administration departments, which concerns the Ministry of Maritime Economy. Currently, work on it is underway in the Parliamentary Committee on Administration and Internal Affairs. ""This bill sounds innocent, it is supposed to concern maritime economy, but in practice these changes are hidden behind changes in regulations that create new positions for +PiSiewicz+, new positions that will fall to the political prey of Law and Justice"" - noted Marek W√≥jcik. MP Tadeusz Aziewicz noted that the draft amendment regarding the Ministry of Maritime Economy is a ""leap into further functions in the management of seaports"". As he explained - according to PiS's proposal - the chairman of the supervisory board of a given company will be decided by the majority of the board, and since the majority of the board in these companies is owned by the State Treasury, the appointment of the positions will be decided by ""de facto PiS committees"". _x000D__x000D_

 The draft amendment to the Act on government administration departments, which applies to the Ministry of Maritime Economy, assumes, among others, strengthening competences, as well as introducing supervision of the Minister of Maritime Economy over maritime schools. The justification for the project emphasized that it provides for the creation of legal instruments for the minister necessary to properly perform the tasks entrusted to him. The changes concern, among others: establishing the general competence of the Minister of Maritime Economy as the minister exercising powers in institutions belonging to the State Treasury in such areas as maritime economy, inland navigation and fisheries. The Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation was established on December 8, 2015 after separating the maritime economy department from the then Ministry of Infrastructure and Development and after separating the fisheries department from the Ministry of Agriculture. inl/pap",no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,"partisan_state_label: The text criticizes political tactics but does not claim state institutions irrationally favor a specific group.

190586.0," PiS and the group of European Conservatives and Reformists oppose the planned changes in the financing of the EU budget. They are controversial and unfavorable for Poland - emphasizes PiS MEP Ryszard Czarnecki. At the end of February, the heads of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council announced the establishment of a joint group that will propose a reform of the EU's own resources system. The head of the so-called the high-level group was the former Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Monti. It includes representatives of EU countries, the European Commission and the European Parliament. The preliminary results of the group's work are to be known at the end of this year, and the full report will be presented in 2016, on the occasion of the review of the multi-annual EU budget for the period 2014-2020. As he informed at the Monday conference Ryszard Czarnecki in the Sejm, the changes are not accepted by PiS and the EKR faction in the European Parliament, to which the party belongs. ‚ÄúThis proposal seems controversial. We do not want Poles, being one of the poorest countries, to finance the EU until we achieve an appropriate level of wealth, the level of GDP per capita,"" he emphasized. Ryszard Czarnecki noted that PiS does not accept the suggested sources of the EU's own revenues, including: basing them on fees for CO2 emissions, as well as on new tax proposals for companies. ‚ÄúPutting another European tax would reduce competitiveness. ""Clearly, this seems to be a lame and completely pointless proposal,"" he said. Currently, the EU budget's own resources come from customs duties and sugar levies, part of VAT revenues in EU countries and, above all, from contributions from Member States, which means that Each time, the EU budget is agreed through long and fierce negotiations between governments. Already in 2010, Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski proposed considering new sources of funding the EU budget, e.g. from a tax on financial transactions, revenues from trading in CO2 emission rights, by taking over part of the VAT (e.g. a few percentage points) or CIT, tax in the form of the so-called air transport fee and energy tax.

198605.0," We publish the statements of SLD chairman Leszek Miller at a joint conference with former president Aleksander Kwasniewski regarding the US Senate report on torture used by the CIA.¬†Either defenseless citizens or Islamic terrorists. Is it the interest of the Polish state to defend victims or murderers? Should you participate in the anti-terrorist coalition? Is there no such need? Polish victims did not end with the attack on the WTC. After New York, there was London, Madrid, and then other parts of the world. Recently, a Polish engineer was brutally murdered by the Taliban. This is a test of how Polish politicians approach the greatest threat that currently exists in the world: the Islamic state and the consequences of its functioning.¬†It's worth remembering that this report doesn't change anything. Then we have Islamic terrorism, murdered women and children, churches and mosques blown up, and the spread of industrial genocide on an unprecedented scale. On the other hand, we have us, people of Western civilization, whom Islamic murderers want to destroy. ¬†Either we defend ourselves or we don't. This division exists independently of this report.¬†¬†The report is a political game of American senators. It is not that we are dealing with a report of the American Senate. We are only dealing with a part of it that, on the altar of its internal political fight, does not hesitate to use an argument that weakens the United States and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism around the world. For this reason, we feel disgusted that the intensity of this fight before the upcoming elections in the United States is pushing some American politicians to such practices.¬†Today in the USA, terrorists are not interrogated or tortured. Today they are being killed outright. US President Barack Obama, the administration and the Democratic majority of Congress emphasize that the American president has ended the intensified interrogation procedure. Probably yes, but he used a different one. Currently, suspected terrorists are not interrogated or subjected to torture. Suspects are simply killed - without trial or sentence, using drones. During President Obama's term, 3,500 people were killed in this way. people, at least 500 of them are civilians. The drone does not know the concept of human rights, it only kills entire families and all random people who are within its range. It amazes me that organizations defending human rights have nothing to say, and that there is complete silence on this subject in Poland as well. Are the procedures used in the past bad and those in force today good? Is this what the American sense of right and wrong is supposed to be? We need to talk about it because it's not like something has disappeared. Some procedures have been replaced by others.¬†The Polish side did not participate in the interrogations. No Polish intelligence agency officer is suspected of using torture. This thing does not concern Poland, Polish secret services or any Polish citizen at all. Poland continues to cooperate with the United States in the anti-terrorist coalition. President Bronislaw Komorowski knows what methods are currently used by the American administration in the fight against terrorism - methods that do not involve any courts or judgments. In the case of Osama Bin Laden's capture, he was not transported to the USA, but shot on the spot. Does the current leadership of the Polish state have any doubts in this matter or does it accept these procedures?¬†The question about future cooperation with the USA Whether the disclosure of this report will affect Polish-American relations is a question for Prime Minister Kopacz and President Komorowski. I know that this will correct the relations between the secret services. The problem for the United States will be that it must continue to fight terrorism, and every special service of any country that is asked to do so will wonder whether it is worth building a coalition without the United States. ¬†Today we are discussing the budget law. It is embarrassing that the Polish government presents a budget bill to MPs for discussion where the expenditure on special services, especially the Intelligence Agency, is so low. If conclusions are to be drawn from what happened, a profound correction should be made. We would gladly accept the president's legislative initiative in the Sejm, which would result in the services fighting terrorism receiving greater powers.¬†You cannot reveal secret things.¬†When we started our office, we were given certificates that we were included among NATO's highest-ranking officers. And because of this, we are obliged to keep the secret of Cosmic Top Secret. We are not looking for an apology from the United States, we did everything we could do at that time. Various conclusions can be drawn from this situation. But my conclusion is this: citizens of the Republic of Poland should be sure that wherever they are attacked in the world, the Polish state will not forget about them and will do everything to ensure that such situations do not happen again and that the perpetrators are punished. If the Polish authorities evade such obligations, they do not deserve to rule in Poland. Every Pole who is touched by anyone must know that the Polish state will come for his aggressor.

184563.0,"The implementation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Fourth Polish Republic requires a new constitution. Law and Justice understands the Fourth Polish Republic as a critical continuation of the Third Polish Republic. It is necessary to preserve what has worked in the Third Polish Republic - it serves the development of Poland and the freedom of its citizens. What needs to be overcome is what deprives the state of the coherence necessary to conduct ambitious development policy, limits the subservient role of public authorities towards the needs of citizens and the national interest, favors pathologies. The transition from the Third to the Fourth Polish Republic will not be a revolution, but a gentle evolutionary process with the predominance of elements of continuity. A new emphasis in constitutional axiology and changes in some political structures However, they are so numerous and significant that it would not be advisable to amend the 1997 Constitution, but it is advisable to replace it with the new Constitution of the Republic of Poland. The current draft constitution, prepared by Law and Justice at the turn of 2009 and 2010, refers to the draft presented by parties in 2005. Modifications and additions result from reflections and experiences of the past five years - both in internal relations and in the international situation. In particular, they are related to the new stage of development of the European Union, initiated by the Treaty of Lisbon, and also to the fact that that the largest country in the European Union, Germany, through changes to its constitution and legislation, has unprecedentedly strengthened its position as a member of the European Union. The message of the Law and Justice project can be summarized in the formula: strengthening the cohesion, reliability and honesty of the state so that it is able to defend the freedom of citizens and help them meet their needs, and ensure Poland's modern development and its rightful place in Europe and the world. Axiological accentsThe concise preamble refers to the invocatio Dei in the monumental constitutions of the free Republic of Poland: the Constitution of May 3, 1791 and the March Constitution of 1921. and to the Christian heritage of the Nation. This does not prejudice the equality of all people regardless of their worldview and religion (Article 19, section 1) and freedom of conscience, worldview and religion (Article 27, section 1). The project emphasizes the value of the national community - irreducible to sum of citizens, including past, present and future generations of Poles, understood as an environment for the development of a person (preamble, art. 2). At the same time, citizens belonging to national minorities are guaranteed equal treatment and minority rights (art. 19, section 1, art. 40) .The project continues the constitutional trend of affirming the family, and therefore marriage, defined, of course, as the union of a woman and a man, as well as motherhood and parenthood (Article 4, section 1, point 3). It clearly exaggerates that possible non-marital intimate relationships are a purely private matter of those involved in them. persons and remain beyond the scope of interest and interference of public authorities (Article 30(2)). The project maintains and even strengthens the existing guarantees of protection of the individual against unjustified state interference in the political and economic sphere, criminal repression or public levies. However, unlike the constitution The Third Polish Republic, which in a hyperliberal spirit assumes that the main threats to the individual are related to the activity of public authorities, the project also emphasizes the positive obligations of the state. It should make efforts aimed at the good of citizens. The most important tasks of public authorities in the internal sphere are the protection of citizens from attacks on their life, health, freedom and property (Article 4(1)(1)) and ensuring consistency and reliability in the activities of institutions and public figures, based on compliance with the law and good customs as well as appropriate qualifications and personal honesty, ruthlessly combating disregard for the law and abuse of power by public officials (Article 4(1)(2). The task of the state, emphasized in the constitution, is also, among other things, creating conditions for rapid economic and civilizational development of the country, development of domestic entrepreneurship, dissemination and protection of citizens' property and fair competition ( art. 4, section 1, point 4), as well as promoting the vitality of rural areas and an agricultural system based on a family farm (art. 4, section 1, point 5). The above-mentioned tasks of public authorities and their tasks in the sphere of broadly understood social policy (art. 4 points 6-12) cannot be, as in the Third Polish Republic, empty constitutional declarations on which practical politics is left to the agenda. They are the subject of a serious public debate every year due to information from the Council of Ministers on the status of implementation of these tasks (Article 4 section 2), as well as due to the assessment made by the President of the Republic of Poland in his annual address on the state of the country (Article 71 section 2). In this way, the thinking and actions of the highest state bodies will be focused on matters important to citizens, determining their everyday life and the future. The project clearly emphasizes the principle of monopoly of public authorities in the use of coercive measures (Article 11, section 3). This principle, frequently violated in the practice of the Third Polish Republic, is treated by the project initiators as one of the guarantees of equal access of citizens to the basic good of personal security and property security, as well as compliance with the law in the sphere of protection of these goods. The project recognizes the formal continuity of the Polish statehood after World War II, however, it departs from the axiological neutrality towards the ideology and totalitarian practices of the Polish People's Republic, typical of the current constitution. Disapproval of them is expressed both in the preamble and in specific provisions regarding: the prohibition of creating organizations based on the ideology of communism (as well as fascism and Nazism ‚Äì Article 12(3); counteracting the presence in public places of content and symbols expressing praise for the ideology and practices of communism (Article 29); recognizing the right to full knowledge about the evil practices of communism as a constitutional citizen's right (Article 35); granting constitutional rank to the Institute of National Remembrance (Article 173), disregarding the oath taken by current public officials back in the times of the Polish People's Republic, in the spirit of communist ideology (Article 191); removal from the judiciary of judges who, during the times of the Polish People's Republic, had violated the principle of judicial independence (Article 192). The status of the individual, contained in Chapter II, the catalog of constitutional freedoms and personal and political rights in the broad sense, including guarantees in the sphere of criminal and tax law, essentially corresponds to catalog contained in the constitution of the Third Polish Republic and international standards. The clause according to which the freedoms and rights guaranteed in the constitution cannot be abused to attack the legal order or to benefit from violating the law (Article 17(3)) is only a confirmation of the implicit principle in every system of legal protection of human and citizen rights, also formulated in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Tribunal. A similar clarification is that the prohibition of violating statutory restrictions on the exercise of statutory freedoms and rights does not apply to penalties and preventive measures imposed by the court (Article 17 section 2, second sentence). The new constitutional subjective rights are: the right to protect the presence of cultural and religious symbols and memorabilia existing in the public sphere in accordance with local customs (Article 28), the right to request the removal of content and symbols praising ideology from public places or practices of communism, fascism or Nazism (Article 29) and the right to compensation for damage to health or property suffered in connection with the active defense of the legal order against unlawful attacks (Article 50). Citizen's right to information about the activities of public authorities and public institutions is indirectly expanded through a restrictive definition of the boundaries of the sphere of classified information (Article 34(2)). In the current political and economic situation, a certain difficulty is the fair and real inclusion in the basic law of the issue of social rights, understood as the right to benefits for the individual from institutions public. The Constitution of the Third Polish Republic is characterized in this area by a fa√ßade reminiscent of communist constitutions: the social guarantees contained therein are largely fictional, and politics and public authorities, including courts, ignore them as a matter of course. The provisions on social rights contained in constitution of the Third Polish Republic or are openly not observed in practice (e.g. Article 68, section 2, declaring ""equal access to health care services financed from public funds"" for all citizens), or due to their wording, they have no practical significance (e.g. Article 81, which states that social rights specified in earlier articles may be ""claimed within the limits specified in the law"", i.e. the constitution supposedly guarantees something that in fact it does not guarantee. In an attempt to break out of this circle of fiction, the project tries to honestly demarcate it , what can be guaranteed directly in the constitution, from what can be specified at the level of ordinary legislation, adapted to current needs and the possibilities of meeting them. Firstly, the guarantee of universal availability of education in public schools other than higher education will be of a directly constitutional nature. Principles of accessibility education in public universities is to be regulated by law (Article 38, sections 4 and 5). At the same time, the new constitution will directly guarantee free education in all public schools. This constitutional guarantee will also apply to education in public universities; the act may only allow for payment of some additional educational services provided by these schools. This approach should put an end to the practice of parallel organization of free studies and paid studies with an identical or similar curriculum in state universities. The wording of the proposed article 38, section deserves to be emphasized in this connection. .5.It differs from the wording of Article 71(2) of the 1997 Constitution, which allows for payment of ""certain educational services"", without specifying that only additional (extra-curricular) services may be covered; This inconsistency enabled in practice a massive expansion of paid studies at state universities, contrary to the declared intentions of some creators of the constitution of the Third Polish Republic. Secondly, the proposed constitution includes a guarantee for all citizens of access to health services financed from public funds. Its implementation is to be achieved by maintaining and developing by the authorities of the public health care institution system (Article 51). By formulating the obligation to maintain and develop public health care institutions, the project expresses a tendency diametrically opposed to the concept of privatization of hospitals and other public health care facilities. Finally, the project defines the directions of statutory social guarantees in eleven other areas (Article 52). To the extent that the proposed constitution in the sphere of social rights assumes specifying their content in statutes, it is necessary to create a systemic mechanism guaranteeing the reality of the legislator's obligations in this area. In order to move away from the situation in which practical politics ignores the constitutional obligations of the state towards citizens in the sphere of broadly understood social policy, the proposed regulation imposes the Council of Ministers is obliged to submit to the Sejm detailed information on the state of legislation and its implementation in particular areas (Article 53). Together with the above-mentioned mechanism for controlling the implementation of basic state tasks (Article 4, paragraph 2), this mechanism will support a constant public debate on the state of social policy and broadly understood social rights. The safety of citizens in matters of their freedoms and rights guaranteed in the constitution and laws will be supported by the activities of the Ombudsman, which, unlike the concept of this office adopted in the Third Polish Republic, will be focused on specific assistance in individual cases violation of freedoms or rights by public authorities or harm or threat of criminal acts (Article 169). This office will therefore be an ombudsman for citizens most in need of help. Pursuant to the laws, the offices of the Ombudsman for Children and other ombudsmen specialized in particular areas will be able to operate (Article 170 ).Following the example of some other democratic countries, the drafter proposes a model of a universal constitutional complaint, which may be directed directly against any action or omission of public authorities violating the constitutional guarantees of the complainant's freedom and rights. In this mode, the Constitutional Tribunal will also have the ability to annul unconstitutional court judgments. and administrative decisions and responding to omissions of public authorities that harm an individual, and not only, as before, control of abstract legal provisions. A complaint in a specific individual case will be able to be submitted by an interested person, and with his or her consent, the Ombudsman will be able to do so (Article 132 ).The President of the Republic of Poland as a guarantor of coherence and high standards of state policy. The project preserves the parliamentary and cabinet system. Unlike the constitution of the Third Polish Republic, it clearly recognizes the Prime Minister as the head of the executive (Article 7, section 2). It retains the existing set of attributes of the power of the Prime Minister and government, enriching it with the right, characteristic of the so-called chancellor system, to give other members of the government binding guidelines in matters of implementing state policy (Article 109, section 3). The strengthening of the position of the Prime Minister as the head of government is also facilitated by the abandonment of the institution of a vote of no confidence by the Sejm against individual ministers. .Only the Prime Minister will be politically responsible before the Sejm for the government's activities (Article 113). At the same time, the project opposes the tendency to marginalize the role of the President of the Republic of Poland, reducing it to formal and symbolic activities. The designer recognizes that it is important to ensure the cohesion of the state and the reliability of the actions of all its institutions and their subservient nature towards the common good and the good of citizens, there is a need for the existence of the office of the President of the Republic of Poland equipped with a strong democratic mandate and appropriate instruments of action. In order to implement his role specified in Article 7, section 1, the President of the Republic of Poland will acquire specific competences in relation to the legislative power. , executive and judicial. These competences will not violate the independence of these authorities. At the same time, however, they enable the President to interfere, especially in the operation of the parliamentary-cabinet system, in the name of the basic interests of the state and citizens, and on the other hand, enable him to effectively support this system, if on the side of the government will be willing to cooperate with the President for the good of the state and its citizens. According to the project, such new instruments of the head of state include: a)¬†¬† ¬†determining, in cooperation with the Council of Ministers and with the help of the State Strategy Council, the strategic directions of state policy (Article 71(1)(1) 1, Art. 75, section 2), which will constitute a periodic specification of the principles and objectives expressed in Articles 2-4; b)¬†¬† ¬†applying to the Sejm and Senate with an annual address on the state of the state (Art. 71, section 2) ; c)¬†¬† ¬†impacting the civil service system, which will include officials of the Chancellery of the President, government administration and local government (Article 71, section 1, point 10); d)¬†¬† ¬†chairing the Council for the Judiciary (Article 148(1)) and ‚Äì in extreme cases ‚Äì removing discredited persons from the administration of justice (Article 145(2), Art. 192);e)¬†¬† ¬†the right to refuse to appoint the Prime Minister or another member of the Council of Ministers if there are contraindications specified in the constitution (Article 122); f)¬†¬† ¬†issuing regulations with force of law at the request of the Council of Ministers, requiring approval by the Sejm to enter into force (Article 62); g)¬†¬† ¬†the right to represent Poland in negotiations with representatives of other countries and in international organizations based on the political position determined by the Council of Ministers (Article 73); the nation expressed in a referendum on a controversial act (Article 103, paragraph 1); i) the right of privileged legislative initiative based on the result of the referendum (Article 105). The above solutions will not remove responsibility for policy from the parliamentary-government system. A confrontational course towards head of state, however, would involve a high political risk for the government. However, with the will to cooperate for the good of the state and its citizens, it will be possible for the President to effectively support the government. Sejm and Senate. Electoral system The Sejm and Senate will remain universally elected legislative chambers, although their structure will change certain modifications. In the case of the Sejm, the most important change is the reduction of the number of Deputies to 360 (Article 90) and the possibility of shortening the term of office of the Sejm by the President also in cases of discrepancies between the current preferences of the Nation expressed in the presidential elections and the ""old"" composition of the Sejm (Article 94, section 2 point 1) or discrepancies between the will of the Nation expressed in the referendum and the legislative actions or omissions of the Sejm (Article 103, section 3, Article 105, section 3). In the case of the Senate, the proposed changes are more profound. It will retain its existing competences in the legislative process, but to a greater extent than before there will be a chamber of state reflection over current politics. The length of the Senate's term of office will no longer be related to the term of office of the Sejm, but will be harmonized with the term of office of local government bodies (Article 96 and 194). The statutory number of senators will be reduced to 50 people ( Article 95, section 1). Only persons with at least five years of experience in performing public functions will have the right to vote in the Senate (Article 32, section 3). In addition, persons who have held public office in the past will be able to sit in the Senate ex officio. voters, the office of the President of the Republic of Poland (Article 95(2) and (3)). The Senate and its Marshal will gain some new organizational, creative and control powers (Article 71(2), Article 77(2), 78(2), Art. 89, art. 128, paragraph 3, art. 141, art. 161, paragraph 2, art. 166 and 167, art. 169, paragraph 2). The project exaggerates the majoritarian nature of the electoral system and meets the demand for single-member districts in terms of elections. to the Senate. As far as elections to the Sejm are concerned, the project remains in line with the current principle of proportionality, the specific shape of which will be determined by the electoral law (Article 10 sections 2 and 5). The end of corporatism The project puts an end to the disease of public life of the Third Polish Republic, which is corporatism that is harmful to citizens' freedom and the common good. This phenomenon occurs under the banner of self-government, although with the properly understood idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlocal government as a form of decentralization of public power, does not have much in common. It is a form of autonomization of particular interests vis-√†-vis the state, the creation of privileged professional clans, entry to which is limited through procedures of a kind of co-optation. According to the project, professional, economic and similar self-governments, which may exist in the public law sphere to the extent that it deems it is appropriate for the legislator, they cannot violate not only the freedom to undertake a business activity, but also the freedom to choose a profession (Article 9(2)). If the legislator so desires, professional self-governments will be able to supervise the exercise of professions of public trust, but pursuant to constitution, they will lose the right to independently admit themselves to practice their profession (Article 43, section 2). All local governments will be subject to state supervision in the general interest (Article 9, section 3). Moreover, the project breaks with the quasi-corporate character of two critical segments of the state apparatus: justice and the prosecutor's office. Judges and prosecutors will retain all the attributes necessary to act reliably, legally and impartially, but they will no longer be treated as corporations autonomous from the democratic state, engaged in their own affairs, to the detriment of the efficiency of acting in the interest of the state and citizens. The recent exclusion of the prosecutor's office from the system of public authorities state based on the separation of powers took place by statute, without sufficient constitutional support. The project clearly exaggerates that the prosecutor's office will again be an instrument of the government in combating crime, and it will again be headed by the Minister of Justice as the Prosecutor General (Article 108(3)(6) , art. 195). Without prejudice to the principle of judicial independence, the project changes the structure of the body deciding on the nominations and promotions of judges: the place of the National Council of the Judiciary, which in the Third Polish Republic is a sui generis representative of the judges' corporation towards the democratic state, will be replaced by the Council for the Judiciary, which will be a professional body of a democratic state, independent of the government, in matters of judicial personnel, chaired by the President of the Republic of Poland (Articles 147‚Äì149). The project maintains the principle of judge irremovability and the application of disciplinary sanctions against judges exclusively by disciplinary courts (Article 145(1)). However, experience tells us to also take into account cases of incompetence or bad will that cannot be classified as individual disciplinary torts, but will continually prove the harm of leaving a given person in the judicial service. An extraordinary measure of response by a democratic state in such cases will be removal from office by the President of the Republic of Poland at the request of the Council for the Judiciary (Article 145, section 2). Supremacy of the constitution. Constitutional Tribunal The draft emphasizes the supremacy of the constitution in the entire state order of the Republic of Poland more strongly than the constitution of the Third Polish Republic (preamble, Article 11, section 1, art. 60, section 3, art. 127, art. 174, section 2). The designer is convinced that maintaining and strengthening this supremacy is a condition for Polish national identity, maintaining the sovereign and democratic character of the Polish State, realizing the national interest and protecting freedom and rights of citizens. Compliance with the constitution and respect for its supremacy must be ensured by appropriate institutional guarantees. For these reasons, the role of the Constitutional Tribunal will be increased. It will not be one of many bodies of judicial power, listed in the constitution in a further order than the courts, but will be the supreme body of the judicial power of the Republic of Poland. , which has the power to overturn unconstitutional decisions of all other bodies of power, including courts. The sole basis for the Tribunal's operation will be the Polish constitution, and the sole purpose of its operation is to ensure the supremacy of the constitution in the legal order of the Republic of Poland (Articles 125 and 127). Number of judges of the Tribunal will be increased to 18 (Article 128(1). The scope of the Tribunal's competences will be modified in a way that will increase the possibility of adjudicating on various disputes regarding compliance with the constitution. In the field of control of legal norms, the Tribunal will also be able to adjudicate on the constitutionality of law-making acts originating from an international organization to which the Republic of Poland transferred some competences of state authorities, in particular EU regulations and directives (Article 129(1) 1 point 3). The new competence of the Tribunal will be to resolve disputes between constitutional bodies of the state regarding the interpretation of the constitution, arising in the practice of operation of these bodies (Article 130). As already mentioned above, the project adopts a much broader structure of an individual constitutional complaint than before (Article 130). .132). A structure analogous to an individual constitutional complaint will be a municipal constitutional complaint, available to local government units (Article 133). Following the example of constitutional courts in other countries, the Tribunal will be empowered to temporarily suspend the application of the acts questioned before it until the dispute regarding their compliance is finally resolved. with the constitution (Article 131). The ""European"" chapter in the constitution. After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the nature of Poland's membership in the European Union, expressed in the scope and intensity of the impact of EU regulations on legal relations in the country and the complexity of decision-making processes with the participation of Polish representatives in institutions EU, has achieved a quality that could not be expected by the creators of the constitution of the Third Polish Republic in 1997. This act regulates only, in one article, a specific procedure for expressing consent to the transfer of certain competences to an international organization of the EU type (Article 90, the equivalent of the proposed Art. 174 and 175), however, does not regulate the shaping of the will of the Republic of Poland in matters of EU decisions made within the framework of concluded treaties. The manner in which these issues are regulated in the internal law of a member state - starting from the regulations of its legislative chambers, through legislation, usually to the fundamental law - depends both on the behavior of the sovereign and the democratic nature of the state, as well as its negotiating power in the EU forum. This was perfectly explained by the German Federal Constitutional Court in its famous judgment on the Treaty of Lisbon of June 30, 2009. The ""Treaty-around"" amendment to the German constitution and the German ""Treaty-around"" laws ensured that the local chambers legislative, significant - not only opinion-giving, but also constitutive - participation in shaping this country's position on the forum of the European Union. Articles 176-178 of the new Constitution of the Republic of Poland proposed in the Law and Justice project of the new Constitution of the Republic of Poland refer to the ""treaty-related"" legislative solutions adopted in the Federal Republic of Germany, taking into account the Polish specificity systemic. The proposed Chapter XIII will apply mainly in matters related to Poland's membership in the European Union and therefore may be called the ""European"" chapter. From the formal and legal point of view, however, its meaning is more universal - the provisions contained therein will apply to every case of transfer certain competences of state bodies of the Republic of Poland to any international organization or any international body. This is reflected in the title of this chapter. Modifications in the law-making process The project envisages a return to the category of a constitutional act, i.e. a legislative act having the force of the Constitution, adopted in a special procedure. A constitutional act will be able to introduce changes to the wording of the constitution, as well as establish constitutional regulations of an adaptive or transitional nature. The Council of Ministers will also have the initiative in this respect, which may be useful, e.g. in cases of conflict between Polish law and EU law (Articles 61, 189 and 190). .In terms of the parliamentary legislative procedure, the project contains mainly three types of novelties: Firstly, the President of the Republic of Poland will be equipped with the already mentioned right of special legislative veto and the sui generis right of privileged legislative initiative, in both cases related to the institution of referendum (Article 103 and 105). .Secondly, the project assumes the exclusive initiative of the Council of Ministers in matters of laws relating to the ratification of international agreements and determining the position taken by the Republic of Poland on the EU forum (Article 65(2), Art. 177(2)). Thirdly, the Council of Ministers will be equipped with the sui generis right of privileged legislative initiative, consisting in the possibility of stipulating that amendments to a government bill require its consent (Article 106(1)), which, of course, will not prevent the rejection of the bill by the Sejm or the bill adopted by it by the Senate This solution will serve to speed up the legislative process and counteract the ""corruption of the law"". The same purpose will be served by the above-mentioned regulations having the force of law, issued by the President of the Republic of Poland at the request of the Council of Ministers, announced and implemented with the consent of the Sejm (Article 62). The above institutions of ""privileged"" legislative initiative of the Council of Ministers and regulations having the force of law make, in the opinion of the draftsman, unnecessary to maintain the institution of an urgent legislative procedure in the new constitution. However, nothing prevents certain elements of such a procedure from being introduced under the regulations of the legislative chambers. Both new law-making institutions will also be sufficient for the efficient implementation of the obligations arising from the Republic of Poland's membership in the European Union in Polish legislation, while maintaining democratism and open law-making. Therefore, the draftsman firmly rejects the proposal to introduce the institution of the so-called national European regulations, which would be issued by the government. or individual ministers directly on the basis of EU directives, bypassing the Sejm and the President of the Republic of Poland. New offices and institutions of constitutional rank. As already mentioned, the National Council of the Judiciary will be replaced by the Council for the Judiciary, with a changed shape and tasks (Articles 147-149 and 197). The National Broadcasting Council will replace the Office for Electronic Media (Articles 172 and 197). The constitutional rank will be given to: the State Treasury Solicitor's Office (Article 162, sections 2-4), public radio and television institutions (Article 171) and the Institute National Remembrance (Article 173). Within 6 months of the entry into force of the new Constitution, the organization of the civil service and the prosecutor's office will be statutorily adjusted to the already mentioned constitutional changes regarding the civil service and the prosecutor's office (Article 195).Th",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text debates policy choices without irrationally claiming state bias toward any particular group.

190557.0," Yesterday, Prime Minister Tusk and Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak visited the Coastal Missile Division of the Navy in Siemirowice in the Pomeranian Voivodeship and, as usual in such cases, he was accompanied by journalists from friendly media (the Prime Minister is convenient to travel a little close to home every Monday, he does not have to travel in the morning get up and go to work in Warsaw). He can say to them whatever comes to his mind, none of them will ask any sensitive question showing even the exceptional changeability of the head of government's views on the most important matters concerning our country. Prime Minister Tusk said at an impromptu press conference a lot, but two issues draw attention: the issue of preparing our army to defend the borders and the gas dependence on Russia not only of Poland but of most European Union countries, especially Germany. In the first issue, Prime Minister Tusk directly said that thanks to his almost 7 years of governments, thanks to investments and technical thought, Poland is becoming increasingly stronger militarily, although experts in this field have no doubts that the soldiers who fought in successive contingents in Iraq and Afghanistan and the special units that the Polish army has are prepared for war. But even for these approximately 20,000 soldiers, Poland does not have fully modern weapons. Prime Minister Tusk probably forgot that just a few months ago his government proposed cuts in army spending in the amendment to the budget for 2013 by as much as PLN 3.5 billion and the coalition majority of the Platform and PSL adopted them. Although the expenditure of the Ministry of National Defense in 2013 was planned in the amount of over PLN 31 billion, the expenditure on new weapons amounted to approximately PLN 8 billion and the above-mentioned cuts basically entirely concerned these expenditures. Moreover, in close to During Donald Tusk's 6-year government, over PLN 10 billion less was allocated to financing the army than was required in the Act on the Financing of the Armed Forces, and these spending cuts largely came from the part allocated to the modernization of the army. In total, the spending cuts amounting to over PLN 10 billion mean such a situation. as if in the last 6 years, for 2 years only symbolic money was spent on the modernization of the army, and it is incredible cynicism of the Prime Minister that he did not even think about it. The second problem raised by Prime Minister Tusk is the gas dependence of Europe, including Germany, on Russia. The Prime Minister commented on ""The dependence of Germans on Russian gas may make the rest of Europe dependent on Russia. I will talk about how Germany is able to correct certain actions regarding the economy so that dependence on Russian gas does not paralyze Europe."" The head of government even announced that he would raise this topic during Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to Poland on Thursday. And what did Prime Minister Tusk do? and his government for the last nearly 7 years on this matter. He did not protest against the construction of the Northern Gas Pipeline, in fact he did not protest even when the pipes of this gas pipeline were laid at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, so that large gas carriers will have serious problems to reach the Gas Port in Swinoujscie, which is being built for nearly PLN 3 billion. At a press conference with Angela Merkel nodded to the head of the German government when she was asked about this problem and said that if the Nord Stream pipes really turn out to be a problem for Poland, then they will be sunk into the bottom of the sea (although everyone who knows at least a little about this issue knows perfectly well that If such an operation were to be carried out, the gas pipeline would have to be taken out of service for several months, and even Chancellor Merkel will not be able to do that. The Prime Minister knows perfectly well that none of the journalists accompanying him will critically evaluate his speech or raise any doubts ( especially since recently the Prime Minister only makes statements and often scolds journalists like children), so his impertinence reaches its zenith. Of course, everyone has the right to change their views and the Prime Minister changed his views 180 degrees on these two issues, but let him say at least in one sentence that However, he has been wrong in recent years.

190736.0," We publish the text of Jaroslaw Kaczy≈Ñski's speech during the parliamentary debate on the dismissal of Jan Olszewski's government on June 4, 1992. Mr. Speaker! Your Honor! Today's debate is not a debate about this or that government, it is not an ordinary debate - in a democracy, governments sometimes change often - it is a debate, despite these limitations, despite these 5 minutes, about Poland. This context from which we cannot escape, which has been created by events last hours, that's what decides. We cannot escape the fact that a large part of society will treat this act, which will soon take place, as an act directed against actions necessary from the point of view of the fundamental, fundamental interests of the state. No normal state can tolerate in its authorities, in its parliament, people in their structures who were essentially agents of foreign secret services. (Applause) And no explanations, no platitudes about the state's interest that have been uttered here, will change this fact. (Applause) No impressive majorities, no strange coalitions in which, for example, the liberal party joins with a party whose leader recently explained from this podium that economics textbooks written in Moscow - a bunch of nonsense - and textbooks written in the West are equally untrue. (Applause) Disputes between the president and the government were also mentioned in the justification for the motion to dismiss the government. Well, yes, there were such disputes. The only question is what was their cause. There is a question whether certain institutions, personalized institutions, should be assessed independently of the facts or in accordance with the facts. It seems that a large part of this House believes that they should be assessed independently of the facts. Well, we will never come to terms with this type of view, a view that harms democracy, that deprives the highest body in Poland today of the right to evaluate other state institutions. (Applause) Finally, the most important thing is the substantive assessment of this government. There were words of brutal criticism here. Certainly - I can agree with MP Nowina-Konopka - no one today is an experienced driver of this newly constructed car. That's definitely true. But if we take this truth into account, if we compare the achievements of this government with the achievements of previous governments, then excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but there is no reason to be ashamed here. We have already mentioned the economic situation, which is improving in some way. We were talking about a budget that was prepared without compromise and for which there is no alternative. There is a socio-economic plan by Jerzy Eysymontt, for which there is no alternative at the moment. It was certainly not the economic situation or economic policy that caused the attack on this government. There can be no doubt about this. We, Your Honor, have always been in favor of the government of a broad coalition, but if our colleagues from the Liberal Democratic Congress and the Democratic Union believed that this coalition was, in our opinion, intended to stop the reconstruction process or, I will use yes here, no your favorite word, decommunization of Poland, it was a misunderstanding, a big misunderstanding. In any case, we did not understand this coalition this way. We did not understand it this way because the decommunization process is a great, and one could say constantly increasing, need both in this country and in other post-communist countries. This is a process that can be co-organized by this House, about which this House can co-decide, but it is also a process that will be decided primarily by society; the society that watches us here; a society that will decide that - although we know who we are dealing with and we know that various measures can be used to stop this process, including so-called administrative measures - this process cannot be stopped. It has already started - over the last few months, and maybe especially over the last few days.

203885.0," During today's press briefing in the Sejm, MEP Janusz Korwin-Mikke referred to the recent decisions of US President Donald Trump. He pointed out that the 45th president of the United States began to quickly implement his election promises. ‚Äì¬†His Excellency Donald Trump made a lot of decisions in a short time. First of all, he reversed the decision of Mr. Barack Hussein Obama to grant $221 million to Palestine - said the president of Wolnosci, Janusz Korwin-Mikke. President Obama's administration transferred $221 million to Palestine in the last few hours of its work, as reported by the Associated Press, citing government officials. ‚Äì This is an extremely important matter. Mr. Barack awarded this money when he left office, literally at the last moment, and Donald Trump has now reversed these decisions. MEP Korwin-Mikke pointed out: Mr. Obama's decision was scandalous, but the step taken by HE Donald Trump is also scandalous.¬†He explained: ""Who will now believe in Mr. Trump's promises when it follows that the next US president may not keep them?"" Nevertheless, the state should keep its obligations. The President of Wolno≈õci also referred to the decree signed on Friday by Donald Trump. It provides for a 90-day suspension of issuing American visas to citizens of Muslim countries that have problems with terrorism, and this applies to citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. ‚Äì The decree not allowing immigrants to enter the United States is outraged by some citizens, but the majority of Americans are undoubtedly in favor of this solution, because immigrants commit numerous abuses of the social benefits system. This greatly outrages hard-working Americans, said President Korwin-Mikke. ‚Äì¬†The media in Poland clearly emphasize the signs of opposition of part of the American society against Donald Trump's decisions, but the vast majority of Americans support Mr. Trump in this matter. MEP Korwin-Mikke said: Mr. Barack Hussein Obama is a Muslim, hence his sympathy for Palestine, Arab countries, etc. President Trump, however, has a decidedly anti-Islamic position. ‚Äì The key to the immigrant problem is social benefits, which mean that instead of people who want to work, people who want benefits come to the country ‚Äì said Janusz Korwin-Mikke. He also added: ""In Poland, benefits are fortunately quite low, so they do not attract immigrants like honey."" If they were higher, we would have a huge crowd at the border. In the second part of the conference, President Korwin-Mikke answered a journalist's question regarding reprivatization. According to the media, the CBA detained 5 people today in this case, and the detained will be charged with, among others, of a corruption nature. ‚Äì I have no idea whether these people are guilty or innocent ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãsaid president Janusz Korwin-Mikke.¬†‚Äì Reprivatization is related to a very scandalous practice from the times of the Platform government. People who were entitled to the return of real estate did not receive this return, but people who gave bribes often stepped into their shoes and received these returns. This is a scandal that should be punished very severely. This causes reluctance to reprivatization as such, which is due to the lack of a reprivatization act (...). These things should have been sorted out at least 20 years ago. If this is not taken care of, you will be fishing in murky water. The question is whether these dishonest anglers were caught. ¬†We invite you to watch the conference (CLICK). In that case, Mr. Janusz wouldn't withdraw 500+?

194008.0," The key issue is the security of Poland and Europe, the most important goal is to strengthen NATO's eastern flank - said Minister of Foreign Affairs Grzegorz Schetyna in the Sejm. He assured support for Ukraine and the cooling of relations with Russia, as well as, among others, about the reaction to attempts to falsify Polish history. Grzegorz Schetyna presented the assumptions of Polish foreign policy in 2015. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs devoted a large part of his speech to the issue of Poland's security. He noted that the last few months had become a turning point for Europe, because - as he said - at that time, Europe's immediate surroundings had ""transformed into a great belt of instability"" encompassing Libya, Iraq and Syria in the south, and Ukraine in the east. ""The key issue for the future of Poland and Europe today is ensuring security. We strive to achieve this by using all instruments available to us. The most important among them is NATO,"" the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized. He noted that challenges such as the war in eastern Ukraine or the activities of the so-called The Islamic State has forced the transatlantic community to rebuild its potential. In this context, he mentioned the provisions of the Newport Pact summit and preparations for the NATO summit to be held in Warsaw in 2016. As Grzegorz Schetyna stated, Poland's most important goal remains to strengthen NATO's eastern flank. He informed that in 2015, about 10,000 soldiers from NATO countries will take part in military exercises in Poland, including about 3,000 American soldiers. ""We will also strive to increase the role and internationalization of units such as the Multinational Corps North-East in Szczecin and the emerging NATO Force Integration Unit. Poland will increase its role in the Alliance by engaging in the Immediate Reaction Force and the reform of the NATO Response Force,"" he assured. He emphasized that as part of the implementation of the Armed Forces modernization plan, Poland will spend over PLN 130 billion on armaments by 2022. He also spoke about the ""growing need to increase the military capabilities of the European Union."" The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assessed that ""the West finds itself in a state of confrontation with Russia, and the eastern part of the continent is threatened with a protracted conflict with unpredictable consequences."" In this context, he talked about the events in Ukraine, as well as the situation in Georgia and Moldova. ""The model of extensive development of Eastern European societies, avoiding reforms and stifled by corruption, has been exhausted. The source of instability is not the European perspective and reforms, but their lack. This was proven by Ukrainians who were ready to pay the price of their lives to put an end to corruption, contempt for the rule of law and inept governments that have not been able to make a modernization effort for two decades,"" said Grzegorz Schetyna. He emphasized that Poland supports the efforts of the international community to stop the expansion of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. As he noted, this applies to both mediation attempts and sanctions. He added that Poland considers it advisable to increase the presence of international observers in the conflict area. ""At the same time, we cannot rule out that in the event of another escalation of military operations, we will be forced, together with other countries assessing the situation as we do, to decide on stronger support for the Ukrainian state, including its defense,"" Schetyna said. He assured that Poland would continue to support the authorities in Kiev in carrying out reforms and described our country's assistance to Ukraine. He emphasized that ""a sovereign, democratic, pro-European and prosperous Ukraine is an element of the Polish raison d'√©tat."" ""We want to continue the process of historical reconciliation based on truth with Ukraine. We will not remain silent about our wrongs and Polish victims, including the Volhynian crime, but we do not close ourselves off to our neighbor's sensitivity. Today, Ukraine is creating its modern identity, including its historical one, which does not slow us down, however from a critical look at their own history. This is the duty of mature nations,"" he said. Grzegorz Schetyna emphasized that the Polish authorities do not perceive the recent adoption of four laws on historical policy by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine as a threat. ""I appeal to parliamentary clubs and groups not to use these issues in the ongoing election campaign. This will not be in line with the Polish raison d'√©tat,"" he said. He noted that Russian policy towards Ukraine, the information war being waged by Moscow, but also events in Russia itself, such as the murder of Boris Nemtsov, are of concern. ""It is with sadness that I note the cooling of relations with the Russian Federation, but there are important reasons for this,"" he said. Minister Schetyna pointed out that a gesture that did not serve our bilateral relations well and at the same time had a particularly political meaning was the refusal of entry to Russia to the Speaker of the Senate, Bogdan Borusewicz, who intended to participate in Nemtsov's funeral ceremonies. ""We are concerned about smear campaigns or projects aimed at causing confusion in the Polish information space,"" he said. ""The vision of Poles and Russians shaking hands in the spirit of the best traditions of Mickiewicz, Herzen and Sakharov clearly arouses concern in some circles in Moscow today. Regardless of recent events, we will work to reverse this trend and return to normal, good-neighborly relations between our countries"" - he stated. Grzegorz Schetyna emphasized that Poland is grateful to the Russian side for helping in the evacuation of Polish citizens from Yemen, for the opportunity to properly commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Smolensk catastrophe in Smolensk and the 75th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. ""But we do not accept the lack of progress regarding the return of the wreck of the Tu-154 plane to Poland or the construction of a monument to the victims of the Smolensk disaster. We treat the closure of these matters as a test of Russia's good will in relations with our country. Hoping for a solution to these issues, we maintain bilateral channels of cooperation from Russia,"" he pointed out. He described the situation in the Middle East and the Mediterranean as a great challenge for EU security. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that never before in modern history has the scale of illegal migration from the South been as great as last year. ""We cannot be indifferent when hundreds of people are dying right near our borders, as in the recent tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea, and thousands are waiting to be smuggled to Europe. We consider the most appropriate response to the challenges coming from North Africa to be effective, better adapted to the needs and opportunities of southern Africa. neighbors European Neighborhood Policy,"" he said. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also discussed Poland's relations with the EU and its most important partners, including the USA, Germany and France. According to Schetyna, in 2015 we will continue to be active participants in the discussion on EU reform, opposing attempts to create new divisions in the EU. He added that the financial and economic crisis showed the need for structural reforms that would allow for the restoration of stable economic growth. He recalled that when joining the EU, Poland decided to adopt the common currency and still maintains this commitment. ""With this in mind, we are taking part in shaping the new architecture of the euro zone. At the same time, I would like to assure you that the key criterion that will guide us when taking further steps will be the interest of Poles and the stability and predictability of this area,"" Schetyna said. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured that Poland consistently strives to strengthen the energy security of the country and the EU. Poland, he said, supports further diversification of the directions of gas imports to Europe, especially through cooperation with suppliers such as the Persian Gulf countries, Norway, the countries of the Caspian Sea region and the USA. The Minister of Foreign Affairs described the USA as a ""strategic military partner, one of the most important economic partners."" ""Polish-American economic relations are part of the economic partnership of the European Union with the United States, which we intend to jointly expand through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement,"" he announced. Germany - as Schetyna called it - is today Poland's main European partner. It is difficult to imagine the EU without the Polish-German partnership, he said. He informed that in four days the next Polish-German intergovernmental consultations will be held, during which, among others, the following will be signed: agreement on cooperation between police services. Grzegorz Schetyna also discussed strengthening the activity of our diplomacy in Asia, Africa and South America. ""The success of the Polish transformation of the last 25 years has made Poland an attractive international partner, Poland's role in shaping the EU's external policy obliges us to be more active also outside Europe, it is worth remembering that non-European markets hide enormous economic potential,"" he said. He also stated that Polish diplomacy will support the foreign expansion of Polish enterprises and attracting foreign investments. The minister devoted part of his speech to the situation of Poles living abroad. ""Polish diplomacy effectively provides support and care to the over 20 million Polish diaspora scattered all over the world,"" he said. He emphasized that aid for Poles in Belarus and Lithuania remains a priority. The head of Polish diplomacy also stated that the party would further deepen contacts with Lithuania Lithuanian specific actions to ensure compliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Treaty of 1994 in respect of the rights of ethnic minorities. He noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also working on the recognition of the rights of Poles living in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. Grzegorz Schetyna also spoke about the activity of his ministry in striving for the best possible image of our country. ""Recent events show that this is not a closed issue. I assure you that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been and will be active in this field,"" he argued. He assured that ""we will not be passive in the event of attempts to falsify history, ignorance or attributing to us faults that we have not committed."" ""Only last year, our diplomatic missions responded more than 150 times times when using the so-called faulty memory codes regarding Poland and Poles,"" the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs enumerated. He added that ""most of the interventions were effective and led to the correction of incorrect formulations."" The minister also recalled the figure of Jan Karski, emissary of the Polish Underground State, who informed the world about the Holocaust, but in the USA his report was written on page 16 of the New York Times, while the first page contained information about the governor of New York giving his sports shoes to a rubber warehouse. Grzegorz Schetyna emphasized that Polish diplomacy will continue to promote Karski and his achievements. , because it is ""the best way to break down harmful stereotypes about the history of our country."" He thanked Jewish organizations in the USA for their ""support in this matter, especially the American Jewish Committee and its head, David Harris.""",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,"partisan_state_label: The text factually reports government measures without irrational bias toward any group.

185720.0," A wonderful man who ran my parliamentary office brilliantly died. It was an office where you didn't practice politics so much as help people - says MEP Janusz Wojciechowski in an interview with ""Nasz Dziennik"".Piotr Czartoryski-Sziler: When did you receive the information that an assassin murdered your assistant in your parliamentary office in Lodz? Marek Rosiak and seriously injured MP Jaros≈Çaw Jagielly's assistant - Pawe≈Ç Kowalski? Janusz Wojciechowski: This tragic information found me in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. I was sitting at the computer, preparing for the votes that were about to start, and I was still working on the text of my blog entry, because yesterday I was outraged by the attacks on PiS, which were likened to the Communist Party of Poland, and discussions about the delegalization of PiS. When I was writing the text, this terrible news fell on me like a bolt from the blue. I perceived it primarily as a human being, because a wonderful man who ran my parliamentary office brilliantly had died. It was an office where you didn't practice politics so much as help people, because they came from all over Poland with various interventions. Over five hundred cases have been handled by this office since the beginning of his term. I didn't always have time to be there myself, but this office functioned very well all this time. Mr. Rosiak organized it. He was a very experienced man, sensitive and friendly to people, and three young people cooperated with him, including a legal advisor. It's hard to believe what happened.P.C.-S.: Do you think - like PiS president Jaroslaw Kaczynski - that what happened is the result of a campaign of hatred that has been carried out against PiS for a long time? Of course, it should be seen the background to this attack. I don't know what the sanity of the man who committed this crime is, but he was filled with hatred, he shouted hatred, he wanted to kill Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski - that's what he said. It turns out that the seed of hatred sown produced a bloody harvest. We need to remember all the words that were said about PiS, such as ""dorzynianie watah"". It is also worth recalling Mr. Palikot's statement here - when he was still in the Civic Platform, he said that Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski should be ""shot and gutted"". No one in the Platform has distanced itself from this. What happened in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ is the result of this campaign of hatred. P.C.-S.: ""Dorzynanie watah"" is entering the implementation phase? J.W.: Someone took these words literally and did what he did. However, I am dismayed to say that there is an immediate attempt to reverse this matter. There are already comments that PiS itself is to blame for what happened. This is no longer acceptable. I am trying to organize help in the European Parliament for the family of Mr. Marek Rosiak, who died at the police station. I don't know exactly how big his family is, I know his wife, who was the vice-president of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, she is even going to run in these elections to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship Assembly as a candidate of Law and Justice, I know that he also has a son. P.C.-S.: You could say, that Donald Tusk's words about ""mohair berets"" started this avalanche of hatred? J.W.: Yes, that was the beginning. Later, worse and worse words came from various people. Wladyslaw Bartoszewski called us ""cattle"". This is the climate from which aggression is only a step away, as it turns out, because emotions are already very tense. When I watch debates in the commercial media, they are always about PiS. When five topics are discussed during an hour-long program, four of them concern Law and Justice. What did Kaczynski say, why did he say something, why didn't he say something, and what would he say if... After all, it's still beating on one side. I remember morning political discussions on Radio Zet, during which all members of the meeting were beating up one MP, Mariusz Blaszczak. This is still a one-sided attack and attribution of the worst features of PiS. Let me also remind you of the campaign against MP Zbigniew Ziobro, who was accused of causing people to die because he detained a corrupt doctor. P.C.-S.: Has your MP's office received any threats before? J.W.: Never, on the contrary, many people came to him to express their thanks, best wishes. The office is open, anyone can enter it. This has been the case so far, today I don't know if it can continue like this, we will probably have to change something in the functioning of this office, because such an act of aggression does not have to be the last. Sometimes the law of series applies in this type of events... P.C.-S.: Are you afraid for your own safety today? J.W.: You know, I was a person who was never afraid. I was not afraid as a judge, even though I tried difficult cases of serious criminals. I was not afraid as the president of the Supreme Audit Office, because few people know, but I had no protection, even though I dealt with the most serious scandals. I was not afraid as a deputy speaker of the Sejm, and I did not benefit from any protection then. And until now I wasn't afraid either, but in this campaign of hatred I guess we'll have to be more careful about the people we come into contact with. After all, I could have been in this office at the time of the attack. P.C.-S.: According to the police, Ryszard C. had been in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ for four days and everything indicates that his attack was not spontaneous, but planned. In addition to a gun with live ammunition, he also had a knife and a stun gun. J.W.: I didn't know about it, I found out from you. This fact is even more terrifying. Please pay attention to the clamor when the issue of Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski's use of protection was raised and with what wild satisfaction this protection was taken away from him. Today we see how great the threat is. I can't imagine how, after everything that happened in the office in Lodz, you can start working there normally again, receiving and inviting people. I need to think about how my office will continue to function. I think it is impossible to provide such protection that would fully protect employees. This dramatic day changed a lot in the way we look at Polish politics. P.C.-S.: The campaign against PiS is only aimed at discrediting the group in the eyes of society, or is it about diverting attention from important issues in the country? J.W.: It is definitely also about diverting attention. from current problems. It is impossible to maintain power with the results of governance, because they are getting worse and worse and people can see it. The only way for the Civic Platform to win the next elections is to arouse irrational fear of PiS. I think that PO uses this method cynically. The Polish state is beginning to move towards some kind of totalitarianism, perhaps not on the scale of Stalinism, but certainly on the scale of Lukashenko. There is a desire for the leading party, i.e. the Civic Platform, and the allied parties - PSL and SLD - to be in power, and for PiS to be eliminated or weakened so much that it will not be able to win the next elections. P.C.-S.: You are suggesting that democracy in Poland is it at risk?J.W.: I think the line has been crossed. The political fight in Poland is no longer only a democratic fight, located in a normal, civilized, democratic world, where the authorities ""fight head to head"" with the opposition. I must also refer here to the court's punishment of ""Nasz Dziennik"" for writing that TVN is a ""slanderous station"". After all, this is the end of freedom of speech in Poland. The words written by ""Nasz Dziennik"" are an assessment with which you may agree or disagree, but a legitimate assessment that falls within the scope of freedom of speech. Every person has a right to it, especially a newspaper. If even such words are not allowed to be used in our country today, how can we talk about Polish democracy?

188017.0," PiS wants to refer the government's pension reform to the Constitutional Tribunal if it is adopted by the Sejm. PiS questions, among other things, scandalous - as he claims - mode of work on the project. PO argues that neither the project nor the procedure for working on it violate the constitution. On Wednesday, the head of the PiS club, Mariusz Blaszczak, announced that the reform would be referred to the Tribunal. As he said, the Sejm's work on pension projects is being carried out in a scandalous manner and violates the rules of legislation. ""If this bill is continued in this way and due to its substantive content, if it is adopted by the Sejm, the PiS club will submit an application to the Constitutional Tribunal,"" he emphasized. .PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told journalists in the Sejm that the Constitutional Tribunal ""repeatedly paid attention to the procedure for adopting laws."" ""I hope he will do the same in this case,"" he added. (...)Jaroslaw Kaczy≈Ñski argued that the European experience of recent weeks shows that those who want to shift the costs of the crisis onto economically weaker social groups, i.e. the majority of society, because the majority is always slightly weaker than the richest, pay for it - he noted Kaczynski. ""And they pay a high price for it,"" he added. ""Everyone sees the interests of certain capital groups here, even those related to NFI. This is completely obvious. We are dealing with an authority that was able to change laws so that one billionaire would not have to be held accountable,"" said PiS President. PiS MP Jaroslaw Zielinski complained at a press conference about the - in his opinion - scandalous manner of working on the laws. ""There was no time left to work on the texts, on amendments, social consultations were made impossible,"" he said. ""Donald Tusk wants these laws to be brutally pushed through the parliament before Euro 2012, so that during Euro 2012 it will all be over, so that the protests will end, as maybe some people - this is what the Prime Minister is counting on - already doubt the sense of these protests,"" the MP noted. As he added, it is also a ""gift"" for financial institutions that ""do not want to pay pensions from contributions."" ""In short, this is Prime Minister Donald Tusk's consent to allow financial institutions to continue to rob Poles, because the idea is for pensions to be paid later and shorter,"" he said. ""When we win the parliamentary elections, what do we believe in and what will happen , then we will abolish these laws,"" emphasized Zielinski. MP J√≥zefa Hrynkiewicz assessed at the conference that in Poland in 1997-2008 the social insurance system was basically abolished and replaced - she said - by a capital system. ‚ÄúThis is not social insurance, it is capital insurance. All norms were violated, both those in force in the European Union, the European Social Security Code, and our own constitution - Art. 67, which obliges the state to create a social insurance system,"" she emphasized. She noted that no one can predict how long he will work, in what health condition he will finish his work, or when he will finish it. ‚ÄúAnd that is why the principle of solidarity and reciprocity applies in the insurance system. The funded system is not suitable for social insurance,"" says the MP. ""We must return to the solidarity system of social insurance. This is our moral obligation, our civic duty,"" she appealed. During the conference, a short film ""The Truth about Pensions"" was presented. The animation presents the effects of applying the capital formula to the pension system. These include: a sharp reduction in pensions for all new retirees from 2014, burdening the finances of municipal governments with social assistance expenses for retirees, a significant decline in the level of consumption of retirees, a decline in GDP due to reduced consumption of retirees and widespread poverty of people living on pensions. The authors of the animation argue that the delay in retirement until the age of 67 proposed by the PO and PSL government does not solve any problem, but only shifts the responsibility for very low pensions onto retirees. In their opinion, until 2008, according to the solidarity system, we would receive a higher pension. Meanwhile, the amount of the pension from 2014 will be calculated by dividing the amount of payments to the Social Insurance Fund (and OFE) by further expected months of life, calculated as average life expectancy, jointly for women and men . ""This will lead to a drastic reduction in pensions, which will have little impact on the extension of working time, because at the same time life expectancy will increase"" - we hear in the film. According to the authors, the Polish reform of the pension system undertaken in 1997/98 and implemented since 1999 is an example of action when, in a poor country, the interests of large, mainly international financial corporations, triumphed over the interests of dispersed, poor and unorganized citizens.

189688.0," The PiS club wants the Sejm to adopt a resolution on solidarity with Hungarians in connection with the recent report European Parliament. The report, according to PiS, is a ""brutal attack"" on Hungary, and the EP had no right to accept it. The draft PiS resolution was submitted to the Sejm on Friday. The head of the PiS club, Mariusz Blaszczak, said at a press conference that the PiS draft is important because it concerns the ""philosophy of EU action"" and the changes taking place in the EU that are dangerous for our country and the entire EU. Referring to EP report on Hungary, Blaszczak assessed that ""before our eyes, the EU is moving away from the system that was introduced not so long ago by the Lisbon Treaty, which consists in the member states owning the Union."" ""Meanwhile, the EU is moving towards reversing these situations as if the Union had member states,"" the MP noted. In his opinion, ""with the passive attitude of our country's authorities, we are dealing with an attempt to deprive the member states of their independence in the EU."" Mariusz Blaszczak believes that we should react to this. PiS MP Jaroslaw Sellin explained that his party decided to prepare a draft resolution because ""no EU country has ever been attacked so brutally by the EP."" This refers to the EP report adopted on July 3. In it, MEPs criticized the constitutional reforms in Hungary and appealed to the authorities in Budapest to respect democratic values. The document was prepared by Portuguese Rui Tavaresa from the Green faction. The EP document contains approximately 40 recommendations for the Hungarian authorities. There was a call to remove from the constitution those provisions that were questioned by the country's constitutional court, as well as to limit constitutional reforms and to regulate areas such as family, social, fiscal and budgetary matters with ordinary laws. The document adopted by the EP, as Sellin said, it comes down to the fact that ""the EP, its majority, does not like the new constitution of Hungary, because it is based on certain axiological values ‚Äã‚Äãand these are Christian values."" ""We don't like the fact that marriage is recognized in this constitution as a union between a man and a woman,"" the MP emphasized. ""We cannot remain silent on this matter,"" said Jaros≈Çaw Sellin. In his opinion, other national parliaments should respond on this matter. ""We want us to be the first national parliament, apart from the Hungarian one, to issue its opinion on this matter and point out to the EP that it has exceeded its powers,"" said Jaros≈Çaw Sellin. ""This resolution is a violation of the principle of sovereignty,"" said the PiS MP. He emphasized that ""the spirit of the (EP) resolution is fundamentally leftist, and in this spirit Hungary was attacked."" Jaros≈Çaw Sellin said that the EP resolution also proves that ""the spirit of the doctrine of limited sovereignty is returning."" In his opinion, the Polish government should announce in advance that it will not agree to any ""executive actions against Hungary resulting from this resolution."" In the PiS draft resolution on the EP report it is written that ""the sharpness of such an attack, directed against Hungary today, may be unfair tomorrow hit every other EU member state."" ""We believe that this resolution is undue pressure, unnecessary pressure on sovereign Hungary, which is close to us,"" the draft says. ""We, Poles, cannot ignore the fact of violating the sovereignty and unequal treatment of Hungary under the law applicable in the European Union,"" we read. The draft emphasizes that ""EU institutions with a much weaker democratic mandate cannot question the sovereign policy of the member states, especially where it is an expression of the political will of the nation and does not affect the scope of community competences."" ""We see that the main reason for reservations against Hungary is its decisive implementation of sovereign policy, basing the new constitution on Christian values ‚Äã‚Äãand strengthening family rights. The Sejm of the Republic of Poland recognizes that such a policy is worth supporting, not condemning,"" the draft resolution wrote. It was emphasized that the European Parliament adopted a resolution ""to which it has no right"" and exceeded the scope of its powers mainly ""by arbitrarily setting requirements for one of the Member States of the European Union."" The draft reminded the European Parliament that ""the Hungarian National Assembly is not a parliament of local authorities subordinate to it, but a democratic representation of the proud Hungarian nation, which has made great contributions to Europe.""

198624.0," A few days before the second round of local government elections, a real storm rolled over the heads of the SLD - Miller met with Kaczy≈Ñski ! The ""outrage"" exceeded the limits of hysteria. Apparently, someone thought that the SLD could only move within the boundaries of its designated reservation. The meeting with Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski crossed these boundaries and therefore enraged the defenders of the so-called political correctness. They didn't notice that they were entering the zone of ridiculousness. I am different from Jaroslaw Kaczynski in everything, but PiS is not only Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Messrs. Blaszczak, Brudzinski and others. These are primarily 4 million Poles, our compatriots, who vote for PiS. Should I pretend they're not there? Are there any worse Poles? They have the same rights as PO or SLD voters. Poland is divided - to the east of the Vistula, PiS performs better in elections, to the west, PO. Does this mean that we should build a wall along the Vistula River and put up fences to separate the ""better"" from the ""worse""? SLD has no intention of participating in constantly fueling the hostility of some Poles towards others. SLD will always support a policy in which one fights for one's interests using arguments, not epithets and invective. Therefore, we do not accept any territory that is trying to be assigned to us. I did not meet Mr. Kaczy≈Ñski at ""U Sowa i Przyjaci√≥≈Ç"", but in the Sejm, which is for this purpose, so that everyone can talk to everyone, even such declared opponents as SLD and PiS. Especially since there was a reason to talk. The essence of democracy - elections - has been mutilated, especially the result of the elections to provincial assemblies seems to be distorted. We are not saying that someone rigged the elections, we are saying that the result is questionable. After all, not only ours. Over 500 (!) election protests have been submitted to the courts, so let's not rush to judgments, because these elections are still not over. It's different with the elections of presidents, mayors and commune heads - here everything went smoothly, nothing happened. Our critics, eternal reviewers and owners of the only truth about what SLD can and what it is not allowed to do, were probably uncomfortable when it turned out It turns out that despite the anti-ESLD hysteria, our result is second only to PO in the ranking of presidential cities. The success of Krzysztof Matyjaszczyk, who defended the position of president of Czestochowa in good style, can be considered downright spectacular. It is also a telling example that the principle of secularism of the state can be successfully implemented in practice, while respecting mutual autonomy, and that there is no need to cling to the cassock, because people hold their president accountable not for his prayers, but for what he has done for them specifically.

193206.0,"- The formula of the United Right camp, although sometimes problematic, is also the source of our success. It is thanks to the diversity of views and the diversity of opinions that we are able to achieve victories, and thus exercise power, continue the march during which we are changing Poland - said PiS President Jaros≈Çaw Kaczynski in interview for Gazeta Polska. Mr. President, have we seen an attempt to implement a scenario that assumed blocking the elections, creating a new majority in the Sejm, and therefore - also overthrowing the United Right government? This is what the heads of SLD and the Platform seem to suggest. - I will answer with a well-known colloquial saying: what was and is not is not recorded in the register. But please do not interpret this answer as a confirmation of the reality of the scenario described by you. The United Right government can safely continue its mission, the presidential elections will be held before the deadline. term of office of the head of state and will be carried out in the safest way for voters, so I do not even want to enter into speculations about the motivations of certain people, especially since my trust in the two gentlemen mentioned a moment ago is, to put it mildly, extremely limited. However, it is today a matter much more important than any possible not very serious games and tricks. In the most radical of all cases so far, it turned out - I already said it during the last conversation with you - that our opposition does not recognize democratic rules. It does not respect the principles of the rule of law. They did not refrain from blocking elections for a very simple reason: they would suffer a heavy defeat. They used the coronavirus epidemic to do this. First, they claimed that voting could not take place because polling stations were an epidemic threat, then they announced that voting by correspondence could not be done either. The Senate used parliamentary obstruction their adventurous rhetoric that we are the ones breaking the constitution. In one word, a complete reversal of the meaning of all concepts - giving the words a completely opposite meaning. Because in this case, the government majority did exactly everything to meet the constitutional deadlines, to implement the provisions of the constitution, and this time the opposition did exactly the opposite. .It used all its potential to prevent the fulfillment of the obligations of the Constitution, shielding this practice with a screen of propaganda, linguistic manipulation and, as usual, aggression, which is both - as I think - their social engineering, but also results from their emotional state and huge cultural deficits. These are the reasons for the current state of affairs in Poland, and our task is to get out of this situation and hold elections. Whether it will be possible within the constitutional deadline, i.e. 75 days before the end of the term of office of the acting head of state - I cannot guarantee that, it will be very difficult. Everything is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. Its possible decision, because the Supreme Court makes independent decisions, may, in our opinion, produce an effect similar to the situation that occurred after the so-called vacancy of the office. Will it be possible to change the candidates? Will it be necessary to reconvene? signatures? - Everything is in the hands of the Supreme Court. Recognizing the elections as invalid will result in new elections, and thus the possibility of submitting new candidates. But there is also another path - ordering the voting to be repeated. Then we have a continuation of the already started procedures and the same range of candidates. In the first In this variant, the elections are held within 60 days from the moment of their announcement by the Speaker of the Sejm. I repeat: within 60 days, not after 60 days. Therefore, June dates would be possible. In the second variant, the date is the decision of the Speaker of the Sejm within the provisions of the constitution (up to 75 days) or maybe (although I have doubts here as I used to be a lawyer) the decision of the Supreme Court. The Consensus with the Agreement assumes an amendment to the act on postal elections adopted a few days ago, so we can expect a repetition of the Senate's actions in this matter - a 30-day quarantine. - Most likely they may you are right. However, everything depends on the Supreme Court, so we have to wait for when it will make a decision and what its content will be. However, I would like to emphasize one thing clearly. By rejecting the Senate's veto, we saved the possibility of holding elections in accordance with the law and at the same time not introducing a state of exceptional. Declaring a state of natural disaster in a situation in which we are effectively countering the epidemic under existing regulations would be an obvious and open violation of the constitution. The opposition's proposal to use the state of emergency to postpone the elections would mean treating the effect as a premise, i.e. committing a grave and obvious constitutional tort. Our action in this direction is therefore excluded. What's more, it can be assumed with a high degree of probability that the introduction of a state of disaster would trigger the so-called legal industry to obtain compensation. However, it cannot be ruled out, bearing in mind the reprivatization scandal in Warsaw, in which part of the law firm she simply claimed that this was one of the motives of the opposition and some of the legal circles supporting it. Perhaps they saw it as a chance to make a lot of money, because it cannot be ruled out that even a short-term state of emergency would create grounds for effectively applying for compensation, not only for small entrepreneurs, but especially for large international corporations. In your opinion, is the adoption Act on postal voting effectively ended attempts to block the presidential elections? - I would like to make it clear that now the decisions are on the side of the Supreme Court. We can expect certain decisions, because we know the law. However, we do not know what the Supreme Court judges will rule. Despite the perturbations, the United Right camp remains coherent? - We are a very broad formation. We have our wing quite radical, but we also have another one - moderate or even very moderate, whose representative is Jaroslaw Gowin. Frictions between us are, I think, nothing new. They have happened in the past, for example when adopting the reform of the judiciary. This formula of the United Right camp, although sometimes problematic, is also the source of our success. And we cannot forget about it. It is thanks to the diversity of views and opinions that we are able to achieve victories, and thus exercise power, continue a march during which we are changing Poland. I admit that sometimes it actually means slowing down this process, we have to incur some additional costs, but the balance is still very favorable. And not so much for our formation, but primarily for our country. Therefore, I cannot rule out the possibility that other internal crises will not affect us, but I hope that we will cope with them. The government of the United Right is really changing Poland for the better. Each of the factions making up our formation must always keep this in mind. I hope that this will be the case. Hope, not certainty. Could the scenario of blocking the presidential elections, leading to a crisis and perhaps even destabilizing the country by overthrowing the government have external support? Do you allow for such a possibility? - I admit that at some stage of these turmoil I wanted to speak in the Sejm speech on behalf of our parliamentary club. And I was going to start it by saying that things are clearly going too well in Poland, which is why those who want to spoil it are trying to speak out. We are developing economically, we are modernizing as a country, people are living better and better, even with the epidemic, we are coping better than many other European countries. Let us not have any illusions that there are those who do not like the new, growing player on the European arena. Signals that some of the elites of Western countries are not thrilled with the independence of their dependent countries for decades to the Soviet Union, came to us already in the first half of the 1990s. I especially remember a conversation with one of the then vice-chancellors of Austria, who had a very positive attitude towards Poland, who said directly: they have a bad conscience towards you, use it as much as you can. of course, about the destruction of our country during the war, the crimes, and then being left under the yoke of the communists despite the great sacrifice of our army during World War II. He gave good advice. But unfortunately, at that time, people in Poland began to be told that we had something on our conscience, we we have this ""bad conscience"", i.e. an exercise in shame pedagogy. At that time, I talked to the most important European politicians and believe me, sympathy for Poland and recognizing us as an equal partner was a rare phenomenon. The dominant factor was either a reluctance to support us or a paternalistic approach, assuming our subordination, a lower status. This has changed a lot today, because we ourselves do not allow ourselves to be treated this way. This process began with our first governments, and is still particularly dynamic. President Lech Kaczynski, and the United Right, together with President Andrzej Duda, continues Its traditions. From this point of view, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrestoring to power in Poland those who accepted and even fantastically fit into the post-colonial treatment of us could have appeared. However, when we look at the way this intention was implemented, I am more inclined to admit that we were dealing with some internal initiative, a much less serious undertaking. Did you expect that so many years after the fall of the Polish People's Republic we would have to fight for democratic elections in Poland? - The epidemic was certainly a great excuse for those who wanted to block election of the president and causing a political crisis. I am talking about the epidemic as an excuse not because I downplay it - it is an extremely serious, extremely serious matter - but it does not prevent the functioning of democracy. Therefore, if it were not for the coronavirus, attempts to block the elections would be incomparably more difficult. But I am of the opinion that even if we didn't have problems with COVID-19, there would still be attempts to destabilize the political situation. This is evidenced by the language used by the opposition. The language of reversing the correct meaning of concepts. Calling everything we do a violation of the constitution, although in fact it's exactly the opposite. But why do they act like this? Because for most of the opposition, democracy means their rule. And when voters decide to lose power, there is no democracy. The presidential elections are the last chance for this team to regain at least some influence. There will be no elections for three years. And in my opinion, at some point they believed that they already had the victory in the presidential race in their pocket. There were polls confirming this. But please don't ask me what made PO leaders believe in the possibility of Mrs. Kidawa winning the presidency. -Blonska. I admit that I don't know Mrs. Marshal. But I assume that they got to know her. And for some reason they decided that she had potential. However, returning to the question about the plan and possible external support, I can say that sometimes such a combination occurs an event that produces effects that may suggest the existence of some serious political intention, but in this particular situation I am skeptical about such an interpretation. Why? - Because a change of power is a serious matter that requires the activation of a serious mechanism of action, and it was difficult to find seriousness here. Of course, it never happened it can be ruled out that the combination of circumstances involves the implementation of some political plan, but from my knowledge - I will not go into details today - it appears that this was not the case. Of course, I am not sure. What changes to the Act on Postal Elections do you intend to introduce? ?- The role of the National Electoral Commission will be strengthened, there will be some modifications regarding the procedure for delivering electoral packages and a few other details, but it is still too early to talk about them. And the confirmation of receipt of the electoral package? It seems that this is what Jaros≈Çaw Gowin wanted. - It will be confirmation of package delivery, because the implementation of confirmation of receipt is impossible in the circumstances of the epidemic. Postmen simply refuse this procedure due to the need for quite close contact with a lot of people. Please note that today even important registered letters are not delivered this way. And, of course, their concerns should be understood. But this does not mean that there will be no documentation confirming the delivery of the electoral package. There will be. Their delivery will be carried out by two-person teams, each of them will have a mobile device marking the location, the delivery will be video recorded and recorded in the minutes. By the way, I would like to deny media rumors that there is a lack of people willing to distribute electoral packages. It is exactly the opposite. Too many Poczta Polska employees volunteered, because their participation involves additional remuneration. Is Jaroslaw Gowin returning to the government? - Today, Mrs. Jadwiga Emilewicz is the deputy prime minister. I haven't heard anything about Mr. Gowin wanting to take his former place, but this is the Agreement's decision. There was information in the media that President Gowin will demand that Deputy Minister Zbigniew Gryglas be thrown out of the government. - I know that such reports have appeared, combined with information about his removal from the ranks of the Agreement. The Agreement makes completely independent decisions in this matter. However, according to Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin, Mr. Gryglas is performing his role efficiently and there is no recommendation to dismiss him. In this matter, I rely on the opinion of the Deputy Prime Minister. And in the internal affairs of the Agreement, I do not I'm going in. Some commentators predict that PiS and you personally will look for an opportunity to take revenge on the leader of the Agreement. - This is complete childishness. I deal with politics, the effective implementation of political intentions, not emotional fun. My goal is to maintain the rule of the United Right and, thanks to this, change and strengthening Poland. Our candidate has a great chance of winning the presidential elections, and this, in turn, will give us a good position to fight for the next term and another majority victory. And this is my goal, I looked at these and every other negotiations in these terms in these terms. the United Right camp. Talking about any personal feelings or even ambitions such as ""who is who"" is only the result of the fantasy of some publicists. I will also say this: our coalition should continue, because it is extremely beneficial for Poland, and if its shape were to change, this is only within one club. However, I know that there are those who have other ideas in their heads. My opinion is as I presented it. Have you considered early parliamentary elections, Mr. President? - If the course of events had gone as expected by some, scenario, then such choices would be very difficult to avoid. Although please remember that they could only be achieved through the so-called procedure. three steps, and it is not impossible that at the second stage of this procedure, there might be a choice of prime minister proposed by the opposition formations. Some kind of technical prime minister. I know that they even considered who it could be. Are there political motivations in the actions of the Speaker of the Senate, apart from political ones? personal? Maybe prof. Grodzki, fearing the effects of the prosecutor's investigation into corruption charges, presents himself as a fierce enemy of PiS so that he can say that any possible charges are a punishment for his intransigence, and not the result of witness testimony? - I don't want to judge this case. I only know this much about it. , what I read in the newspapers, including that several dozen people gave their testimony. Therefore, it looks serious and if I were the marshal, I would treat it as such. However, I am afraid that the kind of personal motivations you are talking about may be involved in this many more people in the environment, not only Mr. Grodzki. Although I will also honestly say that I do not think that the Marshal's attitude would have been different if it were not for the ongoing investigation. There is an extremely strong fierceness in politicians from the total opposition resulting from a deep sense of their position being questioned as a result of elections. In fact, although without any substantive basis, they considered themselves the only elite, and we and our supporters as usurpers who dared to reach for functions reserved for them. Therefore, they ran amok. They are able to accuse us of any absurdity, they reverse the meaning. concepts, they shout about the decline of Poland's position, they call on external institutions for help. But this image has nothing to do with reality. People themselves feel that life is better, Poland is gaining in the international arena. Truly, an international function - supposedly exposed, but without any real influence and reducing the person holding it to a position pushing the strongest players - this is not a success. Please look at how these people behave in the Sejm, and in the Senate it is no better. However, in the Sejm it is more visible. On the one hand, we, on the other side the left - I completely disagree with these people, but they behave completely normally. And inside there are constant screams, downright rude remarks, screams, guffaws. Evidently people with cultural deficits, for some reason convinced of their uniqueness. Incapable of any verification of their political actions. They incite this unfortunate Braun to completely scandalous behavior. Everyone who sits in the plenary knows this. It is hard not to notice that this behavior reflects the state of their minds. I will say it completely honestly: the presence of at least some of them in parliament is an insult to this institution, because there should be no such people in this place. Do you expect that the Platform - if it is legally possible - will withdraw Malgorzata Kidawe-Blonska from the elections and replace her with someone else? - Assuming that it will be possible - because it may be , but it doesn't have to - I think that the decision on this matter will be made in Brussels or another place where Tusk usually stays now. If he doesn't want it, and most likely he won't, can they appoint someone else? They don't have it, at least in In my opinion, no substitute who can change their position in a short campaign. For Tusk himself, this is probably not a very tempting prospect, because it is associated with a high or even very high risk of defeat. So what will be the consequences of Mrs. Kidawa-Blonska's electoral defeat for the opposition political scene? - We are thinking about an election result of several percent. The Platform will probably face a very serious crisis. Especially since the so-called candidate of one of the television stations is apparently setting up offices all over Poland. At least that's what he announces. And if he implements this plan, it will probably be to set up political party. The Platform, which is very divided after the political defeat, can probably join its ranks, at least in part. Moreover, the competition to feed the weakening PO will be strong. Because both the PSL and the left will certainly not fail to steal something from its electorate and structures .This is of course speculation. Time will show what will happen.

228398.0," The Government cuts the spending limit of the 2012 Budget by 3.8%, up to 117,353 million_x000D_ The Government has decided today to restore the maximum speed limit on highways and highways at 120 kilometers per hour (km/h) as of July 1, after having reduced it to 110 km/h for four months to save energy. The first vice president of the Government, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba, argued today that at this moment the measure ""does not make sense"", since when it was taken on March 7, a barrel of Brent oil, a reference in Europe, was around 115 dollars in a time of instability in the markets. However, now a barrel of crude oil is around $106 and the forecast is that it will continue to decline, Rubalcaba explained.  The barrel of Brent is trading lower today and at 5:30 p.m. it was 105 dollars after the International Energy Agency (IEA) announced yesterday that it is going to put 60 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserves on the market to alleviate the lack of crude oil from Libya, a country immersed in a civil war for more than three months.  Rubalcaba, who admitted that the decision to extend or not this measure has generated a strong debate in the Council of Ministers, explained that the reduction of the speed limit has saved some 450 million euros, while at the same time it has served to raise awareness among the citizens. ""Society is more aware that running costs, pollutes and has its risks (...). My impression is that Spaniards after this debate are going to run less,"" he said. The vice president recalled that the cost of changing the signs with stickers was around 230,000 euros, the same as the cost of readapting the signs. Sources from the Ministry of Public Works explained that next week the necessary work will begin to change the signals, trying to minimize the effects on traffic in full operation due to the beginning of the summer holidays. Rubalcaba insisted that it has always been a ""strictly economic"" measure, unrelated to the accident rate, and that, therefore, when crude oil prices have fallen they have decided to withdraw it. ""We always separate it from the accident rate. We lower (the speed) simply to reduce the oil bill,"" he insisted.  New Security Strategy Rubalcaba said today that the ""excellent"" Spanish Security Strategy that the Government has approved for the next five years includes risks such as terrorism or other less known risks, such as illegal immigration in the event of ""overflow."" This was stated at the press conference after the Council of Ministers, in which he reported on the approval of this ""global"" security strategy, which Javier Solana has coordinated, and its formal submission to the Congress of Deputies to its parliamentary debate.  P√©rez Rubalcaba has explained that it is a global national security strategy like that of the great countries of the world, such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain or France, which aims to guarantee the security of Spain and its inhabitants. It evaluates all the risks that Spain may face, not only terrorism or those related to drugs, but also other less known risks, such as natural risks or illegal immigration, in case it could become a threat if would cause an overflow.

223305.0," The spokesperson for the PSOE in the Senate assures that in Europe ""they are hallucinating"" that the president of a party like the PP, ""corrupted to the core"", is the one who runs the country ""at a moment as delicate as this"" The spokesperson for the PSOE PSOE in the Senate and general secretary of the PSN-PSOE, Mar√≠a Chivite, said this afternoon in the Senate that the PP, ‚Äúthe party that claimed to be incompatible with corruption, has turned out to be the party of corruption.‚Äù ¬† Chivite made this statement in his turn to reply to the President of the Government, Mariano Rajoy, in the control session that took place in the Senate. The socialist leader asked Rajoy if he was in a position to continue affirming that his Government is one of the best, as he said at the beginning of the legislature, when 4 years later it has turned out to be a Government ""of dubious political stature."" ¬† Mar√≠a Chivite has reviewed Rajoy's ministers, from ""Montoro's rudeness and lies"", to Minister B√°√±ez, ""who ends the strike by invoking the Virgin of Roc√≠o"", or De Guindos ""more concerned about his candidacy for the Eurogroup, that because of the crisis that is plaguing Spanish citizens,‚Äù according to what the socialist spokesperson said. For this reason, Chivite has accused Rajoy of being ‚Äúthe worst president of democracy‚Äù, with a Government whose discredit ‚Äúis unprecedented in our recent history‚Äù and ‚Äúis a shame for the Spanish people‚Äù. ¬† The PSOE spokesperson has also had very harsh words about the corruption of the PP. ‚ÄúYou are an inexhaustible source of judicial summaries,‚Äù Chivite told Rajoy, after blaming him for cases such as B√°rcenas, the bonuses, the financing scheme, the G√ºrtel, the P√∫nica, the Brugal case, the Fabra case, or the Palma Arena case. ¬† For this reason, Chivite has assured before the plenary session that in Europe ""they are amazed"" that the president of a party like the PP, ""corrupted to the core"", is the one who leads the country in a moment as delicate as this."" ¬† For Chivite Rajoy ""he does not run a Government but a Lobby"", and as an example he has reproached him for the interests of Minister Moren√©s with the arms industry, and the ""goings-on"" of Minister Soria with ""certain"" energy companies. ¬† ""Mr. President, I think it is proven that this, far from being one of the best Governments, is a Government that is doing terrible damage to Spain and that violates, with less and less shame, the most basic rules of our democracy,"" Mar√≠a Chivite has pointed out, for whom it is ‚Äúurgent to get out of the spiral of mistrust‚Äù that Rajoy generates, and to recover credit in politics.
